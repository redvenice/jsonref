Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

With great respect, we leave the room and just keep it going.\u0027Trump was optimistic on Friday that a commitment to end the decades-long Korean War and an agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula would pave the way for him to meet face-to-face with Kim Jong-un. Two or three sites are under consideration, he revealed.Trump and Kim, the North Korean dictator, have spent the last year trading threats and insults as Pyongyang made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting America.But amid a softening of relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, the two men have reached an agreement to discuss nuclear disarmament in person.Trump affirmed said he would be meeting with Kim \u0027in the coming weeks\u0027 during a White House celebration on Friday for Olympic athletes.\u0027I want to express my hope that all of the people of Korea, North Korea and South, can someday live in harmony, prosperity and peace,\u0027 he said. \u0027And it looks like it could happen.\u0027           Their dramatic meeting that resulted in an end to the decades long Korean War comes weeks before Kim Jong-un (left) is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, right, next to his suster Kim Yo Jong) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (centre, left) had \u0027serious, frank\u0027 discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a permanent peace in their first summit session on Friday   Trump cautiously praised today\u0027s historic Korea meeting in a tweet this morning then spoke about it at a ceremony for Olympians at the White House.Trump said that people claimed that denuclearization was an \u0027impossibility\u0027 when he began his campaign to force North Korea to its break point.\u0027And now we have a much better alternative than anybody thought even possible,\u0027 he said.This year\u0027s Winter Olympics, held in South Korea, were instrumental to bringing the North and South together. They walked under one flag in Pyeongchang at the Opening Ceremony. \u0027Hopefully the day will come when Olympic athletes can compete on a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons and where all Koreans can live together and care share their dreams,\u0027 Trump today observed.Kim became the first North Korean leader since the 1950-53 Korean War to set foot in the South this morning during talks in which he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to a \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 during the talks.  In tweets on Friday morning Trump acknowledged the progress even as he cast doubt over how long positive diplomacy may last.\u0027After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!\u0027 Trump wrote this morning.In a second message, he added: \u0027KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!\u0027 Trump gave his blessing last week to South Korea, an important American ally, to end the Korean War.The U.S. president has said in recent days that he will meet with Kim \u0027very soon\u0027 and probably by the beginning of June.\u0027It could be that I walk out quickly, with respect,\u0027 he said in a Thursday morning update. \u0027But it could be that the meeting doesn\u0027t even take place, who knows.\u0027           The White House released photos of outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Thursday after Trump revealed their existence          The White House released photos yesterday of former CIA director Mike Pompeo —now Trump\u0027s secretary of state — meeting with Kim during a clandestine visit to Pyongyang earlier this month.\u0027He wasn\u0027t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\u0027 Trump revealed on Fox \u0026amp Friends. \u0027We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting, which I\u0027d love to release if we can, I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the president had said.Eight hours later, the White House published photos of Pompeo and Kim shaking hands, their countenance pleasant without extending into a grin. On Tuesday Trump said that North Korea\u0027s tyrant \u0027has been very open, and I think very honorable\u0027 in the lead-up to nuclear talks.He clarified later, after he came under scrutiny for the remark, that he meant, \u0027I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. A lot is happening. And I think it\u0027s going to be very positive.\u0027Trump said Tuesday, as he met with France\u0027s Emmanuel Macron, that \u0027a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years,\u0027 however he has reason to believe that Kim, a 33-year-old dictator who took over from is father in 2011, is serious about wanting to make a deal.\u0027We have been very, very tough on maximum pressure. We have been very tough on, as you know, trade. We\u0027ve been very, very tough at the border. Sanctions have been the toughest we\u0027ve ever imposed on any country,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we think it will be a great thing for North Korea and it will be a great thing for the world.

However, his finish time was never recorded.According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a fellow runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Mr Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he wasn\u0027t wearing a number and escorted him from the course.\u0027It takes a lot of work to run a marathon.

That man needs to go viral and be named and shamed.\u0027The London Marathon has seen a number of allegations of cheating in its 37-year history.In 2016, TOWIE star James Argent\u0027s sister Natasha had her results removed from the official race website and agreed to return her medal after she ‘ducked under a barrier’ during the race.She was found to have missed 11 out of 24 checkpoints and miraculously finishing the final 20km in just 39mins, quicker than Olympian Sir Mo Farah.In 2014, 34-year-old model Jason Scotland-Williams denied skipping nine miles of the course to achieve a \u0027miracle’ time, the second half of which fell just three minutes shy of the world record – and three minutes faster than Sir Mo.Four years before that, a runner thought to have recorded the quickest-ever time for a pensioner was stripped of his ‘fastest OAP’ title after admitting he took a 10 mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He claimed he had altered his route due to injury.

Then he stopped and seemed to have second thoughts and he turned round walked back against the flow of the race.

We were calling this \u0027Charlie\u0027s Law\u0027 whilst also working on the foundation set up in his memory.\u0027Once cases are public it is difficult for people to be fully aware of the complexities and this often leads to illinformed judgements on both sides and creates unnecessary conflicts.\u0027We have something that is better for everybody - hospitals, healthcare professionals, families with sick children, the NHS, and the reputation of our own government.

You have all been the most crucial part of our fight and we love you all\u0027. Until last night, Mr Evans and Miss James were desperate to fly him to a hospital in the Vatican - but now accept their best hope of leaving Alder Hey is getting him home. Mr Evans said the \u0027warrior\u0027 toddler\u0027s mother has been keeping him alive with cuddles.He said: \u0027Alfie\u0027s fought through the night the last two nights because he\u0027s been lying on Kate\u0027s chest non-stop. And him and his mum have become closer now more than ever before\u0027.  A military helicopter had been put on standby at the request of the Pope, who met Mr Evans last week. But on Tuesday a High Court judge again refused the couple permission to take Alfie to Rome and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal the following day.  After a meeting with doctors, Mr Evans said he and Kate James, 20, and the hospital in Liverpool wanted privacy in order to ‘form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it’.‘In Alfie’s interests we will work with his treating team on a plan that provides our boy with the dignity and comfort he needs,’ he said. The comments marked a huge sea change in the couple’s attitude to medics, whom Mr Evans had previously threatened to prosecute for conspiring to murder his 23-month-old son.Earlier yesterday he had said doctors were treating him and Miss James like criminals. Mr Evans, who wants three of his doctors prosecuted for conspiracy to murder, said: \u0027They hate us. They don\u0027t like us because I\u0027ve fought against them for so long and I\u0027m right\u0027.He added: \u0027We\u0027re not like them. We walk around the corridors and they pop into other cubicles to avoid us. They give us some horrible smug look as if we\u0027re in the wrong. It\u0027s like we\u0027re criminals and we\u0027re being looked down on\u0027.             Alfie, with his father sleeping in the background, is still fighting, his family say, despite a lack of a ventilator            Mr Evans made a plea for supporters to stop their protests in the hope it will convince doctors to let Alfie leave But by 6pm the couple had apparently decided to work with medics, thanking both supporters and hospital staff – many of whom have been the targets of abuse – and said they would not be making any more public comments.‘Our lives have been turned upside down by the intense focus on Alfie and his situation,’ Mr Evans said. ‘Our little family, along with Alder Hey, has become the centre of attention for many people around the world and it has meant we have not been able to live our lives as we would like.‘We are very grateful and we appreciate all the support we have received from around the world... (but) we would now ask you to return back to your everyday lives and allow myself, Kate and Alder Hey to form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it.‘We also wish to thank Alder Hey staff at every level for their dignity and professionalism during what must be an incredibly difficult time for them too.’ Mr Evans’s comments came as protests and vigils were held in Poland, Ireland and the Vatican for Alfie, who was taken off life-support on Monday following a drawn-out legal battle.Doctors say he has a degenerative, incurable neurological condition, is in a deep coma and it is in his best interests to let him die.High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden urged the parents to disregard the advice of ‘pro-life’ campaigners who he accused of manipulating them and to spend what precious time they had left with their son.           People hold candles as they gather to attend a prayer vigil for terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans           Another candlelit vigil in support of Alfie Evans took place in front of the Great Britain embassy building in Warsaw          Alfie\u0027s Army have also gathered outside Liverpool including here at Belfast city Hall to voice their support for the childHe slammed the \u0027malign hand\u0027 of Pavel Stroilov, who works for the Christian Legal Centre (CLC), and called him a \u0027fanatical and deluded\u0027 man whose advice had come \u0027perilously close\u0027 to contempt of court.The couple apparently agreed with the judge, who said their only option was to work with medics to try to move Alfie from intensive care – either onto a normal ward, a hospice or home – for his final days. It came as health chiefs warned hospital staff to hide their uniforms due to threats directed at them after Alfie’s case. It came after a \u0027sick\u0027 and \u0027psychotic\u0027 minority of Alfie Evans\u0027 supporters threatened to \u0027burn down\u0027 Alder Hey and wished harm on doctors as it was revealed police are ready to arrest the trolls. For more information on the Charlie Gard Foundation click HERE "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/4B9B3A3300000578-0-image-m-10_1524818909412.jpg","title":"Pranksters secondary school sale eBay","story":"    Sixth-year pupils at Berwickshire High School were trying to sell their high school building, facilities and \u0027full use of all staff\u0027The listing read: \u0027On behalf of the Berwickshire High School\u0027s Class of 2018, we present the school building, it\u0027s contents and full use of all staff for sale at a bargain price of £2,018.\u0027The building comprises over 50 rooms, 5 bathrooms, excellent sporting facilities, luxury kitchen and a host of other amenities.\u0027However what makes this a great buy is the staff on offer Yolks on him!

Kanye is years ahead of his time.\u0027  Kardashian also hit back at the media, which she said was trying to \u0027demonize\u0027 West.  \u0027Your commentary on Kanye being erratic \u0026amp his tweets being disturbing is actually scary,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\u0027 Don Jr jumped in to show his support for Kardashian, retweeting her defense of West and adding #ImWithHer - the hashtag originally used to show support for Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.West\u0027s public support for Trump even made its way into the discussion at the White House press briefing on Wednesday. A reporter asked Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Trump had reached out to West following the rapper\u0027s recent praise. \u0027I don\u0027t know of any conversation that they\u0027ve had over the last week or so, I\u0027ll keep you posted if that changes,\u0027 Sanders said, breaking into a smile.  \u0027I know they met during the transition, that\u0027s the only meeting I\u0027m aware of that\u0027s taken place, or conversation.\u0027   West first revealed his support for Trump shortly after the November 2016 election, when he told a California concert audience he would have voted for the Republican.\u0027I told y\u0027all I didn\u0027t vote, right?

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse.

So what tangible measures have agreed at the meeting?Inter-Korean Exchanges  Chung Gum Hwang and Yunjong Won lead out North Korean and South Korean athletes during the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games (Mike EgertonPA Images)Following the Winter Olympics, when the two Koreas marched together at the opening ceremony and had a joint ice-hockey team, the two countries have agreed to send joint teams to future events such as the 2018 Asian Games.The leaders also agreed to address the highly emotive issue of reunions between families ided by the war and the border, and to resurrect family visits, which were ended in 2015 as relations on the Korean peninsula deteriorated.The two sides agreed to hold \u0027reunion programmes\u0027 on August 15, the day both Koreas celebrate their independence from Japanese colonisation.After Moon took office last May, his administration quickly asked that the visits resume, but North Korea never officially responded.

North Korean has been working towards acquiring nuclear weapons since the early 1990s and many analysts are sceptical about its conversion to denucleasizationChristopher Hill, who was the lead U.S. negotiator with North Korea under the George W. Bush administration, said the onus would be on the Trump administration to work out the details of a deal.Key hurdles would be to establish a timetable for denuclearization and to overcome North Korean reluctance to allow a verification process.\u0027I\u0027m guided by my experience which was they said all the right things but they gave us a declaration that was not complete and not entirely accurate, and they also failed to give us any kind of verification protocol,\u0027 Hill said. As for unification, the idea remains a distant dream, though one brought a small step nearer by the agreement to end the war, a precondition for talks both sides have long held.The first priority, according to South Korea\u0027s Unification Ministry, is to develop a sustainable relationship and resolve the issue of North Korea\u0027s development of nuclear weapons.South Korea wants to then develop trust and cooperation to the point where a sort of national consensus has been achieved.After a transitional commonwealth period, the next step would be the formation of a single market on the Korean Peninsula \u0027to create new growth engines and create an inter-Korean economic community of coexistence and co-prosperity.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/4B93F62100000578-0-image-m-13_1524817229890.jpg","title":"Brexit Secretary David Davis gives intimate interview","story":"    David Davis has always guarded the privacy of his family.

A flicker of sadness comes into his eyes. ‘No. Not this trip.’Davis has always guarded the privacy of his family. Married to Doreen for 45 years, he says only that the Davis clan is very close, and his office is filled with photographs of them.          Asked if there are any Remainers in his family, he laughs: ‘I wouldn’t dream of asking them. We don’t talk politics at home.

When I go home there is no talk of politics. That’s family time.’One wonders if the absence of his own father in his life is why family matters so much to Davis, and why he is so protective of them.Born to a single mother in York in 1948, he was mostly raised on a South London council estate by his mum, Betty Brown, and stepfather, Ronald.He did eventually track down his birth father, who came from South Wales and was by then a civil servant, but they met just once and there was no happy-ever-after conclusion.Asked if there are any Remainers in his family, he laughs: ‘I wouldn’t dream of asking them. We don’t talk politics at home. Doreen thinks politics is for madmen.’However, he adds that Doreen ‘broke cover’ last weekend. ‘Someone on the radio was going on about Britain remaining in the customs union.‘She said indignantly: ‘‘What? What do you think the people have voted for?’’ It’s the first political thing she has said for months.’The question of whether Britain stays in the customs union — which would prevent the Government negotiating new trade deals with the rest of the world — is also causing serious tensions in the Cabinet, not least with Chancellor Philip Hammond.                             Imagine going clothes shopping and 27 other people have to agree what you’re going to wear                        David Davis on Brexit negotiations Theresa May is under pressure from Tory rebels to agree to a so-called ‘customs partnership’ under which the Government would collect EU tariffs on goods that pass through the UK. Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg have described the proposal as ‘cretinous’, a bureaucratic minefield that is utterly unworkable.But a handful of those rebels who have never been reconciled to the EU referendum result are planning to join forces with Labour and the Lib Dems next month to defeat the Government in the Commons on the customs union — even though it could bring down the Prime Minister.When he is asked about the potency of this threat, Davis leans forward with a steely glint in his eyes, and says: ‘Let me make it very plain. We are leaving the customs union. We have to leave it. It’s what the people asked for.’He leaves us in no doubt that he sees his role as not just representing the Government.‘The people have spoken. They rejected the downbeat view of Project Fear. I have 17.5 million bosses — the ones who voted for Brexit. There is no question that leaving the customs union was a condition of Brexit.’In a pointed warning to the rebels, who include the Europhile veteran Tory Ken Clarke, he says: ‘In our manifesto we said unequivocally that we will leave the single market and the customs union.

To the south-west, it is overlooked by a parade of shops whose dilapidated Victorian edifices are colonised by garish takeaway outlets.A markedly deprived area, it is nonetheless popular with students from the nearby Camberwell College of Arts. It is also home to many young families — the average age here is 33 — many of whose children go to the four primary schools within a few minutes\u0027 walk.          This Chinese buffet suggests customers eat as much as they can, more than 20 courses, for just £7.99 to diners of all ages By the time these pupils are aged ten or 11, the official research shows, more than 50 per cent have a BMI of 25 or above (a BMI of 18 to 24 is considered healthy).It is a sobering statistic, which studies suggest is directly linked to the march of takeaway outlets, whose numbers grew by seven per cent between 2014 and 2017.Those figures make Camberwell Green Britain\u0027s worst area for childhood obesity, with the rest of the top ten comprising eight other wards in deprived London boroughs, including Newington, Livesey and Chaucer in Southwark, Hoxton West and Woodberry Down in Hackney, Lancaster Gate in Westminster, Woolwich Riverside in Greenwich and Royal Docks in Newham, as well as Fenton West and Mount Pleasant in Stoke-on-Trent.Meanwhile, affluent enclaves in the leafy shire towns of St Albans and Harpenden West in Hertfordshire, and Godalming, Surrey, along with Bath and North-East Somerset, are among the best.Tough obesity crackdown could see ban on BOGOF deals for...Avicii \u0027lived on fast food, energy drinks, booze and...Share this articleThese statistics were published this week as Theresa May promised further action if current strategies — including the soft drinks levy and mandatory exercise in primary schools — fail to help.She spoke at Prime Minister\u0027s Question Time after facing calls from opposition parties, coordinated by chef Jamie Oliver, to introduce a 9pm watershed for junk food advertising on television, controls on advertising on streets and public transport, and a ban on buy-one-get-one-free junk food deals.          By the time these pupils are aged ten or 11, the official research shows, more than 50 per cent have a BMI of 25 or aboveThe figures, collated via the National Child Measurement Programme, show 50.9 per cent of Year 6 children in Camberwell Green are overweight or obese, with Newington the second worst area in England at 49.7 per cent.Experts single out two factors as key: deprivation and the ready availability of junk food.Kieron Boyle, chief executive of the charity Guy\u0027s and St Thomas\u0027, which is linked to the NHS hospitals that share its name and works to improve public health in Southwark and Lambeth, says: \u0027These figures highlight the growing \u0027deprivation gap\u0027 when it comes to child obesity. It has increased by more than 50 per cent in a decade, with children in the poorest areas of England now twice as likely to be obese as wealthier neighbours.\u0027Child obesity is overwhelmingly an issue of environment, and too often inner-city areas bombard us with opportunities to eat high- energy food.\u0027It hits children in urban, erse and deprived areas hardest, and we need to design our schools, shops and cities with this in mind.\u0027Measures to reduce the density of the fast food outlets in the area are now in place — but they cannot control the shops already here.Walking around Camberwell Green this week, in one street I counted seven takeaways and budget restaurants in a row, with only a betting shop sandwiched in between. Bins disgorge empty food boxes and half-finished burgers. Even a hardware store also sells food and wine.Around the Green, there are more than 33 outlets. Big brands including Pizza Hut, Greggs, Nando\u0027s, McDonald\u0027s, KFC and Tennessee Fried Chicken vie with nine independent chicken shops plus kebab stores, Indians, Chinese, Lebanese and Caribbean takeaways.          Walking around Camberwell Green this week, in one street I counted seven takeaways and budget restaurants in a rowSchool leaving time, from 3.30pm, is rush hour — and the cheapest shops are the most popular. Morley\u0027s, with its cut-price chicken deal, is thronging. McDonald\u0027s heaves with chattering queues of pupils.It\u0027s here that I meet Vivienne de Bascarli, 43, and her 11-year-old son Italo, who is enjoying a burger. Vivienne, a lunchtime supervisor at her son\u0027s Camberwell junior school, is married to Italo (Sr), a driver. She says the meal is a rare treat.She brings Italo to McDonald\u0027s only once or twice a month because she is concerned that he has been classified as overweight. A month ago, when he was weighed at school, he was 54 kilos (8st 7lb). The average 11-year-old boy should weigh around three stone less.Ever since, he has been on a diet, is taking more exercise and has lost two kilos (4.5lb).Vivienne says her son\u0027s weight crept up after a recent sports injury. \u0027Italo stopped playing tennis and football when he broke his finger — he was playing three times a week — and he started putting on weight.\u0027The school offers these clubs and now he\u0027s playing again, getting fitter and losing weight.          School leaving time, from 3.30pm, is rush hour — and the cheapest shops are the most popular (file photo)\u0027He loves sweets and biscuits, but I don\u0027t buy them at all now. If he wants them, he has to buy them with his pocket money, which he gets only if he behaves at school and helps around the house.\u0027Vivienne, who came to the UK from her native Brazil 15 years ago, cooks from scratch at home, but is aware friends\u0027 children buy their evening meal at the chicken shops.\u0027I know a lot of mums who give their children £1 to buy a chicken meal, and you can understand why,\u0027 she says. \u0027But I think it\u0027s about educating the parents as well.\u0027On a nearby table, Chizoba, 45 — she prefers not to give her full name — sits with her ten-year-old son, who is tucking into a meal of burger and chips followed by ice cream. He, like Italo, has been classified as obese following a school weigh-in.\u0027I love cooking,\u0027 says Chizoba, a widow who lives with her sister and works nights in health care support. \u0027Where I was born, in Nigeria, you watched your mother cook and learned from her.\u0027But my son won\u0027t eat good home-cooked food. He only likes KFC or McDonald\u0027s, and he\u0027d come every day if I let him. As it is, we probably come three times a week.\u0027He\u0027d rather go hungry than eat vegetables, and as a mother I\u0027m not comfortable if he eats nothing. So I give in, and give him what he likes.\u0027Chizoba wonders whether she indulges her son\u0027s pernickety eating habits because he was born very prematurely, at just 25 weeks, and she was so eager to feed him up that she cannot now bear the thought of him going without.\u0027I\u0027ve talked to the doctor about his refusal to eat good food, and he says I shouldn\u0027t worry that he\u0027ll grow out of this phase of fussiness,\u0027 she says. \u0027But I wonder.\u0027She is only too aware of the link between the prevalence of junk food outlets and obesity: \u0027You see a lot of kids just walking along the street eating fast food and I think it\u0027s because parents struggle financially to give them quality food.\u0027I try hard to get good food to tempt my son to eat properly. I go to M\u0026ampS to buy him nice things, and go to cheaper shops for my own food. But nothing seems to work.\u0027She is right to be concerned. Children who are obese when they leave junior school are more likely to develop diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, as well as osteoarthritis and certain cancers, at younger ages. They are also more likely to die prematurely and face disability in adulthood, the World Health Organisation confirms.Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, comments: \u0027It\u0027s common for deprived, low-income areas like Camberwell, with single-parent families who have to work doubly hard to survive, to have a high level of obesity. Fast food outlets thrive in these areas.\u0027It may be relatively expensive, but it\u0027s still a lot cheaper than good, healthy food. And fast food is stuffed full of all the ingredients that cause high levels of obesity — fat, sugar and salt. \u0027Greengrocer Aris Giorgio, 76, has seen vast changes over the 47 years he\u0027s kept a shop in Camberwell, opening it soon after he arrived from his native Cyprus.\u0027These days, mothers aren\u0027t at home because they work, and it\u0027s easier to phone for a pizza than cook,\u0027 he says. \u0027In 1971, when I opened this shop, there were just a couple of restaurants — steak houses. Now we\u0027ve got kebabs, pizza, Chinese, Lebanese, God knows what.\u0027With children it\u0027s difficult. If they\u0027re hungry and food\u0027s available all round them, they\u0027ll eat doughnuts or fried chicken. They won\u0027t go home and cook because they haven\u0027t learnt how to and they can\u0027t be bothered. It takes application and time.\u0027Schools should teach children about food and cooking. Show them broccoli, carrots, turnips, parsnips, because some of them don\u0027t even know what fresh vegetables look like. Get them to identify them first, then learn how to cook them and enjoy eating them.\u0027Aris\u0027s shop is a haven of colour and abundance in the nutritionally void wasteland of the High Street. Piles of sweet potatoes, okra, yams and plantains are stacked alongside beetroot, lettuce, tomatoes, tubs of glistening olives and chillies.For the past four and a half decades, he has risen at 3.30am to buy produce at markets, and kept his shop open til 9pm, seven days a week. Profits are down, he laments, but he soldiers on, helped by his grandson David, 28.Among his regular customers is Cornelius Gray, 65, a retired electrical engineer with London Transport.\u0027There used to be a market on the Green when I was a kid here,\u0027 reflects Cornelius. \u0027It sold fruit, veg, fish. There\u0027s nothing like that now. The fast-food outlets have come in the past ten years.\u0027I\u0027m one of six brothers and we were always out playing. But it\u0027s too dangerous for kids to be out on their own now, so they stay at home on their computers. They don\u0027t exercise.\u0027Serge Cefai, head teacher of nearby Sacred Heart Catholic School, laments the selling of playing fields by local councils. His school compensates with table tennis and five-a-side football on its concrete playground.He provides healthy school meals for pupils, but cannot regulate their choices when they leave the premises. \u0027Naïve parenting is a problem,\u0027 he says. \u0027If children are given money and they have the option of buying vegetables or sweets and chips, of course they\u0027ll make the wrong choices.\u0027And temptation is everywhere. At Poundland, towering mountains of Fox\u0027s biscuits are banked alongside stacks of Maltesers and Chocolate Oranges. Cola lollies entice at the checkout.In the nearby Morrisons supermarket, by contrast, the vegetable display is unalluring. The broccoli bin is empty, and there is a space where the white cabbage should be.

Good things are happening, but only time will tell!\u0027 Trump wrote this morning.In a second message, he added: \u0027KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!\u0027 Trump gave his blessing last week to South Korea, an important American ally, to end the Korean War.The U.S. president has said in recent days that he will meet with Kim \u0027very soon\u0027 and probably by the beginning of June.\u0027It could be that I walk out quickly, with respect,\u0027 he said in a Thursday morning update. \u0027But it could be that the meeting doesn\u0027t even take place, who knows.\u0027           The White House released photos of outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Thursday after Trump revealed their existence          The White House released photos yesterday of former CIA director Mike Pompeo —now Trump\u0027s secretary of state — meeting with Kim during a clandestine visit to Pyongyang earlier this month.\u0027He wasn\u0027t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\u0027 Trump revealed on Fox \u0026amp Friends. \u0027We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting, which I\u0027d love to release if we can, I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the president had said.Eight hours later, the White House published photos of Pompeo and Kim shaking hands, their countenance pleasant without extending into a grin. On Tuesday Trump said that North Korea\u0027s tyrant \u0027has been very open, and I think very honorable\u0027 in the lead-up to nuclear talks.He clarified later, after he came under scrutiny for the remark, that he meant, \u0027I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. A lot is happening. And I think it\u0027s going to be very positive.\u0027Trump said Tuesday, as he met with France\u0027s Emmanuel Macron, that \u0027a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years,\u0027 however he has reason to believe that Kim, a 33-year-old dictator who took over from is father in 2011, is serious about wanting to make a deal.\u0027We have been very, very tough on maximum pressure. We have been very tough on, as you know, trade. We\u0027ve been very, very tough at the border. Sanctions have been the toughest we\u0027ve ever imposed on any country,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we think it will be a great thing for North Korea and it will be a great thing for the world. So we\u0027ll see where that all goes.\u0027Trump reiterated that he would \u0027leave the table\u0027 if the discussions with Kim are not productive — a threat he first made during a summit with Japan\u0027s prime minister in Florida last week. \u0027Maybe it will be wonderful and maybe it won\u0027t. And if it\u0027s not going to be fair and reasonable and good, I will, unlike past administrations, I will leave the table,\u0027 he stated. \u0027But I think we have a chance of doing something very special with respect to North Korea. Good for them, good for us, good for everybody.\u0027           Kim and his South Korean counterpart embraced warmly on Friday after signing a statement in which they declared \u0027there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula\u0027          Kim Jong-un has become the first North Korean leader to step into the South for 65 years as he met with President Moon Jae-in for a historic peace summit on FridayTrump said in a tweet on Friday morning that Chinese leader Xi Jinping deserved credit for the actions he took that helped to bring North Korea to the negotiating table.\u0027Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!\u0027 he stated.China led global reaction to the historic Korean summit today with a quote from a poem that reads \u0027smiling, we meet again\u0027. North Korea\u0027s sole major ally, Beijing said it hoped for a \u0027journey of long-term stability on the peninsula\u0027.China\u0027s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, \u0027We applaud the Korean leaders\u0027 historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage.\u0027We hope and look forward to them taking this opportunity to further open a new journey of long-term stability on the peninsula.\u0027She also cited a poem that reads: \u0027We remain brothers after all the vicissitudes let\u0027s forgo our old grudges, smiling we meet again.\u0027China is a North Korean ally but it has supported a series of United Nations sanctions to punish Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile tests. Beijing has pressed for dialogue to peacefully resolve the nuclear crisis.  Russia has also supported the sanctions and said Friday that the direct dialogue taking place on the ided peninsula is promising.\u0027This is very positive news,\u0027 President Vladimir Putin\u0027s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \u0027Today we see that this direct dialogue has taken place (and) it has certain prospects,\u0027 he said.   The dictator, wearing his trademark black Mao suit, and President Moon, in a navy jacket, hold hands as they walk side-by-side across the demarcation line inside the truce village of Panmunjom at the start of Friday\u0027s summit           Kim and Moon strode past an honor guard and military band, before Moon introduced Kim to South Korean government officials          The two sides were writing up a joint statement and the two leaders would announce it together when it was finished, the official, Yoon Young-chan, told a briefingDonald Tusk, President of the European Council said the messages coming from the talks could serve as a \u0027positive memento to all\u0027, and \u0027that the impossible can become possible, and that it depends entirely on the good will and courage of inidual people.\u0027The White House said in a statement as the conversation was commencing that it was \u0027hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.\u0027 Just months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as the North made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States. But Kim is now due to meet the U.S. President to discuss denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.The White House at its allies credit the \u0027maximum pressure campaign\u0027 that Trump implemented that included robust international and unilateral economic sanctions.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says that he still does not expect a great breakthrough that would curb North Korea\u0027s nuclear ambitions.Johnson told reporters at NATO headquarters Friday, \u0027I am very encouraged by what\u0027s happening.\u0027He said, \u0027I don\u0027t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea\u0027s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point.

However, his finish time was never recorded.According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a fellow runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Mr Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he wasn\u0027t wearing a number and escorted him from the course.\u0027It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It\u0027s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it\u0027s 12 months worth of training,\u0027 Mr Mowbray said.\u0027Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an imposter.

That man needs to go viral and be named and shamed.\u0027The London Marathon has seen a number of allegations of cheating in its 37-year history.In 2016, TOWIE star James Argent\u0027s sister Natasha had her results removed from the official race website and agreed to return her medal after she ‘ducked under a barrier’ during the race.She was found to have missed 11 out of 24 checkpoints and miraculously finishing the final 20km in just 39mins, quicker than Olympian Sir Mo Farah.In 2014, 34-year-old model Jason Scotland-Williams denied skipping nine miles of the course to achieve a \u0027miracle’ time, the second half of which fell just three minutes shy of the world record – and three minutes faster than Sir Mo.Four years before that, a runner thought to have recorded the quickest-ever time for a pensioner was stripped of his ‘fastest OAP’ title after admitting he took a 10 mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He claimed he had altered his route due to injury.

It was a brightly coloured T-shirt, yellow or green.\u0027I thought that was strange as he hadn\u0027t even finished the race yet. Then he stopped and seemed to have second thoughts and he turned round walked back against the flow of the race. I assumed he was going back to get his shirt.\u0027The receptionist from Middlesex, who was running in support of Phab Kids, a charity for disabled children, added:\u0027He wasn\u0027t running at any point.

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/2D964D4200000578-0-image-a-13_1524857487988.jpg","title":"What happens Korea agreed peace unification denuclearization far settled","story":"    Kim Jong-un shakes hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the border between the two Koreas in the truce village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)The two sides have been negotiating on and off since 1972 and much of what has been agreed between Kim and Moon Jae-in has been said before.

She rang her bank to inquire and was told Drew had booked himself a one-way ticket from Sydney to Bali and a week’s accommodation at his favourite holiday resort on the island.“I called the police on him so he’d get dealt with,” Emma said. “I mean, he stole my money. I didn’t know at that stage that the payment had gone through ... Then he went to school, and he didn’t come back so I reported him to the police again and they found him near the airport. An Australian federal police officer told me they would flag his passport and not to worry as he would never get past authorities and on to a plane.“The police brought him home and I gave him a talking to – and it obviously didn’t sink in, because the next day he attempted it again.”This time Drew was taken to a police station near the airport, where a police officer returned his passport before his father came to collect himEmma says she locked her credit card and had no idea the A$3,000 (£1,600) he had spent had been approved. She said she trusted the authorities when they said Drew could never get out of the country on his own. But days later, while Drew was staying at his grandparents, Drew tricked his grandmother into giving him his passport, and told her that he was leaving for school as usual. Instead, having packed his backpack and collected his skateboard and some cash he’d saved up from mowing lawns, he headed for the airport.Staff at the airline for his first attempted flight refused his check-in attempt as he didn’t have a letter of support from his mother, so he got a refund and bought a ticket on another flight – no questions asked – to Perth.In Perth, he later told Australian media, he was questioned by staff who wanted to see ID to prove he was over 12, before he boarded another flight to Denpasar, Bali’s capital.Armed with an iPhone and connected to wifi at the airport in Bali, Drew used an app to rent a motorbike and found his way to the four-star All Seasons Hotel, which he knew from a previous holiday. While there, he bought a beer but only took a sip and threw the rest away. He rented a bike to go sightseeing, paid someone to wash his clothes and played alone in the pool. He ate either on the beach or by ordering takeaway food from his hotel room.Back in Sydney, Emma was panicking. “Everyone kept telling me he would never, ever make it to Bali, so why would I be looking overseas when the authorities were telling me he could never board a flight?” Emma said.After three days, a friend alerted her to a social media post saying Drew was in Bali, but she didn’t believe it. She called people she knew in Bali who confirmed they had seen him.“So then I rang the police and cried and said: ‘You promised me this would never happen,’ and that’s when I collapsed,” she said. Foreign affairs officials, who had asked Indonesian police to collect Drew from the hotel, said Drew’s parents would have to fly to Bali to bring him home. It cost the family another A$8,000 to collect him.Now Emma is speaking out about the loopholes that exist in the airline industry and border control that enable an unaccompanied child to leave the country with no questions asked.“Child trafficking was my number-one fear,” Emma said. “I was so stressed. I was living in a twilight zone. I couldn’t believe what was happening. No one rang me when we brought him home to see if he was OK.“He’s very sorry and he’s very remorseful, but I don’t think he understands the magnitude of what he’s actually done.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64a2a0d6945926d11edbe56de0e7a51987ecb0e/0_51_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f19c27ecb8e1b1228bb28d9be672d0f4","title":"theresa may faces cross party push company public registers overseas territories amendment tory","story":"Amendment has enough Tory backers to implement measure Cameron and Osborne proposed in 2013A group of Tory and Labour backbenchers are increasingly confident they can force Theresa May to introduce public ownership registers in Britain’s overseas territories in an attempt to prevent them from being used to hide “dirty money”.Nineteen Conservative MPs have signed an amendment scheduled for debate in the Commons on Tuesday – theoretically a sufficient number to defeat the government, which has halted plans to implement a transparency measure originally proposed by David Cameron and George Osborne in 2013.The Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is one of the two principal backers of the amendment, said: “There is a spectrum of activity that starts with tax avoidance and then quickly goes on to money laundering and organised crime. Britain and its overseas territories have become the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money because of the secrecy of our offshore ownership laws.”More than half of the offshore companies referred to in the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. The jurisdiction allows people to register companies in secret, prompting accusations that it is easy to hide cash and assets without external scrutiny.Conservative supporters of the amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill are led by Andrew Mitchell and include the former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Crabb and Ken Clarke. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, are also backers.Mitchell said he was hopeful the government would recognise the strength of parliamentary opinion on the subject and find a way of “elegantly getting off the hook”.He said: “The argument that the registers are available in private to UK authorities is insufficient. Public registers allow reporting and discussion of these matters by the media and civil society, as was demonstrated by debate that followed the leak of the Panama Papers.”No 10 said on Friday it was studying the amendment carefully, prompting speculation that ministers may attempt to broker a compromise. “We want to analyse its effectiveness. This is an important issue and one we want to get right,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. There are 14 British overseas territories, with a combined population of 350,000. Several have become major offshore financial centres, including Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar and the BVI.The overseas territories have introduced private central registers of ownership, which are accessible to UK law enforcement and tax authorities. The amendment calls on them to make those publicly available by December 2020, or have UK ministers impose that requirement upon them via orders in council.Some of the territories have expressed opposition to the imposition of public registers, with one leading offshore centre saying it would cost its public purse $100m (£72m) a year.In March, in a previously unreported submission, the BVI government told British MPs debating the bill that such a move “without consultation or consensus effectively disenfranchises the BVI legislature and its electorate creating resentment and damaging the historically strong relationship between the BVI and the UK”.It said the territory was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma and could not afford to deal with the effects from lost revenue. The BVI called on the UK government “to foot the bill or see a crisis in the BVI’s public services. Over the next 10 years this could result in an additional funding gap of $1bn.”Proponents of the amendment have lobbied government ministers. In an attempt to allay Foreign Office concerns about introducing the disclosure measure so soon after the hurricane, the backbenchers agreed to leave the timing for implementation until 2020.The sanctions and anti-money laundering bill is nearing the end of the parliamentary approval process, with its report and third reading in the Commons scheduled for Tuesday, having passed through the Lords."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f66a12845628109a56b2e39d44c91c9837c4b622/0_1_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a0dba8c96f539c990f2f170b3e0a603","title":"david davis brexit tory government talentless","story":"It’s long been traditional to describe a lazy performance by an actor as phoned in. In the case of DExEu’s David Davis, however, he doesn’t even text it in. The secretary of state’s performance in front of the Brexit select committee this week basically amounted to a series of emoticons. He\u0026nbspcan’t do you an explanation of how in the name of magical thinking the government can square its promises on the Irish border with promises on leaving the customs union – but he can do you the shrug. ¯\\_(ツ)_¯ Did you miss it? Don’t worry. Just ask him another question and he’ll do it again.At such a late stage of the game, it is unclear quite how many civil service lectures on the problem Davis has failed to pay attention to. But on this evidence, he urgently needs to be bored harder over the hard border. Or perhaps the looming crisis point is what he wants. Perhaps Britain has had enough of exports.Since before the referendum was even a twinkle in\u0026nbspDavid Cameron’s eye, leavers have been immeasurably helped by the fact that many of us – most\u0026nbspof us? – don’t understand the simplicities of Brexit, let alone its complexities. I recently watched an ITV news dispatch from Norway’s border with Sweden during which I discovered that either Davis did not know what the word “frictionless” meant, or was hoping no one else did. On this basis, Joan Crawford and Bette\u0026nbspDavis had a frictionless relationship.I can only recall one hard lesson from Theresa May in the past year, when she said to the nation: “If we don’t get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen. If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right, we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children’s children too.” And yet, in context, even this is not the moment of brutal candour it appears. May made these comments outside Downing Street in the course of a ludicrously aggressive diatribe against the EU, immediately after returning from Buckingham Palace to call her Darwin award-winning election.Last August, it emerged that some on the EU side of negotiations thought it impossible that the UK side should be as under-prepared and aimless as they seemed, and that it must all be a clever ploy. Pretty sure no one’s floating that theory any more. What’s somehow more unsettling, though, is the look on the faces of Brexiteers outside the inner circle as they realise we really are winging this. This week even such allies appeared concerned by Davis’s shallows.Elsewhere in the government of all the talentless, Amber Rudd’s eye-catching decision to make her terrible week worse is drawing conspiracy theories of its own. On Thursday, the home secretary popped to the Commons to apologise for misleading them over Windrush again, then told journalists she “was not going to be drawn” as to whether Britain would stay in the customs union, despite May saying it wouldn’t. It’s a mark of the government’s baroque dysfunction that the embattled Rudd’s gaffe was regarded by some as a cunning ruse. “I think a lot of people in government are willing us on,” judged one Tory customs union rebel.Underpinning all this is the government’s own structural problem – namely, the impossibility of even the sympathetic half of the audience being able to suspend their disbelief. These people might back them,\u0026nbspbut do they really believe them? We all know what they did two summers ago.The cabinet is now cobbled together from two sides of the referendum ide, each of whom accused the other of the most despicable lies during the campaign. Ever since, preposterously, they have expected the public to accept they are telling the truth when they act together. How is this supposed to work?It is difficult to overstate the absurdity of the home secretary presenting any sort of united front with the foreign secretary, for instance, given that she explained to a TV audience of millions: “Boris? Well, he’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.” This is a date-rape joke with a drink-drive cover story – a memorable attempt by Amber to cast herself as the Iceman to Boris’s Maverick. I’m not precisely sure where that metaphor leaves us after the past fortnight, but it’s fair to say that if world war three does threaten to break out, you don’t want Amber within two continents of a fighter jet cockpit. It feels more as if we’ve reached the point in a movie where Theresa May is using Rudd’s political corpse as a bullet shield.Or have we? In the sort of masterstroke of comic timing many have come to expect from this outfit, we learned on Thursday of the “war chests” that have been built up this year by cabinet ministers thought to be eyeing leadership bids. As the Sun revealed, those big beasts are: Gavin Williamson (who no longer sells fireplaces), Michael Gove and Amber Rudd. But of course. Reflecting on her abject and shameful Windrush failures this week, Rudd said: “I look back with hindsight and I’m surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner.”The same might be said of the government’s quarter-arsed handling of negotiations with the EU. What will eventually unite many leave and remain voters, one suspects, is the enraged conviction that the politicians should have known what they were doing with Brexit, and rather sooner than this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f2877e69abd92555841e6248ed8a618ccf39deb/0_0_3500_2337/master/3500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fdf1ac88c298f1177e12442c4d96db1b 1760w","title":"peter rabbit hereditary trailer years scariest film australia perth","story":"‘Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop,’ says audience member as teaser for horror film Hereditary is mistakenly aired before Peter Rabbit screeningFamilies were forced to flee an Australian cinema when a trailer for a horror film dubbed “the year’s scariest film” was accidentally shown before a school holidays showing of Peter Rabbit.WAtoday reports that the incident occurred an Anzac Day holiday screening of the Beatrix Potter adaptation at Event Cinemas in Innaloo, Perth. As audience members settled down for the film, a trailer for Hereditary began to play. The film, which stars Toni Colette, has received an MA15+ rating in Australia for “themes of strong horror”. Its trailer features a number of unsettling scenes, including one in which a child appears to cut the head off a dead pigeon with a pair of scissors.“It was dreadful. Very quickly you could tell this was not a kid’s film,” an audience member told the newspaper. “Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids’ eyes and ears. Some parents fled the cinema with their kids in tow.”The cinema eventually switched off the screen, and later offered audience members complimentary tickets as a gesture of goodwill. A spokesperson for Event Cinema’s parent company, Event Hospitality and Entertainment, said that the issue was being “investigated internally to ensure situations like this do not occur again”.This is far from the first time a screening for a family-friendly film has been preceded by an unsuitable trailer. In 2012, a cinema in south London accidentally screened trailers for horror film The Devil Inside and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, which stars a flaming skeleton on a motorbike, ahead of a showing of Puss in Boots, while in 2013 a teaser for Lars von Trier’s sexually explicit arthouse drama Nymphomaniac appeared in advance of a screening of Frozen in Florida.

The walls were slimy and cold, and the water smelled like a toilet. I thought I was going to dieEarlier this month, I was having a family picnic on Easter Sunday in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, with my auntie and cousins. While the little kids did an Easter egg hunt (I’m 13), me and my three cousins went off to play soccer. After kicking the ball around for a bit, we found an abandoned building on the edge of the park, so we climbed over the fence and started playing tag. I wasn’t looking where I was going when I felt a piece of wood underneath me break, and I fell 25ft into a pipe.I landed into water and it was running pretty fast. It felt like being on a waterslide, but the water smelled nasty, like a toilet. It was dark, so I grabbed my phone from my pocket to use as a flashlight, but the water knocked it out of my hand and I lost it. In those first few moments I panicked – I thought I was going to die.After a few minutes of sliding, I found I could put my hands against the wall of the pipe and stand up. The walls were slimy and cold, the water was up to my knees and the pipe was about 4ft wide. I shouted for help but I could just hear my own voice echoing back to me and the sound of rushing water. I started crying a little because I was so scared. I was in the dark, alone, thinking, “Where am I?” and, “Will I ever get to see my family again?” I kept seeing the face of my little sister, who is 18 months old, and my Mom, who’s pregnant. I wondered if I’d ever get to meet my baby brother.I thought about trying to carry on walking through the pipe to find a way out, but it looked scary so I decided it was better to stay put and hope that someone would find me. I was praying to God, “Please, please get me out of here safe.” We pray a lot at home, but that day I was really praying.Not too long after that, I heard helicopters and I knew people were looking for me. I started relaxing and thinking I was OK, I was going to be rescued. But when nobody came after what felt like hours, I went back to thinking I was going to die. I wasn’t really hungry or thirsty or tired, I just knew I had to wait. Over 12 hours after I’d first fallen in – around 5am – I saw a light above me and I heard someone shout, “Here’s the kid!” I started calling for help, and a rope got lowered down with a platform at the bottom of it, so I just held on and they pulled me out through a manhole. I felt disoriented when I came to the surface. I was by a freeway with all these flashing lights. They gave me a phone and I called my mom. I said, “Mom, I’m good. Where you at? You need to come pick me up.” She was crying and saying, “Oh my God, where are you?” over and over again.The firefighters took my T-shirt off, hosed me down and wrapped me in a plastic sheet. Someone gave me a Gatorade, but I only drank a little bit because I don’t really like it and I didn’t feel thirsty. At the hospital I took a hot shower and they gave me a change of clothes and put me on an IV drip. After a couple of hours the doctor told me I was fine – I just had grazes on my knees and knuckles from the fall – and my mom and stepdad took me home. All my family were waiting for me, and I hugged them and went to sleep for a few hours. When I woke up, there were news reporters outside waiting to interview me, which was weird.I found out that when I fell into the pipe my cousins ran back to my family and the adults phoned 911, but it took a long time to find me because I’d travelled about a mile from where I fell. They’d sent cameras down to look for me. They only found me because a camera picked up my handprints in a pipe. Over 100 people were involved in the search, so I felt bad I’d caused all that drama, but happy that they hadn’t given up on me. I heard there were toxic gases down there, so I was lucky.Three days later, I went back to school – I just wanted to get back to normal. Everyone in my class was asking if I was OK.Sometimes in my mind I go back to the moment when I fell and think about what would have happened if they had never found me. Thank God I got another chance.• As told to Kate Wills.Do you have an experience to share?

Or the wasted time anxiously wondering if the invitation to play Trivia Crack from an ex is actually a message.Hours are lost poring over the ins and outs of lives you barely recall meeting. That’s the thing about having an account for over a decade, as I have: people who’d usually be relegated to the crevices of memory are kept in full view, as you are to them. Supposedly, that’s keeping in touch, but in reality it’s keeping score.And then, of course, there’s the family. You can’t deny your mum’s friend request, or her right to share your holiday photos to her profile, while mistagging all your relatives – so instead of flagging your pic to Uncle Abbas, she’s let everyone in the ABBA fan page know you ate a pizza in Italy.(Side story: a few years ago, a friend told her mum that “FML” – internet slang for “F*** my life”, a sign of exasperation – stood for “From Mum with Love”. That really livened up her Facebook statuses. “Nan came over for dinner, FML.”)Ergh… that little red notification box, the little red box of horror. It has controlled me for too long, especially with its most vicious feature: event invitations. “You have been invited,” reads Facebook, in its distinctly chipper Californian voice, “to the engagement party of your ex. Good job!” Or it’s an acquaintance’s uninspiring birthday bash involving a long journey, when the sofa is calling. My finger hovers over the “not attending” button when, lo and behold, I see it, the invite list, full of familiar faces.“Perhaps this will be the party to end all parties,” I\u0026nbspthink. “I can’t miss out… Maybe this party will fortify the friendship of my friends between each other, and I will be left in the cold. I can’t miss out.”But no more. If being an adult is about not giving a damn about what people think, then sign me up. No more attending events on the off-chance they might be OK. No more fretting about missing things. No more RSVPing “maybe” when you really mean no, lest you stop getting invited to things you don’t actually want to go to.It’s time to end the cycle.

Adjoining it was a bakery where, every afternoon, chef Angus would make puff pastry for the following day’s croissants, some filled with gruyere cheese, others homemade almond paste or Valhrona chocolate. Sadly, I have neither Angus’s giant roller nor his patience, but there are enough really good ready-made all-butter pastries in shops that it need not stop you making a deliciously flaky, homemade tart.For a really fast tart, omit the cream, eggs and blind-baking – just strew it with the onions, cheese, thyme and some olive oil. You will need a 28cm springform tart tin.About 320g all-butter puff pastry, in a sheet or block – enough to to cover a 28cm tart caseFlour, for dusting30g butter, plus more for greasing5 medium red onions, or a mix of red and white (about 600g)2 tbsp olive oil3 eggs, whisked1 tbsp good-quality balsamic vinegar½ tsp caster sugar1 small bunch fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped200g mild blue cheese, such as Oxford Blue or Stichelton160g double cream160g creme fraicheSalt and black pepperHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until it is wide enough to cover the tart tin comfortably, with at least a 1cm overhang (or use a ready-rolled sheet). Grease the tart tin and then line with the pastry, pricking it all over with a fork. Chill in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the onions. Do not cut off the root: just peel them like an orange and cut away any straggling strands from the base. Cut each onion into five to six even wedges. Heat the oil and butter in a wide, deep frying pan on a medium-high heat and, when hot, add the onionwedge wedges, season well, and saute for 12-15 minutes.Now remove the pastry from the fridge, line with greaseproof paper and fill to the brim with baking beans. Bake the tart shell for 20 minutes, then remove the beans and paper and lightly brush the pastry shell all over with a little beaten egg. Put the tin back in the oven and bake for eight to 10 minutes, until golden.The onions should now be caramelised beautifully. Drizzle with balsamic, sugar, half the thyme and two tablespoons of water, and cook for a further eight to 10 minutes, until the onions are soft and dark. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.Beat the creams together, add the remaining eggs, whisk with the rest of the thyme and season well with salt and pepper. Arrange the onion wedges on the base of the tart shell, crumble over nuggets of the blue cheese, pour over the cream mix and bake for 25-30 minutes.When cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes. Serve still warm with a crisp chicory and toasted walnut salad, or a simple green salad.This tart is very good eaten at room temperature and lasts several days. Whizz any leftover blue cheese with sherry vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil – a wonderful dressing for the last of the year’s bitter leaves. Finally, make a simple sweet tart with any leftover pastry – delicious filled with chocolate ganache or rhubarb and a great excuse to eat up the leftover creme fraiche."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91d49f8573616d1b09520402b0f4256060ec2798/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d8f27f8a46e6ddf8d2e0a0b184e80cd","title":"blind date becky daniel","story":"Does Becky, 26, barrister, find in favour of Daniel, 36, hospital doctor?What were you hoping for?Good food and company.What did you talk about?The criminal barristers’ and junior doctors’ strikes, port and Couch to 5K.Any awkward moments?I may have inadvertently drawn attention to the 10-year age gap.Good table manners?Impeccable.

Instead, she can recall every second: the moment she threw herself into her father’s arms, before clinging to her mother and, in a gesture of disbelief and gratitude, raising an arm to the heavens.The reason everything is still so clear 12 years on is because the reunion took place on television, and she has rewatched it many times. “I thought in that moment I’d died,” Clemantine says. “You hear about how you’re united with the people you love in heaven, and I thought, this must be heaven. I was so happy, but I was also scared: had I died?”It was 2006, and Clemantine and her sister, Claire, thought they were being invited to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show to discuss their experiences of the Rwandan genocide. But, unbeknown to the sisters, the show’s producers had flown their family in from Africa. The last time they had seen their parents was in 1994, but although they knew they were alive, they had been able to speak only by phone and had no idea when they would be able to meet they had also missed the birth of a new brother and sister, then aged eight and five.They’d had, Clemantine says, an idyllic childhood, growing up in the Rwandan capital, Kigali: her father ran a taxi business and her mother’s life centred on the family garden, where they grew mangoes, lemons and papayas alongside hibiscus, geraniums and peonies. The family were Tutsis, although that didn’t seem significant until the slaughter began.For Clemantine, the first sign of trouble was when her parents started to talk in whispers. Neighbours were disappearing, and there were loud, ugly sounds in the air that her brother Pudi said were thunder (Pudi survived the genocide, but died of meningitis before the reunion). One day, her mother told Clemantine, then six, and Claire, 15, to pack because she was sending them to their grandmother’s farm a few hours south. Her parents had hoped they’d be safe there, but a few days later there was a knock at the door and her grandmother told the girls to run. They ran her grandmother, cousins, aunts and uncles were killed.The only thing Clemantine managed to take with her was a rainbow towel. “I held on to it. Claire and I lived on fruit. Days were for hiding, nights were for walking. Suddenly, we were refugees.”They remained refugees for the next six years, wandering through seven African countries. Clemantine’s book, published this week, details the highs and lows of that extraordinary journey: the refugee camps, foraging for food, the illnesses and unexpected kindnesses that taught them how to hold on to hope. Finally, when Clemantine was 12, she and Claire were given asylum in the US – She went to live with a family in Chicago and Claire, who by then had children of her own, lived nearby.In those early years in the US, Claire had a cleaning job, and Clemantine often helped her out. “We didn’t have a TV, but we discovered Oprah by watching it where we were working. We’d always make sure we were cleaning the sitting room at 4pm so we could catch her show. Claire used to say, ‘We’ll meet her one day, I just know we will.’”Clemantine entered a high school essay-writing competition, organised by Oprah’s show, about Night, Elie Wiesel’s book about the Holocaust, and why it was still relevant. She wrote about her experiences in Rwanda, which led her to Oprah. When the sisters were invited on, they could hardly contain their excitement. “They put us up in a hotel, and we thought, ‘This is insane: we’re going to meet Oprah!’ We spent hours getting ready.”Clemantine and Claire were in the audience when, midway through the recording, Oprah spoke to them from the stage. She asked Clemantine how long it had been since she and Claire had seen their parents, then she held up an envelope and said she had a letter from them. “She called us on to the stage,” Clemantine says. “Claire was holding on to me, she was shaking. Oprah handed me the letter and I began to open it, but then Oprah put her hand on mine. She said: ‘You don’t have to read it right now, in front of all these people, because… your family is here! We have flown your family here.’”Clemantine couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “I’d been praying and hoping for so long that I’d see my family – it was the constant thought in my mind. I remember when we were in South Africa, there was a man who looked exactly like my dad and I used to wait for him on the street when I knew he’d be passing, just so I could see him.”Now, with no warning , she was being swept up into her father’s arms, hugging her mother, cuddling her siblings. “Everyone was crying: everyone in the audience, all the crew. Everywhere you looked, there was someone with tears running down their face. They had to have a 30-minute break, just to give people time to recover, before they went back to recording the show.”In her book, Clemantine recalls how, after the show, the family were driven by limo across the city to Claire’s apartment. “Nobody talked in the car. In the apartment, nobody knew what to do, either. My mother, in her long blue dress, kept sitting down and standing up and touching everything. My father kept smiling, as if someone he mistrusted was taking pictures of him. Claire remained nearly catatonic: rocking, stone-faced.”Over the next couple of days, they went sightseeing in the botanic garden and for a ride on a ferris wheel, and then, on Monday morning, Clemantine’s parents and her siblings flew back to Rwanda. Clemantine went back to school.Today, Clemantine’s family have all moved to the US. They live in Chicago, and she lives in San Francisco. Now 30, she works as a human rights advocate. But the years of separation, she says, have left deep scars. “Claire and I are different people, and it’s hard to connect with our parents, because so much was taken away from us. When we’re together, we don’t really know where to begin it’s difficult even to have a conversation.” She devoted her studies to researching the effects of family separation she’s fascinated, she says, by how people are affected by loss, and what can and can’t be recovered after a family is ruptured.For her part, Oprah described the onscreen reunion as “one of the deepest, most joyful moments I’ve ever experienced”, calling it “beautiful… raw, raw, raw… pure”. What, though, does Clemantine make of it, 12 years later: was it right, or fair, that she and Claire were put through such a pivotal, emotional experience with no warning, and in front of millions? “You know, when people watch that clip they always feel something. Some feel joy, some feel sadness, some feel confusion, some feel anger. But for everyone it’s a trigger-point for something, and what I think it does, more than anything, is underline the power of our stories and the power of sharing our stories. Everywhere I go in the world, people have watched that moment and know what happened. I met someone from Australia who told me that clip had changed her life. So whatever anyone feels about it, it’s testament to the power of the human story and the power of reunion. I feel happy about that.”Commenting on this piece?

She hates the idea of it, and the colour, and the way it gurgles when you plug it in.“It’s the quietest one they make,” I say.“I’m sorry, but I can’t have that thing in here,” my wife says.“I didn’t buy it for you,” I say.The only member of our household who hates the cat fountain more than my wife does is the cat: it walks a wide, cautious circle\u0026nbsparound it on its way to the catflap and out to the door of my office shed.“Miaow,” the cat says.I know what this means. It means: turn on the kitchen tap so I can drink from it.“Can I just direct your attention to the new system?” I say to the cat. “You may have noticed an intriguing device on your…”“Miaow,” the cat says.“I understand that,” I reply, “but it’s up to\u0026nbspall of us to give this new system a chance, because 30 quid is a lot of…”“Miaow,” the cat says.I get up, go into the kitchen and turn on the tap.Even as my wife disparages the cat fountain, she remains inordinately enthusiastic about the expensive rocks I\u0026nbspbought to put in the dog’s water bowl to stop its pee burning brown holes into the lawn. I, on the other hand, feel so foolish about this purchase that I hate being reminded of it.“I think your rocks are really working,” she says.“Of course they aren’t,” I say. “How could\u0026nbspthey possibly work?”“I’ve noticed a real improvement,” my wife says.“Anything that could actually purify dog piss would also kill the dog,” I say.Maybe this is what I’d secretly hoped the\u0026nbsprocks would do then I could have blamed the man at the garden centre for letting me buy them.Two days later, I find the cat fountain unplugged on the back step, slowly filling with rain. Even as I take it back inside the house, I\u0026nbsprealise that I’m going to lose this battle. I plug in the fountain and return to my desk. A squirrel pauses by the little window above my computer screen to give me a hard stare. Perhaps I erected my shed on top of his buried nuts.Midweek, the weather suddenly turns warm and the tortoise emerges from his winter hiding\u0026nbspplace under the oven. After sitting in\u0026nbspa square of sunlight on the kitchen\u0026nbspfloor for a few minutes, he slowly makes his way to the back door, levers his weight over the threshold, tips down the steps and plonks himself in the middle of the lawn, where he contentedly crops the\u0026nbspgrass. Then, when I have stopped watching, he turns west and devours an entire bed\u0026nbspof annuals.“I’m not having my garden wrecked,” my\u0026nbspwife says, locking the tortoise in the sitting room. “I’ve\u0026nbspordered a cage.”“You can’t cage his spirit,” I say.“Watch me,” she says.On Saturday morning, I try to enjoy the\u0026nbspgood weather by reading the paper on a\u0026nbsplawn chair, but the tortoise is looking at me, his head poked between the bars of his new rabbit run.“He’s furious,” I say.“I don’t care,” says my wife, who is busy replanting annuals.I make a brief attempt to entertain the bright side – where there is cage, I think, there is also lawn the dog can’t piss on – but\u0026nbspthen I look down again. It’s easy to read\u0026nbsptoo much into a tortoise’s expression, but there does seem to be a bottomless resentment in his eyes, as cold and still as one of the Elgin marbles, and conveying the\u0026nbspsame demand: send me back to Greece where I belong.On Monday morning, a spring chill returns to the air. As I walk out to my shed, I\u0026nbspcatch the cat lapping rainwater from\u0026nbspthe folds of a bin liner – a bin liner that may well\u0026nbspcontain a cat fountain.The cat spots me and stops.“Well, well,” I say.“Miaow,” the cat says.“I thought you were some kind of hygiene freak,” I say, “yet here you are, licking water off rubbish.”“Miaow,” the cat says.“I’ll write about whatever I please,” I say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be8890917d3b5e63589529ae7c963b645318674/0_186_4862_2918/master/4862.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b0996bb1d3a96395be3d3079d9965da","title":"post malone beerbongs and bentleys review","story":"There are powerful choruses and strong vocals from the chart-topping, face-tattooed rapper, but his guests show him up as a weak lyricistThe documentary film Post Malone Is a Rockstar that accompanies the release of his second album strikes a defiant note. In among the glowing testimonies to his talent and humility from colleagues, old schoolfriends and – an unexpected move, this – a man who doesn’t seem to know who Post Malone is, there is much talk of his resilience to criticism, his bird-flipping attitude to those who “talk shit” about him.You can see why a thick skin might be an essential character trait for Austin Richard Post. The reviews of his debut, 2016’s Stoney, weren’t so much vicious as dismissive: it was held to be the work of a one-hit wonder who never should have been allowed to make an album in the first place. It went on to sell 2m copies in the US alone, and spawn a succession of hit singles. He has weathered accusations of cultural appropriation and the opprobrium of other rappers, who possibly remember the last time a long-haired white guy with a liking for both rap and down-home American rock got big – Kid Rock – and how well that turned out for everybody. The press, meanwhile, can’t seem to work out whether they think that, with his belief in chemtrails, obsession with firearms and I’ve-suffered-racism-too response to Black Lives Matter, he’s just an idiot – a conclusion you might jump to, based on the haircut he sported last year, a mid-forehead fringe that left him looking like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber – or something more cynical and calculating. Suspicious eyebrows were raised regarding the veracity of the recent viral story about him giving a postal worker a copy of his forthcoming album in lieu of a tip. His 2017 hit Rockstar was helped to the US No 1 spot by a YouTube video that featured not the song, but just its chorus repeated five times, which, depending on your perspective, is either cheating your way into the charts, a brilliant marketing ploy aimed at the Musical.ly generation who consume not songs but sections of songs, or the kind of incisive editing by which a lot of chart singles could be vastly improved.Throughout it all, Post Malone has got bigger and bigger: he’s as impregnable as barbed wire, which, in another curious fashion decision, he has tattooed across his forehead. Which brings us to his second album, pretty much a guaranteed smash. If you cleave to the just-an-idiot theory regarding Post Malone you might note that, well, it’s called Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys, that its lyrical rendering of the current vogue for moaning about the emptiness and misery of wealth and success tends to the thumpingly prosaic – it contains a song called Rich and Sad – and that he writes about sex in such a dummkopf way, it makes you feel like taking up a lifelong vow of chastity: “I ain’t even seen the face but she got beautiful boobies – wow!”If you think he’s more calculating, you could point to its bet-spreading sound, which melds a host of current big pop memes, from warm, post-tropical house synthesisers to icily Auto-Tuned R\u0026ampB, from earnest acoustic balladry to mumble-rap. “Barf on me,” he pleads repeatedly at one point, which feels a bit alarming until you realise he’s actually saying “ball for me”. There are references to classic rock – Same Bitches swipes a lyric from the Zombies’ Time of the Season, Over Now concludes with a thrilling, distorted explosion of John Bonham-esque drumming – and a great deal of that weird latter-day lyrical trope whereby you spend half your time boasting about how many drugs you take and how much you drink in party-hearty style, and the other half trying to elicit sympathy from the listener because of how many drugs you take and how much you drink.It would be churlish indeed to deny that a lot of the songs on Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys are exceptionally well-turned, stuffed with hooks and powerful choruses: Rockstar’s global success had less to do with shenanigans involving YouTube than the fact that it’s a maddeningly catchy song, and there’s plenty more where that came from. Furthermore, while no great shakes as a rapper, Post Malone’s singing voice is impressive and the production is regularly tricked out with beautiful touches: the lovely Mellotron intro to Rich and Sad the eerie, feedback-and-echo-heavy guitar that runs through Takin’ Shots. However, over a protracted period of time – and Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys goes on and on like a charity telethon – there’s a paucity of original ideas, the sense that he has virtually nothing to say for himself, and that whatever he has, has already been said umpteen times before with considerably more skill, wit and impact. Meanwhile, the guest appearances are a mixed blessing. An impressive array of supporting talent has been assembled, seemingly with the express intention of showing Post Malone up: the gulf between what he does and the sparky power of Nicki Minaj’s guest verse on Ball for Me – “could have been a seamstress, still wouldn’t cut him slack” – feels immense.Of course, Beerbongs \u0026amp Bentleys’ defects might be less evident in smaller doses, if you consider it less as an album than a collection of songs made for picking and choosing, for filleting on to playlists, then the aforementioned hooks, choruses and production touches might well outweigh the repetitiousness and predictability. Listening to it, you understand both the charges against him and the reasons for Post Malone’s success, and you wonder how long his apparent impenetrability will last. Whether he can move with the times when the trends collated here change remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459abf43c4e64ef7c93d1e09166206dc37efa130/0_0_5106_3404/master/5106.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbcd067901de63b7068299f9633e0ead 880w","title":"more than 120 homeopaths trying to cure autism in uk","story":"Exclusive: the ‘cure’ involves detoxing children of vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the conditionMore than 120 homeopaths in the UK are offering a “cure” for autism that involves supposedly detoxing children of the vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the condition, the  has learned.The homeopaths are accredited practitioners of CEASE “therapy”, which stands for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression. CEASE was invented by a Dutch doctor called Tinus Smits, who died of cancer in 2010. His book and website, which lists therapists around the world, describe a method of ridding children of toxins – predominantly vaccines and medication – that are said to cause autism. It involves homeopathic remedies and high doses of vitamin C in excess of those recommended by national guidelines.Diarrhoea, which could be a result of excessive vitamin C, and fever in children should not necessarily be cause for concern, say CEASE therapists, because it is the child’s body purging itself of toxins.“It’s absolutely appalling,” said Carol Povey, director of the centre for autism at the National Autistic Society (NAS), which helps develop best practice. “As healthcare practitioners, homeopaths should still be working on evidence-based practice and looking at national guidelines.”The NAS is concerned by the suggestion that autism, a developmental disorder, could be cured. It is also disturbed by the claim that autism is linked to vaccines, as proposed by Andrew Wakefield – a theory that has been comprehensively discredited. Wakefield, a former gastroenterologist, was struck off the medical register over his claims.Homeopathic cures, like other bogus therapies on the internet, “hoodwink new parents when they are vulnerable” and can cause harm, said Povey.A minority of CEASE therapists in the UK are members of the Society of Homeopaths. Its regulatory body, the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), has said the Society of Homeopaths must state by the middle of next month what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation.The PSA told the Society of Homeopaths that “CEASE therapy contravenes medical advice by apparently advising against vaccination of children, avoiding antibiotics in the case of infection and advocates high doses of vitamins not recommended for children. We are also concerned that the full name of CEASE (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) strongly implies the ability to cure autism through this therapy,” it said in a statement.While the society had responded that its members “should not be practising the aspects of CEASE that defy medical advice”, this was not clear on its website, said the PSA.Mark Taylor, chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths, said it was looking into how many of its members practised CEASE therapy and whether they complied with advice on respecting medical evidence. “We are looking at the advice we will offer over the next few weeks so there is nothing more to say at the moment,” he told the .Many other homeopaths who are also CEASE therapists are not members of the society. The PSA urges the public to choose only those on its accredited register.Jennifer Hautman, a homeopath who is not a Society of Homeopaths member, says she has used CEASE therapy if parents have requested it. Smits’s book, she says, is written for lay people, who then look for a therapist. “I would never promise to cure anything. I do think autism can be treated. It can be improved,” she said. Children often had gut disorders, she said, adding: “I’m not a gut specialist. That’s what Andrew Wakefield was working on. She claimed: “There are a lot of scientists finding similar results to his.”While the causes of autistic spectrum disorder are unclear, she says on her website that “ASD is often linked to vaccine damage” and asks parents to fill in a questionnaire “if you feel you or your children have been damaged by vaccines”.Asked about the CEASE theory that fever and diarrhoea help expel toxins, she said: “Generally speaking in homeopathy, discharge can be a good thing. If you have infected wounds, you want the pus to come out. If you have diarrhoea you want it to come out rather than be constipated.” A child must not be allowed to become dehydrated, however.Smits, the creator of CEASE therapy, wrote in his book that “all kinds of detoxification reactions may occur” as a result of the treatment. Most common is fever, he said, which “should not be treated with medication, as it is a healthy reaction of the organism and not a disease! ... Eliminations like diarrhea, flu, expectoration, and bad-smelling and cloudy urine should also be left alone, because they are a part of the healing process.”One child he treated had diarrhoea that “relieved his system so much that his autism almost disappeared instantly”. After 10 days, however, his mother was so concerned that she took him to the doctor, who gave him immodium to stop the diarrhoea. “Almost immediately the child had a setback and became autistic as before. The diarrhea was a perfect detoxification for his bowels and brain. Neither the doctor not the mother understood this, and the medication interfered with the progress of the cure,” claimed Smits.Ursula Kraus-Harper, a member of the Society of Homeopaths, told the  she has used CEASE therapy since attending a seminar with Smits in 2010 but that she uses it in conjunction with classical homeopathy. Children started improving after a certain set of detoxes, she said. She did not believe homeopathy was a cure, however.She said she was not against vaccination, but said “vaccines can be a problem and so can medical drugs. That is more and more accepted by everybody who is not blinded by drug-driven medicine.” She denied CEASE put children at risk. “Tell me of one child, one person that has died from high doses of vitamin C,” she said. “When the body has had too much of it, it will produce diarrhoea then you lower the dose and the diarrhoea will stop.”The Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who chaired the cross-party Westminster Commission on Autism, condemned the claims of CEASE therapists to cure the disorder. “There is support and much we can do but there are no cures and if someone says so, show me the evidence,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/122e94c7f810634b67172a355031269eef7cb770/0_119_5019_3011/master/5019.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce79ea89bb6e852d57b089a4dcb9bf5","title":"cleveland cavaliers indiana pacers nba playoffs","story":"Victor Oladipo scored 28 points and posted the first postseason triple-double of his career on Friday night, leading the Indiana Pacers to a 121-87 blowout over the Cleveland Cavaliers to even their playoff series at 3-3. Game 7 will be played on Sunday in Cleveland.The three-time defending Eastern Conference champs again were led by LeBron James with 22 points, seven assists and five rebounds despite sitting out the entire fourth quarter. Nobody else scored more than 13 points as the Cavaliers lost their first closeout game in 14 tries dating to 2009. James had won 11 consecutive closeout games and is 12-0 all-time in the first-round series.With their season at stake, Indiana played hard, aggressive and tough. And it showed with a record-breaking victory margin.Kevin Love hurt his left wrist on a hard fall midway through the second quarter and wound up scoring just seven points while shooting 3 of 10 from the field. James took a shot, too, cutting the side of his left eye when he ran into Thaddeus Young’s elbow on a drive late in the first half. No foul was called and James returned with a bandage protecting his face. But with a relaxed Oladipo figuring out how to defeat the Cavs’ double teams, he rediscovered his shooting touch. Oladipo finished with 13 rebounds, 10 assists and was 11 of 19 from the field and 6 of 8 on 3s to keep the Pacers in charge most of the game. Elsewhere, the Toronto Raptors overcame a halftime deficit in a road playoff game for the first time in 24 tries, using 24 points from Kyle Lowry and a tremendous effort from their second unit to beat the Washington Wizards 102-92 in Game 6 and clinch their Eastern Conference first-round series. Toronto trailed by as many as 12 points in the first quarter and was down 53-50 at the end of the second. The Raptors’ first lead did not come until the third quarter, and they were back down by five points entering the final period. But with star guards Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, who had a personal series-low 16 points, resting to begin the fourth, the reserves led by point guard Fred VanVleet turned around the game. Bothered by a bad right shoulder, VanVleet had played a total of three minutes in the series until Friday, but he was just what Toronto needed in this game, with five points, four assists and four rebounds.The home team had won each of the first five games of the series, but the Raptors were finally able to break that road hex and close things out.

Rare to the point of invisibility are Englishmen who trekked all the way around New Zealand last summer, finished fifth in the recent Six Nations and still have a glint in their eye. Elliot Daly is either a brilliant actor or a serious glutton for punishment.Nor will there be much respite in the next two months. First there is the challenge of banishing the question marks hovering over Wasps and atoning for last year’s Premiership final disappointment against Exeter. Then there is England’s tour to South Africa which Daly, far from sidestepping, is massively keen to be involved in. Given he is also poised to open a cafe in Leamington Spa – complete with baristas tutored by the UK’s five-time latte art champion – the beachside hammock will have to wait.Nail all those goals successfully and the 25-year-old really will have had a special 12 months. Without his long-range kicking and all-round assurance on the wing, the Lions might not have earned their famous series draw against the All Blacks. In his last four Tests for England he has contributed five tries. As a cricketer talented enough to have represented England at under-15 level, he is the nearest thing British sport possesses to a modern-day Wilson of the Wizard.All of which raises a question: how much more influential could he be if he saw the ball more often? England have generally employed Daly in a roving wing role but he initially broke into the national side as an outside-centre and reckons he could also prosper – “There’s more space and you get the ball a bit earlier than you do on the wing” – at full-back. With Bath’s Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson both set to miss the South African tour through injury and Manu Tuilagi’s participation still up in the air, the odds on the Croydon-born flier wearing either 13 or 15 in June must be shortening.How fortunate, then, that the multitalented all-rounder – in his cricket days he used to bowl right-arm quick despite being left-footed and writing left-handed – feels fresher than many of his contemporaries. Injuries, most recently an open finger dislocation which pierced the skin, have allowed him to recharge slightly and rediscover the zest for life currently eluding one of two of his weary colleagues.“You’re still training and trying to get fit but a couple of little niggles does allow you time to get yourself right and get back to firing on all cylinders. I’m ready and raring to go for whatever the end of season holds for us.”Daly, in short, is no poster boy for those insisting future Lions tours from 2021 onwards must be trimmed from 10 to eight games to safeguard player welfare. “I really enjoyed the Lions tour. The length of it wasn’t an issue for me personally. I was involved in eight of the 10 games having played in the Premiership final the weekend before departure. For me it was quite good to keep focused on rugby.”He is smart enough, nevertheless, to sense that even his buzzing energy levels will be impossible to sustain if the switching of summer Tests from June to July from 2020 is not satisfactorily dovetailed with the domestic fixture list. “I don’t think you can play more. We’re kind of playing all year round at the moment. It just needs to be clear because then we can plan for the future.”Even his new caffeine-oriented sideline, it seems, is not going to ert Daly from his primary addiction. One day he fancies playing abroad, possibly in Super Rugby – “I would like to try and play in that kind of rugby but it would have to be at the right time” – but given he signed a new Wasps contract only last September it really would require a major implosion for him to abandon the team he has represented since he was a schoolboy. For all the current frustration caused by Wasps’ continuing lack of a permanent training base, the players’ desire for silverware remains undimmed. As Daly puts it: “This is where we said we wanted to be at the start of the season: in the top four chasing a semi-final.”A free-flowing home victory over the Saints on Sunday would also honour the clutch of established players – James Haskell, Danny Cipriani, Guy Thompson and Sam Jones – bidding farewell to the club this season. “There are a lot of characters leaving so giving them as good a send-off as possible is a big one for us,” says Daly.What will he miss most about Haskell? “It’s a constant case of: ‘He’s not going to say that, is he? Oh, he’s just said it.’ He just doesn’t have an off-button. He says exactly what he thinks but says it with a smile. He’ll be a big loss for the squad.”And Cipriani? At their best, Wasps attack with more thrilling verve than any other side in the country, with Daly’s acceleration complementing his fly-half’s rare vision. “The mindset he brings to attack is something we’ll keep when he leaves,” says Daly. “He’s very gifted in what he does and he knows what he wants to do to defenders. It’s definitely been helpful for me.”Another of his fleet-footed partners in crime, the quicksilver Willie le Roux, could soon be among the opposition when England fly south in June for a three-Test examination of their stamina and recently shaken confidence.Daly is one of many who sense a Springbok side licking their lips at the prospect of piling into their visitors on home soil. “I reckon they’re going to be a handful in the summer,” he says.On the flip side, with two Tests being staged at altitude, his bazooka of a left boot could do the Boks plenty of damage from distance. Assuming Eddie Jones’s side can shake off their Six Nations torpor, the trip would also help erase the memory of his only previous tour to South Africa with England Under-18s.“We lost 2-1 in a best-of-three series which was very annoying. I think we had a kick to win it at the end and missed.” If anyone can help England and Wasps finish their endless winter in style, it is the inexhaustible Daly.Elliot Daly was speaking on behalf of Land Rover, main club partner of Wasps.

To compound the Tigers’ woe, two of their alumni contributed to their downfall, the wing Vereniki Goneva, who scored two tries, and Dean Richards, the Falcons’ director of rugby.Richards side started the evening fourth in the table, two points above the Tigers, but 11 minutes from the end trailed 23-13 having lost three players to injury in the opening 24 minutes.They took the lead after 74 seconds when Goneva took possession from the base of a ruck, dummied the prop Dan Cole and sprinted 40 metres to the line, and the wing salvaged a game that was slipping away when he stepped inside two defenders before flattening George Ford on 69 minutes. The Tigers by then were nursing their lead and were unable to recapture their early momentum. Defeat at Sale next weekend could dump them out of the top six and into the Challenge Cup for the first time, their faint hope of finishing fourth resting on Wasps blowing up.Leicester dominated the set pieces but in possession they were a mixture of the slick and the slack, a break and deft off-load too often followed by a knock-on. Newcastle spent most of the match seeking the sanctuary of the ropes but they were never put down and nothing, not even injuries, a mounting penalty count or the increasingly heavy rain could dampen their resolve.Leicester responded quickly to Goneva’s first try by working space for Jonny May and took the lead when Ford replied to Joel Hodgson’s penalty with two from close range. Hodgson followed the prop Scott Wilson and the second-row Sean Robinson into the dressing room, leaving Newcastle without a specialist outside-half or goal-kicker.Ellis Genge was causing havoc in the scrums but Leicester failed to make possession and territory count and Newcastle went into the interval level when Juan Pablo Socino kicked a penalty in front of the posts. The Tigers wasted a driving maul at the start of the second period and then had a Ben Youngs ‘try’ ruled out for a knock-on.That did not seem to matter when Mike Fitzgerald scored from close range and Ford kicked his third penalty, but as Leicester made changes from the bench, some enforced, their dominance waned and Newcastle seized the moment. Goneva scored from a rare attack to reduce the home side’s lead to five points and the Falcons were not content with a bonus point.When Sione Kalamafoni was sent to the sin-bin three minutes from the end for lurking in an offside position and getting in the way, Newcastle launched a series of drives that ended with Hogg touching down on 80 minutes.As the try was reviewed, the TMO indicated to Pearce that he seemed to have blown his whistle before Hogg touched the ball down the second time with no camera angle confirming he had reached the line at the first attempt. “I definitely got the ball down the first time and not hearing the referee’s whistle made sure,” said Hogg.Richards hailed his side’s resilience, saying: “We struggled in the set-pieces: our scrum was awful and our line-out didn’t function but we stuck at it and the players showed great character. To win here was quite extraordinary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9eaa96c022547dd8ea4d687dc7cb2ea7d28b5d0/0_115_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553e2bd854cff66d603b48f512e51a37","title":"london marathon impostor accused of claiming runners medal","story":"Man pictured at finish with lost race number of charity runner who was removed from courseLondon Marathon organisers are investigating after it emerged that an apparent impostor may have used a genuine runner’s lost race number to collect a medal.Jake Halliday, 28, an investment manager from Edinburgh, reportedly lost his race number and was removed from the course three and a half hours into his run and about 15 minutes from the finish. Halliday was running with his friend Andrew Keiller for the blood cancer research charity Bloodwise, in support of Keiller’s girlfriend who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in October 2016. The pair – along with their friend Chris Chisholm who is due to run the Stirling marathon this weekend – have raised more than £48,500, smashing their £20,000 target. According to race tracking data, Halliday crossed the start line at 10.05am and reached the 40km mark in a little over three and a half hours, but did not record a finish time.Pictures have emerged apparently showing an alleged impostor posing at the finish line with Halliday’s race number, 35179, and a finisher’s medal.Officials said they were aware of the claims and were investigating but would make “no further comment at the moment”. According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he was not wearing a number, the Daily Mail reported. “It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It’s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it’s 12 months’ worth of training,” Mowbray wrote. “Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an impostor. The running world is very close-knit and when I saw the photograph of that man taking Jake’s medal I cried.”It is not the first time in the London Marathon’s 37-year-history that allegations of cheating have surfaced. In 2016, Natasha Argent, 26, agreed to return her finisher’s medal after she was found to have missed 11 of the 24 checkpoints. She was recorded as having completed the final 20km in 39mins – quicker than Sir Mo Farah. She later said she had had a panic attack and got lost.In 2010, a runner who was initially thought to have recorded the fastest London Marathon time by someone aged over 65 was found to have taken a 10-mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He said he had done so because of an injury.Donations to a fundraising page set up by a former MasterChef contestant who died after collapsing during this year’s marathon have topped £220,000. Matt Campbell, 29, from Kendal, collapsed at the 22.5-mile mark during Sunday’s event, which took place in record 24.1C (73.3F) temperatures.Campbell was running to raise a target of £2,500 for the Brathay Trust, which was where his father had worked before he died suddenly in 2016. By Friday afternoon, £217,500 had been raised through Campbell’s JustGiving page for the Cumbria-based charity, which works with vulnerable young people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a6f3091e6a2a1f60eb966efc005ee4b6b50a9d/247_133_761_456/master/761.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c1777aefce93ac00f8dbb8080c82711","title":"nothing like a dame judi dench maggie smith eileen atkins joan plowright","story":"Roger Michell’s film Nothing Like a Dame brings four legends together – and evokes decades of brilliant performancesSometimes the best ideas are the simplest. The wheeze of bringing together four of Britain’s distinguished theatrical dames – Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith – and letting them reminisce has yielded an extraordinary film which opens in cinemas next week before being shown on BBC TV under the Arena banner. Called, inevitably, Nothing Like a Dame, and directed by Roger Michell, it is both hilarious and, in its mix of present-day recollection and past footage, extremely touching. It also reminds me of the truth of David Hare’s observation that acting is ultimately “a judgment of character”.The four dames have known each other a long time and have much in common. Between them they have played all the great roles: Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, Saint Joan, the Duchess of Malfi. They have lived through radical changes in the approach to verse-speaking. And they have experienced the humdrum delights of theatrical digs: one legendary story involves an actor returning unexpectedly to pick up a script and discovering his landlady spreadeagled on the kitchen table with the milkman, only for her to shyly declare: “You must think me a terrible flirt.”Looking at the personalities, as well as the careers, of the four actors, what strikes me is their quirky iniduality: each has some essential, defining quality that makes for stardom. In the case of Maggie Smith, it is an acutely developed sense of irony that she has applied to the great high comedy roles such as Beatrice in Much Ado, Millamant in The Way of the World and Amanda in Private Lives. Her forte has always been a faint scepticism built on a fastidious use of language. You see it in the film when, as they discuss what it’s like to be a dame, Plowright observes that, as Lady Olivier, she has the difficulty of possessing a double title. “You’ll just have to grapple with it, Joan,” remarks Smith with wry coolness. But she can also pierce to the heart of a character. I’ve never forgotten how, when she played Titania at Stratford, Ontario, she made something inexpressibly moving out of the fairy queen’s grief at the death of her votaress in childbirth.Judi Dench is no less famous for conveying the contradictions within a character. Over the course of a long career, she has played just about everyone from the anguished heroine of John Hopkins’ TV drama Talking to a Stranger to Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria on the big screen. But although she was a magnificent Lady Macbeth and Cleopatra, what I admire most is her ability to catch the silvery contrasts of Shakespeare’s comic heroines. When Beatrice in Much Ado denies that she was born in a merry hour, Dench’s voice seemed to crack as she claimed: “No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born.” All of Dench’s capacity to mix bubbling mischief and plangent melancholy was caught in that line.For all her dual titles, Joan Plowright strikes me as the earthiest of the four dames. You see that in the film when she recalls someone telling her: “You’re no oil painting, but you’ve got the spark.” That spark was evident from the start in her sensational Beatie Bryant in Arnold Wesker’s Roots and her unforgettable Sonya in Olivier’s production of Uncle Vanya: her climactic speech to the broken-hearted Vanya, full of a defiant endurance, was one of the most moving things I’ve ever heard in a theatre.Eileen Atkins’s career encompasses everything from the classics to TS Eliot, Marguerite Duras and Samuel Beckett, and she is soon to return to the West End in Florian Zeller’s The Height of the Storm. If I had to single out any one performance, it would be her astonishing recent incarnation of Ellen Terry at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, in which she transported us in a second from Juliet’s terror to Lear’s thunder and from Rosalind’s lyrical ardour to Portia’s practical compassion. But Atkins’s defining gift is a no-bullshit emotional directness that, to borrow the words of James Agate on Jean Forbes-Robertson, I would describe as her “steel-true and blade-straight quality”.Watching Michell’s film is like eavesdropping on the freewheeling conversation of four old friends. At the same time, it unlocks our personal memories of past performances by four great actors and reminds us of their cherishable uniqueness.

The most vulnerable to the damage and suffering would be poor and older Americans, infants and children, and African Americans, who live in large numbers in urban areas where the heat island effect intensifies rising climactic temperatures.Almost eight out of 10 African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-burning plant, are three times more likely to die of airborne pollution than the overall population of the US, and black children suffer twice the levels of asthma with 10 times the level of asthmatic deaths, Gore said.The former vice-president to Bill Clinton, who famously won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but was defeated by George Bush on the electoral college count, launched an attack Scott Pruitt, the beleaguered administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for whittling down safeguards and regulations on air pollution. Pruitt is fighting to save his job having become engulfed in a raft of ethical controversies.Gore said of Pruitt: “I don’t know why he’s still in office, though I kind of do know.”He went on to accuse big business of leaning on Donald Trump to preserve Pruitt’s job. “The big grifters depend on the little grifter, and the big grifters have contacted the head grifter and said ‘Keep him in there’,” Gore said.The climate change advocate was speaking at a two-day summit organized by the Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights legal group in Montgomery. Under its director Bryan Stevenson, EJI has created a new museum and memorial that commemorates the victims of racial violence in the US and looks at the roots in slavery and segregation of the modern epidemic of mass incarceration.Gore called on his audience to remain hopeful that something could still be done to combat climate change in the US and beyond. He pointed out that the first occasion in which the US could legally withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change would be 4 November 2020 – a day after the 2020 US presidential election.“If there is a new president, there is a 30-day notice period to rejoin the agreement,” he said.Gore added that maybe it wouldn’t be that long before Trump left office. “We’re only a little over a year into this experiment and in science and medicine some experiments are terminated early for ethical reasons.”In his assessment, Trump had proved to be less capable of inflicting damage on the environment than he had feared, Gore said. “In the rush to do what the big polluters wanted him to do as quickly as possible they have made a lot of mistakes and the courts are striking down some of their actions. We have a lot of resilience built into the American system. They are doing damage for sure, but I believe much of it can be overturned.”Gore finished with an impassioned call for reforms to protect the US democratic system from the caustic influence of rich iniduals and corporations. “Out democracy was hacked long before Vladimir Putin hacked it, by big money and big lobbying. In order to solve the climate crisis we’ve got to fix the democracy crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fa7d20bd0609567ab76a8e41ae4b3319cbd19b4/0_188_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5c26098ff6c130e898df23c4f479e2","title":"bobby kennedy netflix documentary shines a light on his relevance","story":"Makers of Bobby Kennedy for President discuss the importance of reflecting on the politician’s legacy at this time in the USAs they drove through California in 1968, Bobby and Ethel Kennedy radiated warmth and cool, a young, hip image far removed from the tumultuous, politically charged era they lived in.That contrast returns again and again in the new Netflix documentary series Bobby Kennedy for President, which surveys the Democratic presidential nominee’s political and personal development.Kennedy was assassinated at 42 – shortly after one newscaster said of him, “No American in this century has ever been so likely to be president as Robert Francis Kennedy” – but the series does not emphasize the tragedy.Instead, the four-parter feels fresh as it ricochets between rarely seen archival footage and interviews with Kennedy contemporaries, who to this day are working to address the civil rights issues the Democrat sought to improve.Dawn Porter, the director and executive producer, told the  that “it’s not only fair, it’s imperative” to draw comparisons to now.“We are living at a time when people are questioning not just the actions of the current occupant of the White House, but they are also questioning the institutions: is the presidency that important?” Porter said. “Seeing the history, seeing what so many people have sacrificed to be good leaders, to do their best as leaders – we need to remember that, to remember that the office of the presidency, the national government is bigger than any one inidual.”Even without today’s parallels to the politically charged climate of 1968, the film would have a sense of now because of the film-makers’ stunning archival footage collection. The documentary team poured over 2,000 reels of film and digitized 240 hours of archive footage from news stations and personal collections to create the film.“You are so afraid you are going to miss something,” Porter said. “And you are going to miss things. There is no way to completely cover this rich period of history but we wanted to give it our best shot.”Amid depictions of the Democratic party in turmoil and the continued US involvement in Vietnam, the final episode offers a surprise with the questions it raises about the rushed case to prosecute Sirhan Sirhan, who is eventually charged with Kennedy’s murder.Witnesses to the attack are featured in archive footage and in the present to reiterate their skepticism about the investigation into Kennedy’s assassination and Sirhan’s trial. One of those witnesses is Sandra Serrano, who then and now said a woman in a white polka dot dress shot Kennedy.“They didn’t want to follow up on anything,” Serrano said in the documentary. “They wanted to wrap it up.”The film-makers also spoke extensively with Paul Schrade, Kennedy’s friend who was wounded in the shooting. He has spent decades trying to prove Sirhan’s innocence in Kennedy’s murder, but believes Sirhan shot him.This skepticism could rankle those frustrated by the conspiracies that still shadow John F Kennedy’s assassination, but ultimately the controversy takes a back seat to the legacy Kennedy left behind and the wounds left open by his death.Juan Romero, who had gone to shake Kennedy’s hand when the senator was shot, speaks in a rare, sobering interview towards the end of the series.Then a 17-year-old busboy, Romero attracted worldwide fame moments later when he cradled the dying president, a moment captured in Bill Eppridge’s famous photo of the assassination at the Ambassador hotel.Romeo rarely speaks about the incident, which demonstrably pains him to this day. He said in the moment Kennedy was shot “hope seemed to be dying with him. It just felt like nobody was there for us any more.”From the dozens of Kennedy associates who came forward to speak about the president, 50 years after his death, it’s clear his message resonated well past his death.Michalchyshyn was born in Canada a year before Kennedy’s assassination. Though her home country had its own glamorous legacy family with the Trudeaus, Michalchyshyn was well aware of the Kennedys. Her surface knowledge did not, however, prepare for the vigorous course in Bobby Kennedy and the 1960s.“It motivated me to get my American citizenship,” said Michalchyshyn. “The idea of public service, being involved, being part of the democracy. I am a fervent believer now in being a part of the democracy in this country. Working on this project has helped that for sure and motivated a lot of it.”Porter hopes that with this footage digitized, other film-makers will be able to explore the time period and perhaps create new works. “I don’t think we could ever have too much examination of our political history,” Porter said. “Kennedy was not an early enthusiastic civil rights advocate but he becomes that. Once that issue took hold of his heart, it didn’t die.

A band played “jolly music to heighten the welcoming atmosphere”, it said.In the Panmunjom document, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South’s president, Moon Jae-in, “confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula”.Leaders from around the world welcomed the summit outcome, but analaysts warned that previous displays of inter-Korean affection and pledges by the North have come to nothing.For years, Pyongyang insisted it would never give up the “treasured sword” of its nuclear arsenal, which it says it needs to defend itself against a possible US invasion.But it has offered to put it up for negotiation in exchange for security guarantees, according to Seoul – although Kim made no public reference to doing so at Friday’s spectacular summit.In a separate report, KCNA said the two leaders had a “candid and open-hearted exchange of views” on issues including “ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula and the denuclearisation of the peninsula”.The Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the mouthpiece of the North’s ruling Workers’ party, devoted the first four of its six pages to the event, carrying a total of 60 photos, 15 of them on page one.When Kim stepped over the military demarcation line that ides the peninsula he became the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean war hostilities ceased in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.He then persuaded Moon to step into the North – a fact reported by KCNA on Saturday – and the two leaders shared a day of smiles, intimate moments and a half-hour-long one-on-one conversation.The North has made rapid progress in its weapons programmes under Kim, detonating its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last year and launching missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, in moves that triggered increasingly strict UN security council sanctions against the regime.Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, traded personal insults and threats of war, sending tensions soaring before Moon seized on the Winter Olympics to broker dialogue, beginning a dizzying whirl of diplomacy that led to Friday’s meeting in the demilitarised zone between the two countries.Analysts and diplomats say that a combination of factors were behind Pyongyang’s change of heart, including feeling that it was in a position to negotiate from strength, the looming impact of sanctions and fear of potential US military action. But KCNA gave Kim the credit.“The historic meeting at Panmunjom came to be realised thanks to the supreme leader’s ardent love for the people and will for self-determination” independent of outside influence, it said.Washington is pressing Pyongyang to give up its weapons in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way, and analysts say that meaningful progress will depend on the outcome of Kim’s much-anticipated summit with Trump in the coming weeks.Trump hailed the Korea summit as historic, but warned “only time will tell”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960ded8e23b68ee882d43168ee67ee6a396d6319/0_392_5245_3149/master/5245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f9d7c464c5215d4e6102241cd46dcc7","title":"rare breed goat farming one of few jobs where women earn more than men","story":"Analysis shows women outearned men in only 107 occupations in 2015-16, compared with 1,072 where men earned more• Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Julie Cameron owns Victoria’s largest and most successful goat dairy, Meredith Dairy, with her husband Sandy.She does not earn markedly more than him. In fact, she says, they are careful to ensure that all their 130 employees receive equal work for equal pay.According to an analysis of the most recent Australian income-tax data, the Camerons are in the minority.Goat farming was one of the top 10 occupations in which women had a higher median taxable income than men in 2015-16, according to an analysis by  Australia. (The ABC previously conducted an analysis using average annual incomes, which returned slightly different results.)The only jobs where women outearned men to a greater extent were state governor, bulldozer operator, master fisher, sand blaster, conservation scientist, unspecified legal registrar, saw sharpener, trainee beauty therapist and fishing guide. But men outnumber women in all those occupations except conservation scientist (272 women to 149 men), unspecified legal registrar (five to four) and trainee beauty therapist (263 to six).Six female sand blasters outearned their 1,314 male counterparts by $23,762, taking home a median wage of $84,528 compared with $60,766 for the men.Four female bulldozer operators took home a median wage of $125,313, about $52,000 higher than the 440 men in the same position. Six female state governors, a category that accounts for its wide salary range by including other unspecified legislators such as Aboriginal land councillors, had a median income of $290,070. That was more than $200,000 higher than the median income of $89,495 earned by the 19 men in the same position. In the relevant year, three state and two territory governors were women.The 18 listed female goat farmers earned a median annual income of 40,983, about $11,000 higher than the 22 male goat farmers on $29,751.Women outearned men in 107 occupations, based on median annual income figures, while men earned more than women in 1,072 occupations. The wage gap favoured men most in surgical and specialist medical professions, where they outearned women in every field.Men earned between $160,000 and $337,000 more than women as: ear, nose, and throat surgeons diagnostic radiologists ophthalmologists radiologists plastic surgeons orthopaedic surgeons kidney specialists intensive care specialists pathologists and cardiologists.The remaining 22 Australian Taxation Office occupation categories did not contain enough people of each gender to make a comparison.They included porcelain turner (six men, no women) wood turner (50 men, no women) bungee jump master (six men, no women) and mothercraft nurse (201 women, no men).Cameron said it was possible that female goat farmers recorded a higher taxable income because they were more diligent about meeting the compliance requirements of what was a growing and heavily regulated industry.It could also be attributed to the age of the industry, she said.There has been something of a goat renaissance in Australia in the past 20 years – most large enterprises have been formed under modern workplace expectations.“Because it’s a new industry, it probably doesn’t come with the same baggage of an older industry with a traditionally male-dominated workforce,” Cameron said.Meredith Dairy runs 10,000 goats, of which about 6,000 are milked.About 1,600km north at Cranley Park near Clifton, Queensland, Peggy Jensen and her husband have a milking herd of about 1,800 goats.They acquired their first goat 40 years ago to provide milk for their son, Craig, and expanded it to a commercial venture.Jensen said she was not aware of goat farming becoming a female-dominated industry, but said it was a business that could be managed on a small property with only a few people, which made it more accessible.“They are small animals so they can easily be managed by women,” she said.Steven Baldock from the Dairy Goat Association of Australia has a much simpler answer.“I don’t know whether women get paid more than men – they’re probably just better goat farmers than men,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6c02be57a03e6be64e5fd20d8e3bc2dd91a43e2/0_0_3500_2354/master/3500.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eace8e05f9be14bb4f038f677a0c6e75 660w","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: Collins CourtsThe clinical director of the national cervical cancer screening programme advised a Limerick gynaecologist to file some audited test results rather than to tell women in certain cases that all-clear smear tests they had received years earlier were wrong.Dr Gráinne Flannelly, clinical director of CervicalCheck, told gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in an email in July 2017 that several women in the mid-west region should not be told about the false negative tests discovered in an audit after he wrote to her to confirm that she felt some women with cervical cancer should not be informed about them.The private correspondence was submitted in the High Court case taken by Vicky Phelan, a 43-year-old mother of two with terminal cancer from Annacotty, Co Limerick who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.The records emerged after Dr Flannelly publicly acknowledged that she could not say for sure that all of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer had been made aware of the situation.Dr Hickey wrote to Dr Flannelly on June 20th, 2017 referring to a list of patients with cervical cancer noting that in three highlighted cases the women should be told about the false smear test results after a 2014 review.“There were other ladies where the review process has altered the original smear report and it looks from your notes that you have felt that these should be filed in the patients’ notes and that no review is necessary,” Dr Hickey wrote to her at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street in Dublin.“I just wanted to confirm that you are happy with this whole process centrally from the Cervical Screening Unit given that it looks that some of the review smears were different from the original.”Dr Flannelly replied on July 7th, 2017 in an email with the subject line “clarification”.“Yes – a balance needs to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit. The possibility of resultant harm is crucial,” she wrote.In cases where women have not had cancer or who have “local and fertility-sparing surgery”, Dr Hickey should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical notes, Dr Flannelly wrote.“The concept of delay is important,” she said. “I based my judgment on the medical information available to me and using the same criteria I use in my own practice when dealing with these cases. Only three of the women merited a closeout meeting using these criteria,” Dr Flannelly wrote.On August 8th, 2017, after being told by Dr Hickey that he had taken it upon himself to inform all the affected women, Dr Flannelly wrote to him again, noting his decision and saying that this “underscores the value of the local clinician reviewing the clinical context”.“The advice I gave was based on the limited information available to me and was given as an honest assessment of what seemed to be the best way to proceed with these cases,” she said.“It is right and fitting that your own clinical judgment should take precedence.” Yesterday, Minister for Health Simon Harris appointed a senior team of experts to examine the cases of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer and to assess how many were not made aware of the delay in diagnosis.The appointments followed Mr Harris’s failure to declare confidence in the leadership of the programme. A HSE spokeswoman said Prof Flannelly would be “continuing in her role” and was “directly involved” in the process to provide assurance around the communications with the 206 women whose cases were under review.Asked about doctors using their “judgment” on whether to inform patients of wrong test results, the spokeswoman said the “practice was deemed to be appropriate and is in line with the practice in the UK for the communication of cancer audit reviews”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476929.1524858809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phelan case the days of doctor knows best are behind us","story":"Tánaiste Simon Coveney has apologised to Vicky Phelan and her family, the 43-year-old mother of two was incorrectly given the all-clear from a smear test taken in 2011.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky and Jim Phelan from Co Limerick: Ms Phelan wasn’t told of the false negative in her 2011 smear test until September 2017. Photograph: Collins Courts The case of Vicky Phelan, and subsequent news that more than 200 women diagnosed with cervical cancer should have received earlier interventions, have put a serious dent in public and ministerial confidence in the national cervical cancer screening programme.There is now a strong argument that the promised external review of CervicalCheck be extended to all health-screening programmes. The National Screening Service oversees BreastCheck, BowelScreen, CervicalCheck and the diabetic-retinopathy screening programme, which tests for early signs of eye damage associated with diabetes mellitus.Strangely, the National Screening Service came under the remit of the National Cancer Control Programme only relatively recently. It previously reported to a different section of the HSE. That the screening programme and the control programme were separate entities – a possible governance deficit – may have contributed to the events leading up to Ms Phelan’s High Court case and the dramatic revelations about CervicalCheck’s communication failures that followed it.There is no question mark about the clinical excellence of inidual programmes, but CervicalCheck’s former practice of not ensuring open disclosure for the women it invited for cancer screening means the public must be reassured that screening programmes for other diseases do not have similar loopholes.Modern healthcare must operate in an environment of full candour. The days of doctor knows best are firmly behind us. And previous thinking around ownership of medical notes has been replaced by a clear understanding that information about our health belongs, in the first instance, to each of us inidually.This means healthcare professionals informing patients, as soon as is practicable while in their care, of problems with test results, changes in diagnosis and any errors associated with their management.The principle of open disclosure was introduced almost two decades ago and is now accepted as a global norm. In practice it means doctors, nurses and hospitals must inform a patient of any untoward event. Most of these will not involve error but, rather, reflect the uncertain nature of healthcare and the known side effects of investigations and treatment. But patients must be informed promptly, as the adverse event is likely to influence a person’s future choice of treatment.So for CervicalCheck not to have a robust policy in place to manage events such as a look-back at previous smear results was a significant failure of governance. Such a policy would clearly identify how to ensure the patient and her doctor would receive simultaneous notification from the screening programme of a potential error. In order to limit any collateral damage to screening programmes for breast and bowel cancer, the promised review must examine their open-disclosure protocols as well. And although some observers have said a voluntary approach to open disclosure must be maintained, cold analysis suggests that particular horse has bolted.Irish healthcare, despite numerous scandals and promises to improve, is systemically incapable of making this important cultural change. Unlike some of his predecessors, Minister for Health Simon Harris must not shy away from his commitment to enshrine open disclosure in law."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dr Gr\u0026aacuteinne Flannelly told Limerick gynaecologist to file audited test results insteadHarris to sign regulations on voluntary open disclosure in health service by end of JuneFormer Ulster Farmers Union president elected as Sinn F\u0026eacutein backs Fine Gael candidateCrevan Mackin prescribed cocktail of drugs at time of Garda Tony Golden murderGroup to examine how CervicalCheck dealt with their cases and report back to HSESam Coulter-Smith calls for urgent review of outsourcing of Irish tests to US companiesEmployer group says Ministers must hold firm line on pay even if it means strikesDeceased who was in her in 70s was killed in incident near Boula, PortumnaPresident, who returns from visit to US on Saturday, says \u0026lsquoultimately\u0026rsquo the people will decideDirector general says sorry to Vicky Phelan for delay in being told about incorrect testParty will support Government\u0026rsquos proposition for abortion within first trimester\u0026lsquoI suspect getting away with crime isn\u0026rsquot one of his abilities,\u0026rsquo says judge\u0026lsquoLast thing I expected, God knows.

Photograph: @MaryLouMcDonaldPA WireA newly-elected Senator backed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he is willing to vote against the so-called “backstop” arrangement that would see Northern Ireland effectively remain under EU economic rules in a no-deal Brexit scenario.Ian Marshall, a former president of the Ulster Farmers Union, was elected to the Seanad yesterday in one of two byelections to the Upper House.Mr Marshall, from Markethill, Co Armagh, was approached by Mr Varadkar to stand as an Independent and topped the poll with the support of most of Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and Independents. Mr Marshall says he was born into an Ulster Unionist family but was never a member of a political party, instead focusing on farming politics.He will remain in his position in the Institute for Global Food Security in Queen’s University Belfast, while taking his Seanad seat.Describing himself as a “true democrat”, he said a second referendum on the terms of the British exit deal should be held. “It is not undemocratic to review the situation two years on,” he said.The underlying principle of the backstop – that Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK – is “not palatable”.“I am not comfortable with that. As a unionist, you couldn’t be comfortable with that.” He confirmed he would be prepared to vote against it if it came before the Seanad. Mr Marshall said the final Brexit deal must satisfy Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom generally, adding that “some hard questions” needed to be asked. However, Mr Marshall said the onus is on the British government to “come up with solutions”.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin’s backing for Mr Lawlor led to claims from Fianna Fáil that a potential coalition between Fine Gael and Mary Lou McDonald’s party is a real possibility. “When the chips are down, Leo Varadkar is happy to take the support of Sinn Féin and Sinn Féin is happy to give it,” Fianna Fáil Laois TD Seán Fleming said. “Their actions have spoken louder than words.”Carlow Kilkenny Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness, however, said the move “calls into question the current attitude towards Sinn Féin who are now major players when it comes to the formation of the next government”.Mr McGuinness said it should lead to a reassessment of Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin’s strategy of consistently saying Sinn Féin is unfit for office. Martin Heydon, the chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, insisted there will be no coalition with Sinn Féin. “Fianna Fáil is trying to deflect from its failure to secure either of the seats,” he said. “Fine Gael’s absolute rejection of any future deal with Sinn Féin has been clearly set out by the Taoiseach.” A Sinn Féin spokesman said Mr Martin’s “relentless criticism” of Sinn Féin meant made it difficult for its TDs and Senators – the electorate in a Seanad byelection – to support any Fianna Fáil candidates.“There was no way that Sinn Féin TDs or Senators were going to vote for an Fianna Fáil candidate given Micheál Martin’s relentless attacks on Sinn Féin. There is a definite resentment at Micheál Martin’s leadership.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476967.1524859267!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ross drink driving law efforts likely to pass through oireachtas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Transport Shane Ross: his Road Traffic Bill has met with strong opposition from rural politicians. Photograph: Eric LukeUnlike the Bill to reform the way judges are appointed, the efforts of Minister for Transport Shane Ross to change the State drink-driving laws are almost certain to pass through the Oireachtas. The vast majority of TDs in the Dáil are either supportive of its measures, or have decided not to oppose them, and the same is likely to be the case in the Seanad. The main thrust of the Road Traffic Bill is to increase penalties for those caught drink-driving. It will introduce a mandatory driving ban for a first drink-driving offence if a motorist has a blood alcohol level of above 50mg per 100ml. Currently, first-time offenders receive a fine and penalty points.It has met with strong opposition from rural politicians, and there were doubts at one stage if Fine Gael would even apply the whip to ensure Mr Ross’s proposals became law.Given the Government’s precarious minority, support was always needed from across the House. Sinn Féin’s decision to support the proposals almost from the moment they were announced by Mr Ross in early 2017 –allied with a Fine Gael whip – meant its passage was effectively secure from the outset. Labour and the Social Democrats are also providing support and Fianna Fáil this week announced that it would not oppose the Bill, despite being opposed to the severity of the sanctions within it.The main reason for the delay in its passing through the Oireachtas has been down to parliamentary procedure and management by the Government of the legislation.A group of rural deputies – the Healy-Raes, Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins, Michael Fitzmaurice and Seán Canney – are against the Bill, and some have been accused of filibustering during Dáil debates.Mr Canney, a member of Mr Ross’s Independent Alliance, provoked anger among his colleagues by voting against the Bill at report stage this week, rather than just abstain as he had earlier in the legislative process.The moves by the small group of deputies led Liz O’Donnell, the chair of the Road Safety Authority, to publicly criticise as “disgraceful and self-serving the behaviour and tactics employed by a tiny minority of rural TDs, who are delaying the passage of vital lifesaving road safety legislation”. The fact that Mr Ross has on a number of occasions expanded the Bill by adding amendments has, due to Dáil procedures, allowed the debate to be reopened by those TDs criticised by Ms O’Donnell.The latest is the “Clancy amendment”, which would penalise vehicle owners who allow a learner driver out on the road on their own and will allow gardaí to seize a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner driver. McGrath said it provided, once more, the opportunity to object. Against such opposition, governments would usually guillotine a Bill through but the current minority administration does not have the strength to do so.However, even McGrath expects the Bill to pass from the Dáil to the Seanad this week, and the Tipperary deputy accepts it will become law.“It is going to get through but is a ridiculous piece of legislation,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476951.1524857886!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unions optimistic of move to end two tier pay in public service","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShay Cody, joint general secretary of Fórsa trade union, arriving for pay talks at the Department of Finance on Friday. Photograph: Nick BradshawUnions are optimistic that the Government will agree to accelerate steps to end the two-tier pay system for newer entrants to the public service. Talks between public service unions and Government representatives on the issue of lower rates for some 60,000 staff recruited since January 2011 began yesterday. The Government has maintained that while it would review the two-tier system, funding to tackle the issue would not be available until after the current public service pay deal expires at the end of 2020. Earlier this month, the annual conferences of the three main teachers’ unions backed motions calling for potential strike action unless the Government committed by next month to address the issue. Arriving at the talks at the Department of Finance in Dublin, Shay Cody, joint general secretary of Fórsa trade union, said there were no assurances that the Government would shift its position. He said “the fact that we are talking gives grounds for some optimism that we can make some progress” but that the process could be technical and complicated.A source said the talks were looking at how rather than when the two additional points on the pay scale for staff recruited after January 2011 could be tackled. It is understood unions were taken through a report drawn up by the Department of Public Expenditure on the two-tier pay system.New figures presented at the talks suggested that ending this system would cost about €195 million – slightly less than the €200 million forecast previously.Teachers’ representatives signalled that abolishing the additional points of the pay scale would not mean the end of the pay discrepancy for their members as recent entrants also lost out on qualification allowances in place for more longer serving personnel, sources said. The Department of Public Expenditure said yesterday’s talks on the new entrant issue provided “an opportunity for a detailed exchange of views between the parties”. It said further talks were planned.Adrian Kane, a Siptu organiser, said the two sides had agreed to hold a further meeting on the issue of pay for public servants in June. “The period before that meeting will be used by both sides to establish the full extent of the issues which are to be discussed,” he said, adding that it was “imperative” that the two-tier pay issue be resolved in a timely manner. As the talks got under way, a group representing small and medium sized businesses said the Government must stand firm in the face of public service pay demands, even if it results in prolonged industrial action.Isme said “resisting unjustified public service pay demands is absolutely essential” and argued that public service staff in Ireland were among the best paid in Europe, already enjoying a large pay-premium over private sector workers.It said that if public service personnel “feel the grass is greener outside the public service, there are thousands of vacancies available for them to fill right now in the private sector”.“Ireland must not repeat the disaster that was benchmarking in 2002,” Isme chief executive Neil McDonnell said."},{"url":null,"title":"bertie ahern abruptly ends interview after being questioned on mahon tribunal","story":"  April 21, 2018Former taoiseach \u0026lsquohappy\u0026rsquo he cleared his name after allegations he received payments   April 22, 2018Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern Ireland "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476991.1524862165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins absolutely has the energy for a second term","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins at the UN headquarters in New York, where he said said the world’s turbulent countries can learn something from Ireland’s successful peace process.  Photograph: Mary AltafferAP PhotoMichael D Higgins has said he “absolutely” has the energy to take on a second term as President of Ireland and that it will ultimately be for the electorate to decide if he does so. Mr Higgins is on a visit to the US, during which he addressed the United Nations General Assembly on ways to end conflicts and said the world’s turbulent countries can learn something from Ireland’s successful peace process.While speaking to reporters at the Irish Consulate in Manhattan on Friday, Mr Higgins gave a strong indication that he will seek re-election.When asked if he had the energy for another seven years in Áras an Uachtaráin, he responded: “Absolutely.”“Have I the energy, have I the capacity to do so? I believe yes. But of course ultimately that’s for the people to decide,” he said. “And that suits me too as a campaigner all my life.”The President (77) has indicated that he will make a definitive statement on whether he intends to seek a second term by July with a presidential election expected to be held in the autumn. Asked about his his interest in remaining as President, Mr Higgins described his job as “fascinating”.Speaking earlier in the week in New York, Mr Higgins said his decision not to declare his intention to contest an election was not standing in the way of any potential rivals. “My decision will be my decision. I’m not standing in the way of anybody making a decision,” he said. He also said he had “never ran away from a contest in my life. Why should I?” The President’s week-long visit to the US will conclude on Saturday when he meets representatives of the Irish immigrant community in New York.He will cross the Hudson river to visit Rockland County GAA club before flying home with his wife, Sabina, on Saturday evening with Aer Lingus on what is the 60th anniversary of the airline’s first transatlantic service. A number of politicians have already said they wish to contest a presidential election.Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell claims to have the support of the 20 members of the Oireachtas required to get on the ballot paper for a presidential election.As the incumbent, Mr Higgins can nominate himself for a second term.Both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin have declined to comment until Mr Higgins makes his intentions known.Fine Gael Ministers Eoghan Murphy, Charlie Flanagan, Simon Harris and Richard Bruton this week told The  they would support a second term for Mr Higgins.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said her party will participate if there is a contest for the position.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3477002.1524862573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is winston churchtown spoiling for a bust up with mcdowell","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnybody But McDowell?: Shane Ross seems not to want Michael McDowell (above) to chair the Taoiseach’s committee to oversee the implementation of the Manning report on Seanad reform. Photograph Nick BradshawWhile Fine Gael is blue in the face trying to keep the Minister for Transport sweet, Winston Churchtown may yet be spoiling for another fight. The Independent Alliance’s senior man at the Cabinet table seems to revel in the might of his coalition power and ministerial veto.Churchtown, aka Shane Ross, has been testing the boundaries of his major Government partner’s patience since he was swept, along with his wildest dreams, into high office. Now Ross, it has been heavily rumoured for some time, has decided to stick his nose into Seanad business. Word from Government Buildings is that, not content with solo runs outside his own department in areas such as judicial appointments, Winston wants a say in who is appointed to chair the Taoiseach’s committee to oversee the implementation of the Manning report on Seanad reform. More to the point, he wants a say in who isn’t appointed.In February Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald asked the Taoiseach in the Dáil if Ross was blocking the appointment. Leo Varadkar waffled, saying the matter was still under consideration and he wasn’t even sure if it was his job to appoint a chair. At the same time, a Government source told The , “There is an impasse. There is a bad blood between Shane and Michael, and Shane is digging his heels in.’’Media requests in recent weeks for the name of the chairperson – the committee will have 26 members drawn from the Oireachtas and outside experts – have yielded nothing. This is all the more intriguing as the committee is supposed to be up and running by next Wednesday, when the political parties appoint their representatives to it, although they haven’t got around to picking any yet. The inauguration is expected to be postponed for at least a couple of weeks.Meanwhile, no word on a chair. Word has it that Winston Churchtown is still dead set against McDowell and might even be casting around privately for an alternative name. But neither Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil has changed its preference. Will Winston insist on having his way? The standoff is being watched with interest in both Houses. Time is running out.Because it concerns the upper house, people may have missed a significant moment in Irish political history on Friday. The once unthinkable became the politically acceptable. Two Fine Gael candidates cruised comfortably into Seanad seats – with critical byelection support from Sinn Féin. If they can do it once they can do it again. (Fianna Fáil will be singing that mantra as a general election nears.)Some may say it’s only the Seanad, which doesn’t really count. Nevertheless, when the votes were counted Sinn Féin ballots helped Ian Marshall, the former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, and Anthony Lawlor, the former Fine Gael TD for Kildare, over the line.Marshall was asked to contest the byelection by Varadkar, while Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy proposed Lawlor, an ally from his five-a-side backbench group during the last government and a likely general-election candidate.Marshall, a unionist and anti-Brexit campaigner, was always the front-runner, with strong support from the Government and Sinn Féin, anxious to burnish its inclusivity credentials.The second seat was harder to call, with the former Fianna Fáil TD for Donegal Niall Blaney the early favourite. According to one TD, this was partly because Blaney had indicated that he is not interested in running again for the Dáil and “wouldn’t have been a threat to anyone”.Sinn Féin weren’t buying that. The public line was that they are sick and tired of Fianna Fáil and Micheál Martin’s attacking them and in a two-horse race would vote for the least objectionable (Fine Gael) candidate. In reality they were never going to back a Blaney in Donegal and risk harming Pádraig Mac Lochlainn’s chances of regaining a Dáil seat there.In these days of tight margins the Seanad result tells us that when political expediency demands it, power beckons and the numbers are there, all sorts of strange alliances are possible.The Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane worked himself into a lather of righteous indignation in the chamber on Wednesday, thoroughly disgusted by the effrontery of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who disrespected Sinn Féin by not turning up for its Topical Issue motion on Brexit.Instead Simon Coveney sent along a minion from Co Clare by the name of Pat Breen, who is but a lowly Minister of State.Cullinane, who represents Waterford, stopped short of saying “Do you know who we are?” as he berated the absent Tánaiste for showing such disrespect to him and his colleagues Brian Stanley and Martin Kenny.The “Tropicals” are an important part of the Dáil day, when TDs get a chance to raise pressing issues of national or local concern with the relevant Minister. They submit topics, and the Ceann Comhairle selects four of them for debate. Senior Ministers, if at all possible, are expected to attend and deal with issues relating to their departmentsCullinane felt his party’s intention to talk about Brexit had been well flagged. “Yet there is no sign of the Minister with responsibility for this area. That is an absolute disgrace,” he said. “The Minister for Foreign Affairs should be here to hear the concerns of the three Sinn Féin Deputies on this issue, and he hasn’t bothered to turn up, for whatever reason.”As Cullinane thundered on, Stanley and Kenny sat beside him expressionless.“And if he wasn’t in a position to be here, then we should have been informed of that, which is the rule under Standing Orders.”Oh, but he was fuming.“So I want to protest in the strongest possible terms, given the gravity of these issues, that the Minister himself is not here.”“Hear! Hear!” Stanley and Kenny roared.Actually, they didn’t. There was a marked lack of solidarity. Neither said a word. They didn’t look at their outraged colleague, who concluded his rant with a conciliatory “No disrespect to the minister who is sitting across from me.”Breen didn’t look too bothered, despite Cullinane’s relegating him to the role of the organ grinder’s monkey.And where was Simon Coveney? He was in Derry, discussing Brexit with business and political leaders. Among the people he met at a luncheon hosted by the chamber of commerce was Elisha McCallion, Sinn Féin MP for the Foyle constituency. As part of his trip the Tánaiste also visited the Londonderry Bands Forum and the Bloody Sunday museum.Coveney told the Belfast  he met a broad section of business and regional representatives at the chamber event. “It was a really useful opportunity to update members of the chamber on progress in the EU-UK negotiations and to outline the Government’s key priorities in that process.”On Wednesday morning, in accordance with Standing Orders, the Minister’s staff contacted the offices of two of the three Sinn Féin TDs to say he couldn’t take their Brexit-related Topical Issue because of his Brexit-related commitments in Derry. They couldn’t get through to Cullinane’s office.Kenny and Stanley mustn’t have passed on the message, hence the subdued reaction to their fired-up colleague’s shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later approach to Coveney’s absence.Sometimes the Dáil feels like just one elaborate vehicle for the Michael and Danny Healy-Rae show. The Kerry politicians are expert self-publicists, while wailing that rural TDs like themselves are ignored in parliament and ballyragged by the Dublin meeja. They complain about being ridiculed and stereotyped, then mark their arrival for the first session of the Dáil by step-dancing on the bonnet of a mucky jeep outside Leinster House. Michael Healy-Rae has even secured a special dispensation from Oireachtas authorities to wear his trademark cap in the chamber.It must be difficult for TDs who have to share the constituency with them.Minister of State Brendan Griffin, who is from Castlemaine, had a pop at Michael Healy-Rae on social media this week. He was annoyed by a big piece in the local newspaper that had Healy-Rae claiming responsibility for the reintroduction of the local-improvement scheme, or LIS, for roads all over the country “€725,000 roads fund due to my work” was the headline, alongside a photograph of the triumphant TD.Griffin tweeted a picture of a cartoon rooster crowing at sunrise alongside a screenshot of the article. “MHealyRae like the rooster who thinks the sun comes up because of him.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476904.1524855004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"six decades on a ray of light reaches franco s resting place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLawyer Eduardo Ranz, with  family members of Spanish Civil War victims who want their dead relatives exhumed, at the entrance of the Basilica of the Valley of the Fallen. Photograph: Juan MedinaThe monument known as the Valley of the Fallen, containing the body of the dictator Francisco Franco, has barely been touched since its completion in 1959. But that may be about to change.Last Monday, a group of relatives of men who were also buried at the site gathered at its entrance amid a swarm of TV cameras and photographers. These people have registered requests for the bodies of their loved ones to be dug up in order to be given a decent burial elsewhere.A team of experts entered the site and carried out preliminary checks to see if a search for the bodies in question is feasible.Eduardo Ranz, the young lawyer representing the families, described it as a historic day.“It’s the biggest mass grave in Spain, ” he told The . “This place is outside the bounds of democracy.”Situated in a wooded area 60km north of Madrid, the Valley of the Fallen is Spain’s biggest and most controversial reminder of its 1936-1939 civil war and the four-decade dictatorship that followed. Its construction began after the war ended and republican prisoners who had fought against Franco were used to build it.The monument’s centrepiece is a 150m-high stone cross. Beneath it is a basilica, drilled deep into the mountainside at the end of which lies the tomb of Franco, who died in 1975, just a few steps away from the main altar.On either side of the tomb, the remains of 33,700 people killed in the civil war lie grouped together in boxes in underground crypts, most of them unidentified. It is from these crypts that those gathered on Monday want to find and exhume their relatives.For Rosa Gil, the granddaughter of one of those buried there, the opening-up of the basilica to the team of experts was “a day of hope and happiness”.Her grandfather, Pedro Gil Calonge, died in 1937 in northern Spain, fighting for Franco. But his remains were exhumed from a cemetery in Zaragoza in the early 1960s and transferred to the Valley of the Fallen without his family being informed, as part of an initiative to make the site a cemetery for victims of the civil war.Rosa says that when her father, Silvino Gil, who had been a pro-Franco politician, found out the truth a few years ago, he said: “Why should Franco be able to move my father’s body?”The families of eight men whose bodies were moved to the Valley of the Fallen are now hoping to get them exhumed, although initially only four are being searched for. The fact that the eight are from both sides of the civil war – six were leftist republicans and two fought for Franco’s right-wing nationalists – reflects the potentially groundbreaking nature of this case.It was put in motion in May of 2016, when a court authorised the exhumation from the Valley of the Fallen of two republican brothers, Manuel and Antonio Ramiro Lapeña, at the request of the former’s granddaughter. Other requests followed.However, the prior of the Benedictine monastery at the Valley of the Fallen, Santiago Cantera, refused to open the crypt, blocking the procedure. The families hoping to exhume their relatives filed a legal complaint against Cantera for disobeying a court order. The standoff was resolved last month, when Archbishop Ricardo Blázquez, chairman of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, stepped in.The legacy of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship has long been a thorny issue. In 2007, the then-Socialist government introduced a historical memory law, which included the removal of public symbols of Franco and his regime. But although statues of the dictator and street signs bearing his name and those of his officials were taken down, many symbols remain and no steps were taken with regard to the Valley of the Fallen, which is today visited by tourists and Franco nostalgists.The bodies of over 100,000 victims of Franco from the war and its aftermath lie in unmarked graves across Spain and volunteers who identify and exhume them do not receive state funding.The issue tends to ide Spaniards along political lines, with those on the left more inclined to favour tackling the historical memory issue and those on the right often warning such an approach risks reopening old wounds.It is still early days and the forensic experts might yet decide that locating the bodies in the Valley of the Fallen will be too difficult. The lawyer, Eduardo Ranz, urged caution, but said he and his clients are prepared to wait.“The work will be completed when the families can give their loved ones a dignified burial,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts.

Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids’ eyes and ears. A few went out to get a staff member but she was overwhelmed and didn’t really know what to do.

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ben Widdicombe visited the Marvel Comics creator at his home and heard him declare: ‘Nobody has more freedom’Stan Lee, the Marvel Comics maestro and co-creator of Spider-Man, X-Men and Black Panther, lives in a world of heroes and villains. But these days, it can be hard to tell which is which.Few creators have left as profound a mark on popular culture. According to The-Numbers, a box office data site, films featuring Lee’s superheroes have grossed more than $24bn (£17.2bn) worldwide. He has a huge Twitter following, and admirers have included Federico Fellini, Ronald Reagan and George RR Martin, the author of Game of Thrones.“Stan is right up there with Walt Disney as one of the great creators of not just one character, but a whole galaxy of characters that have become part of our lives,” Martin said. “Right now, I think he’s probably bigger than Disney.”Stan Lee\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War cameo might be his funniest yetYet at the summit of Lee’s career, storm clouds have gathered.The last year has brought an unsettling mix of tragedy and scandal, including the death in July of Joan Lee, his wife of almost 70 years suspicions that millions of dollars have been siphoned from his accounts even gossip reports that a former business associate stole his blood to sell to fans.Lee with his late wife Joan in 2011. Since she died last year the household has been thrown into disarray (Getty)Earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter published an investigation that said Lee, 95, is the victim of “elder abuse”, partly at the hands of his 67-year-old daughter, Joan Celia Lee. The Daily Beast reported in March that Lee, who is said to be worth around $50m, was “surrounded by a panoply of Hollywood charlatans and mountebanks” and being “picked apart by vultures”.A radio talk show in Orlando, Florida, even aired a rumour that he is being “held captive” by handlers who “have him basically locked up in the house”.But on a recent visit to Lee’s home in the Bird Streets, a celebrity enclave high in the hills of West Hollywood, California, the man himself said otherwise.True, a 6ft 4in security guard, with a pistol on his hip, opened the front gate. And Lee hasn’t been getting out as much since a bout of pneumonia left him short of breath and looking frail. He also can no longer read because of macular degeneration.Lee pictured in New York in 1978: ‘Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me’ (Getty)Despite all that, Lee seemed relaxed and enthusiastic. Wearing a yellow shirt and beige polyester slacks in his poolside sitting room, its Sherwood-green carpet bleached by 40 years of California sunshine, he welcomed a reporter into his home.So, is he a prisoner in his own house, surrounded by real-life supervillains?“I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” Lee said, chuckling and sounding like a 95-year-old teenager. “Nobody has more freedom.”He also defended his daughter, known as JC, against claims that she has been physically abusive and a financial drain. “My daughter has been a great help to me,” he said. “Life is pretty good.”A house in disarrayFor four decades, Lee has lived in a relatively modest two-storey house in the middle of what has become some of Los Angeles’ most valuable real estate. DrDre is a neighbour, and Leonardo DiCaprio lives down the block, on a street where houses can list for north of $30m.Inside the suburban-style home, a nurse and a maid bustled in the kitchen. Although Lee seemed at ease, the armed guard lent an air of surveillance that made it difficult to entirely relax.The house is a time capsule of late 1970s Hollywood. Decorated by his late wife, it is dotted with ceramic animals, carved figures in African and Asian styles, and large gilt-framed mirrors hung on mirrored walls. Empty hooks surrounded by dusty outlines sit amid prints and original works by noted artists – Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Salvador Dali and Roy Lichtenstein – suggesting a home being slowly eroded.“My wife, she’s the only person in the world that I would know of who would put a big mirror on top of a big mirror,” Lee said. “And when she was here, she had so many paintings, all over. Most of them have left now. My daughter took a lot of them, and a lot of them have gone elsewhere.”It’s the vagueness about what has “gone elsewhere” that has some of Lee’s friends so worried.Since Lee’s wife died last year, his household has been thrown into disarray, with three factions of once-trusted aides vying for control. Lee’s current gatekeeper is Keya Morgan, who has ousted former staff.Producer Keya Morgan and Joan C Lee – are they real-life supervillains holding Lee hostage? (Getty)A former memorabilia dealer from New York, Morgan moved to Los Angeles as the executive producer of the mobster biopic Gotti and now describes himself as a “producing partner of John Travolta”. Sitting at Lee’s side, he was dressed in a black suit and tie, black bowler hat and dark sunglasses, which he lowered on his nose to see indoors.In February, Morgan called police to the house to physically remove Lee’s longtime road manager, Mac Anderson, known as Max. Anderson was accused of, among other things, attempting to bribe a nurse to make statements that Lee was being held hostage. “He got into a big fight with Stan and Stan’s daughter” and was fired soon afterward, Morgan said.Reached by phone, Anderson declined to comment.Also out was Jerry Olivarez, a Hollywood publicist who briefly obtained power of attorney over Lee’s affairs last year, during which time more than $1m left the Marvel creator’s accounts. That included a $300,000 cheque made out to Hands of Respect, a novelty company owned by Olivarez and Lee that makes a $10 lapel pin advocating racial harmony.In unrelated matters, $1.4m may have vanished in a series of wire transfers, and a Chanel handbag full of cash may be missing from the house, according to Morgan. Also, a trove of Marvel memorabilia, including character sketches and figurines, is the subject of disputed ownership between Anderson and Lee, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.Lee may be a creative genius, but he isn’t a financial one. “I’ve been very careless with money,” he said.“I had a partner or two who – since I’m not a money counter – I let them take care of keeping track of the money we made,” Lee said, as he sipped a bottle of mineral water to soothe his raspy voice. “Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me. I don’t know where it is, but a guy, and maybe one or two others, have found a way to take it.“So, I feel bad about it, and of course we have a lawyer trying to get it back again,” he said. “But money isn’t worth losing your cool about, you know.”The child of Romanian Jewish immigrants, Stanley Lieber was born in New York City in 1922. He was hired in 1939 as an assistant at Timely Comics, the not-especially-promising ision of a pulp magazine publisher that would eventually be renamed Marvel.Following a staff exodus the next year, the newly rechristened Lee (an alias he adopted to save his real name for the great novels he aspired to write) was appointed its editor. The two great motifs of his life were established: a nagging feeling that his work in comics was cultural schlock and the fact that he would be a lifelong corporate employee, never owning the rights to his creations.His greatest streak of inspiration began in 1961, when Lee was almost 40 and thoroughly disenchanted with his career. With artist Jack Kirby, he created the Fantastic Four, a hit he bested the next year by inventing Spider-Man with artist Steve Ditko.Among the enduring characters he created over the next decade with those artists, and others, are the X-Men, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange and, in 1966, Black Panther: an African warrior-king whose recent film adventure has grossed more than $1.3bn.“I’m sorry I didn’t introduce black characters a little sooner,” Lee said. “I tried to create an Asian superhero, I tried to create a South American superhero. And at that point I also was thinking it’s ridiculous that we don’t have a black superhero.”Asked if contemporary comics and films could be doing a better job of representing women and superheroes of colour, he replied, “yes”, but expanded: “You can’t force anything on the public. But if you do a black hero or heroine and you see that it’s well-received at the newsstand, then you’d be an idiot not to come up with more stories like that.

While he has made exponentially more money than any of his Marvel co-creators, he only ever collected a salary, and does not receive any continuing royalties from the films based on his characters.In 2005, he received a one-time payment of $10m from Marvel, to settle a provision in his contract that had entitled him to 10 per cent of the profits from television and film adaptations. Four years later, Disney bought Marvel for $4bn it is unclear whether Lee was able to reap any benefit. (As Marvel’s chairman emeritus, he still receives a salary, reported to be $1m.)And while his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) are a lucrative source of income, later-life attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties have foundered.Stan Lee Media, a digital content startup, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F Paul, in prison for securities fraud. And Lee is embroiled in disputes with POW! Entertainment, the company he started in 2001 to create new shows, including Stripperella, a cartoon animation starring Pamela Anderson.POW! was sold last year to Camsing International, a Hong Kong-based company seeking to clone Marvel for the Asian market. Lee says he has not been paid, which the company denies. “Mr Lee has been paid and continues to be paid by the company,” said Shane Duffy, the chief executive of POW! “Statements like this only heighten our concern for Stan’s wellbeing.”Lee and actor Chadwick Boseman at the LA world premiere of ‘Black Panther’ in January (Getty)As part of the escalating fight, Morgan and Lee’s daughter entered the POW! offices on Santa Monica Boulevard on the night of 14 March and removed items they say belong to Lee. They triggered a silent alarm, prompting POW! to file a police report.The Beverly Hills police subsequently dropped the burglary investigation, but the fighting continues. “They’re acting as if they bought the company and everything on the four walls belong to them,” said Lee, sounding downcast. “So, another lawsuit.”An Oscar for Stan Lee?Outside the bubble of legal drama and personal strife, however, Lee’s creative influence remains at an all-time high.“There’s no doubt that Stan, in terms of American popular culture, he’s one of the giants of the 20th century,” Martin said. “Spider-Man and Iron Man the X-Men – they’re still as viable as ever.”From the floral sofa in his sitting room, Lee is a font of highly entertaining stories from the glory days, even if some of them sound taller than his 1962 creation Giant-Man.Like the time Picasso was so taken by Joan Lee’s beauty that he approached the couple in a New York restaurant and sketched her on their tablecloth. “We ran home to tell my father about what happened,” Lee said. But, “in our excitement, we had left the drawing in the restaurant. We never found it!”Stan Lee turns 94: His 25 best cameos in Marvel filmsStan Lee has already filmed cameos for four more Marvel moviesStan Lee has only good things to say about Tom Holland\u0027s Spider-ManOr the time when DiCaprio told Lee that he had written to the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, lobbying for Lee to receive an honorary Oscar for his numerous cameos over the years. (Lee appears in nearly every Marvel movie, including Black Panther, in which he plays a gambler in a South Korean casino.)DiCaprio also wants to portray Lee in a film about the Marvel creator, according to Morgan, who accompanied Lee on a recent visit to DiCaprio’s house. (A spokesman for DiCaprio would not confirm this account of their conversation.)The thought of a biopic starring DiCaprio gave Lee pause. He looked out over the pool, to the canyon beyond, and pondered being portrayed by an Oscar-winning actor.“I don’t know if he could capture the essence of me,” he said, after a moment. “We have to talk about that.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But this will not work. The UK has decided to withdraw from the Union. It wants to be sovereign and be able to set its own rulebook, to have its own supervision and enforcement system.“In doing so, the UK will move away from EU rules. It will not accept common EU supervision and enforcement tools. These are precisely the essential building blocks of our post-crisis financial regulation. They ensure that the internal market can exist and function correctly.‘Everything must change so that everything can stay the same’, to paraphrase Lampedusa. But this will not work.“The EU understands that the UK does not want to become a \u0027rule-taker\u0027. But the UK also needs to understand that the EU cannot accept mutual market access without the common safeguards that underpin it.”Mr Barnier added that relying on Britain to regulate services sold into EU markets was “not something that any country in the world would accept”. He described Brexit as “a lose-lose situation”, telling his audience: “I do not see added value in Brexit and so far, nobody has shown us any.”“Outside of the customs union and the single market, there can be no frictionless trade. Businesses will be faced with non-tariff barriers and border checks that do not exist today,” the chief negotiator warned.Allowing British firms to sell services into the EU is crucial for the UK because around 80 per cent of the British economy comes from providing services, with about 43 per cent of British exports heading to the EU in 2016. The Government has said it want any trade deal with the EU to cover services.Speaking at the same event Mr Barnier said the cost of Brexit “will be substantially higher for the UK than for the EU”, noting that in terms of “trade dependency” the EU27 accounts for around 50 per cent of UK export and imports, while the UK market accounts for 7 per cent of EU exports and 4 per cent of imports. Theresa May has asked for the EU and UK to mutually recognise each others\u0027 rules and regulations as adequate (AP)The Brussels Brexit chief also brushed away claims by British commentators that European businesses desperately needs the City of London for finance. He cited research by the European Central Bank that any problem caused by losing access to London\u0027s banks appears limited and said the claim was not what we hear from market participants, and is not the analysis that we have made ourselves.In her Mansion House speech last month Ms May called for a “comprehensive system of mutual recognition” where both blocs pledged to keep their regulations equivalent to one another to facilitate trade. She said that under such a system “UK law may not necessarily be identical to EU law, but it should achieve the same outcomes”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

In his capacity as head of the CIA, Mr Pompeo travelled to North Korea to lay the groundwork for the high-stakes summit.While Mr Trump has heralded the opportunity for a deal to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, both Mr Bolton and Mr Pompeo have evinced scepticism about the sincerity of North Korea’s motives.In addition to helping prepare the North Korea summit, Mr Pompeo will help the White House navigate a crucial and fast-approaching deadline for the Iran nuclear deal.Mr Trump must decide by mid-May whether to continue lifting sanctions on Iran, as dictated by the pact. Both the president and Mr Pompeo have heaped disdain on the agreement, and Mr Trump said in January that he was agreeing to waive some sanctions “only in order to secure our European allies’ agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal”.“This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal”, Mr Trump said at the time.During a visit to Washington this week, French president Emmanuel Macron worked to persuade Donald Trump to preserve the deal. But Mr Macron conceded he faced slim odds of succeeding.“My view – I don’t know what your president will decide – is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,” Mr Macron told reporters.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

What are the benefits\u0026nbspand can it really work?What is universal basic income?Universal basic income (UBI) is a welfare programme in which all citizens receive an unconditional sum of money from the government.\u0026nbspIt is hailed as a progressive system and its proponents include billionaires\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Richard Branson.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhy is Finland trialing universal basic income?The experiment was launched in\u0026nbspJanuary 2017 and 2,000 participants have been receiving a €560 (£490) monthly basic income payment, which is independent of any other income they may have and not conditional on undertaking an active search for employment.Researchers will\u0026nbspstudy the effect of increasing cash incentives for work and simplifying the social security system on the employment rate of the study participants.The Finnish centre-right government is austerity focused but is looking to reduce the country’s 8.5 per cent unemployment rate. This trial is being viewed as a method of doing just that.\u0026nbspSupporters of a basic income argue it would help get unemployed people into temporary jobs, rather than forcing them to remain unemployed to qualify for benefits.They say it would provide a safety net, address insecurities associated with workers not having full-time staff contracts, and help boost mobility in the labour market as people would have a source of income between jobs.The study will also look at the well-being of the participants and their experiences when communicating and conducting business with the authorities.Did the trial fail?The quick answer is no. There were a number of reports that the experiment had fallen flat because it had proven to be too costly, but Finland says this is not the case.\u0026nbsp“The experiment is proceeding according to plan and will continue until the end of 2018,”\u0026nbspProfessor\u0026nbspOlli Kangas, the leader of the research team at Kela (Social Insurance Institution of Finland), said.How the trial is going so far is unknown and the employment effects across the whole experiment will not be available until the end of 2019 or at the beginning of 2020.“The effects of the experiment will not be published while the experiment is in progress, because a public discussion of the results could influence the behaviour of the test and control groups. That would lead to skewed results,”\u0026nbspMr Kangas said.What next for Finland\u0027s experiment?The experiment will run through until the end of the year after which a detailed study will be released.\u0026nbspIt will compare the group of 2,000 who received UBI\u0026nbspwith a control group of about 173,000, who are made up of people included in the target population but not included in the study.\u0026nbspOne of the primary objectives is to see if\u0026nbspthere are differences in employment rates between those receiving and those not receiving a basic income.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

People will then rightly ask in what way we have left the EU. This debate is simply an attempt to frustrate Brexit and undermine the referendum result.\u0026ldquoIf we do not leave the Customs Union, there is no point in leaving the EU. Being \u0026lsquoout\u0026rsquo of the EU but having to abide by its tariffs and being unable to strike new trade deals with the rest of the world defies logic.\u0026ldquoThe North of England economy is worth over \u0026pound300bn and makes up 19 per cent of total UK output, but it has the potential to be so much more after Brexit, as long as we leave the Customs Union.\u0026ldquoWith 90 per cent of global growth over the next 10-15 years set to be from non-EU countries, it makes no sense to lock ourselves out of these lucrative markets.\u0026ldquoPolicy North has proposed establishing free ports in the North post Brexit. There are currently no functional Free Trade Zones in the UK because membership of the Single Market and Customs Union effectively prevents us from creating them.

showdown over the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill because she fears a humiliating defeat.Government data indicates the decision to rule out a new customs union with the European Union could cost the UK economy \u0026pound24 billion by 2033.Sir Keir said: Over the past few weeks it has become abundantly clear that Theresa May is unwilling and unable to put the country\u0027s interests first during the Brexit negotiations.She has wasted 12 weeks of the Brexit negotiations delaying a Commons vote on the UK negotiating a customs union with the EU for fear of a defeat.In light of the Government\u0027s own impact assessments and the lack of progress on any new trade deals, any economic case for ruling out a customs union has collapsed.The Prime Minister is now solely focused on internal party management and masking the isions within her government.But Brexit minister Suella Braverman said Labour\u0027s support for a customs union would leave the UK shackled to Brussels, taking rules set by the EU and unable to strike trade deals.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed a customs union but only if the UK had a say in future EU trade deals.Mrs Braverman said: The supposed safeguards that Corbyn talks about are impossible to achieve and will get laughed out of town.She said Labour was more interested in frustrating the process and playing politics than they are in delivering a successful Brexit.Labour Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper and Treasury select committee chairwoman Ms Morgan said in a joint statement: We both believe the case for a

It said there were 12,503 enforced returns in 2016-17, which was considered a \u0026ldquosuccess given the particularly damaging impact from the number of late claims for asylum.The memo goes on: \u0026ldquoIE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area.\u0026nbspThe memo then turns to \u0026ldquoassisted returns which covers cases such as those where an inidual has left the country voluntarily on a flight paid for by the British Government.\u0026ldquoTypically these will be our most vulnerable returnees.

By 9am on April 29, Scotland will have seen a sprinkling of the white stuff after it moves down from the north coast.By the next day, snow is predicted to hit the North Pennines in northern England and southern Scotland.And by Monday temperatures will drop far enough for snow to fall on high ground over the North and South Downs.The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Eastern and Southeastern England for heavy rain and flooding on April 29.Meteorologists are forecasting downpours of up to 70mm in places accompanied by strong to gale force Northerly winds, while homes and businesses have been put on guard for risk of flooding.But the sunny weather is expected to return later in May bringing the temperatures back above average for the time of year.Thursday April 19 was the hottest day in April since 1949.It was the warmest day of 2018 so far with highs of 29C.Forecasters are predicting a hotter than average June, July and August.The Weather Channel’s Leon Brown said: Glorious blue skies and 30C are expected by June thanks to warm air flowing from the continent.Last weeks heatwave saw the 2018 London Marathon as the hottest on record with 40,000 runners battling 24C temperatures.Bookmaker Coral has even slashed the odds on this month to be the hottest April ever.Another mini-heatwave is sweeping across with 23C forecast just in time for the May Bank Holiday.In contrast to the loathed Beast from the East, the Beauty from the East will see a high pressure front, bringing warmer air from the east to the west.Brian Gaze from Weather Outlook said: We could see temperatures picking back up from the Bank Holiday weekend, in the second week of May.Theres a chance of high pressure blowing over continental Europe, that could lead to warm air settling in the South East of England.My view is that its possible that we could see temperatures of up to 23C, with the warmer spell lasting between three to five days.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5 °C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just look around you. We’ve had one for a while.And now the Government is trying to do something about it.Trouble is, it’s doing completely the WRONG thing.Acting on the advice of campaigners such as Jamie Oliver it plans to start clamping down on what it calls junk food.Under the proposals, buy one, get one free deals will be outlawed.That will make food a lot dearer for the poorest of us.Officials   may also extend the levy on sugary drinks. That will do the same thing.Another name for junk food is: “stuff middle class people don’t like very much”.And that’s the point. These nanny state initiatives always hurt the working class, not the middle classes.When they tried to stop us getting drunk all the time, they whacked a levy on cheap cider — not a bottle of Chablis.And yet alcoholism is just as bad within the better-off classes — just not as heavily reported.And now they’ve turned their attention to supposed junk food.But putting up the prices simply makes it harder for poor people to make ends meet.They are already suffering through low wages, partly the consequence of uncontrolled immigration.People, no matter how poor they are, know that it is not good to eat pizza every night of the week.Not many people do so. But the truth is that the food we eat today is no more fattening than the food we ate back in the 1970s, when everybody was as thin as a dieting whippet on Benzedrine.The real problem is a lack of exercise.People don’t get out any more. They don’t walk.They stay in their homes or drive their cars.Not so long ago the health lobbyists announced that everyone should do 40 minutes of walking per day because the results are so beneficial.But they had to reduce it to 20 minutes because everyone thought 40 minutes was way too onerous.A bit more education in our schools about the benefits of exercise wouldn’t go amiss.“Start Walking Or You’ll Die” would be a decent slogan.Might capture the interest.At the same time the health lobbyists also oppose what they call “fat-shaming”. And yet “fat-shaming” is a free, non-governmental means of persuading fat people not to be fat.I put on weight a few years back and it was only when my teenage son, in an argument, called me “a fat lardy-faced tosser” that I thought I ought to do something about it.Fat-shaming, you see — it works. If ­people think it’s OK to be fat they will stay fat.But leave our food alone. Don’t price the poorest of us out of the treats we all enjoy once in a while. And now I’m off for a walk because some of that weight has come back.How do I know? I told my wife I had a cut on my chin.And she looked at me and said: “Which one?”A GOVERNMENT ­scientist has been sacked for insulting his ­colleagues. He called one of them a “lardarse” and another a “f**kwit”.One bloke was the “Monster From Zagreb” while he was accused of calling another ­simply a “c**ksucker”. Top abuse! And I bet he had a point. The authorities wittered on about how he contravened their policies on bullying.Oh, spare us. If you can’t abuse your work ­colleagues, what fun is there in life?Another alleged insult was “vinegar t*ts”. I don’t know what it means, but I’m going to use it at every available opportunity.THERE are people out there who can show you racism in a handful of dust. They can ­conjure it up out of the air.They are usually idiots. Take the singer Raye, (nope, me neither) for example. She’s claimed a restaurant in London was “racist”.Her male friend, who is black, was refused entrance because of what he was wearing. Shorts and trainers.Listen love, that isn’t racism. That’s called a dress code. You want to eat in a posh restaurant? Then don’t dress like a toddler on his first trip to a paddling pool.Then there’s the BBC Proms. It’s in trouble for ­having cast a white woman to play the part of Maria in West Side Story.Maria is usually ­Hispanic. But if it’s OK to have a black actor playing ­Hamlet, why isn’t it OK to have a white woman ­playing Maria?The poor bloody actress, Sierra Boggess, has even been forced to apologise for having taken the part.And she’s pulled out.This shrieking obsession with race is divisive and stupid.This is to reflect the state’s “cultural ­identity”.If only the same thing would happen here . . . but don’t hold yer breath.THE Windrush fiasco has been hurtful to a generation of Caribbean people who came here, at our invitation, back between the 1940s and 1970s.It’s a genuine scandal. But look how the Lefties are trying to turn it into an assault on our immigration policies.Saying we must be less “hostile” to immigrants coming here now. Opening the borders.But the British public – including a majority of immigrants – still think there is far too much immigration to this country.And we are right to try to impose controls.As ever, never listen to the liberals.BRITISH students taking A levels were deeply confused by a mysterious object in the examination hall.It was circular, with numbers around the outside, and three hands pointing at the numbers. Teachers tried to explain to them: “It’s called a clock. You can tell the time by it. It will show you how long you have to go on your paper.”No use. The kids couldn’t make head nor tail of it. So it was replaced with a digital clock.Here’s the thing. If they’re so thick they can’t tell the time, why are they doing A levels?THE bookies reckon the most likely name for the new royal baby is “Arthur”.But there’s also heavy betting on James, Albert and Henry. All the usual suspects, then.However, you can get odds of 200-1 on the new prince being called Kanye and 150-1 on Barry, which I think would be good.My own choice, though, is Nobby.I’m CERTAIN that’s what they’re going to call it. Prince Nobby.Either that or Princey McPrinceface.THE reason we haven’t seen any aliens is because the gravity on their planets is too strong to let them get away.That’s the latest verdict from a bunch of scientists. They want to come see us, obvs.It’s just that every time they build a rocket it rises about six inches off the floor then comes crashing down, because of that gravity.Yeah, right.The reason we haven’t seen any aliens is because there aren’t any.None at all. No six-limbed purple-skinned blobs filled with methane and with sharp, serrated teeth. No grey creatures with weird black eyes.Nothing. Not even micro- scopic organisms.It’s a dead, lifeless void out there, a bit like the inside of Prince Andrew’s skull.ARROGANT knob of the week is referee Andre Marriner.He made a number of very puzzling decisions during the first half of the game between Millwall and Fulham.Then at half-time the Millwall boss Neil Harris mentioned them to him. “Oh,” said Marriner, “I thought I was excellent.”No doubt you did, Andre. I assume he says the same thing to his ­missus after sex.While I would guess she feels pretty much the same way as Harris did.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We share the same blood.We are living with each other. We are brothers.”The Koreas said they hope the parties will be able to declare an official end to the war by the end of this year.Whats happened so far:He made history as he met with rival South Korean President Moon Jae-in for face-to-face talks on the southern side of the border.President Moon said that the two countries would work to re-unite families who had been separated by the decades long conflict as Kim did what his father and grandfather never managed.The dictator said his heart was throbbing as he became the first North Korean leader to cross the 38th parallel since the Korean War ended 65 years ago.The two heads of state had serious, frank discussions on the topic of denuclearising the peninsula during the first meeting on southern soil in more than six decades.Kim even quipped about his missile tests saying he wouldnt disturb the Souths early morning sleep anymore.Both parties are drawing up a joint statement due to be announced together at the close of the discussions which will be followed by a dinner, which would also be attended by Kims wife, Ri Sol Ju. When they met the smiling leaders, who seemed on the brink of war months ago, shook hands as each stood either side of the military demarcation line that bisects the rivals.As the sworn enemies came face-to-face for the first time in the border truce village of Panmunjom, Moon thanked him for making a very courageous decision to come to the South.In an unplanned move, the dictator then invited Moon to cross briefly north with him before they returned to the southern side - an incredible symbol of peace and unity between the warring nations.Moon then took Kims hand in his and led him along a red carpet into South Korean territory, where they were handed flowers by a boy and girl who live in the village.The pictures of them smiling and holding hands struck a stark contrast to the posturing and aggression of past decades.The two heads of state were then met by a South Korean honour guard in historical costumes, who performed an arirang - a traditional Korean folk song.Kim wore glasses and his trademark black Mao suit, while the rest of the North Korean delegation appeared in military uniforms or Western attire.He stopped to write in a guest book in the Souths Peace House before the two leaders met for a private discussion - aimed at ending their decades-long conflict.Signing and dating the entry, he said: A new history starts now. An age of peace, from the starting point of history.Kim: Im glad to meet you. Im so glad.Moon: Was there any difficulty coming here?Kim: Not at all.Moon: Its a pleasure to meet you.Kim: Indeed, Im so filled with excitement because of the meeting at this historic site. And I was truly moved that you have come all the way to receive me at the Military Demarcation Line at Panmunjom.Moon: It was your bold and courageous decision that has allowed us to come this far.Kim: No, no, not at all.Moon: We have made a historic moment.Kim: I am pleased to meet you.Moon: Would you please stand on this side.Kim steps across the Southern borderMoon: You have come to the south side, when will I be able to come to the North?Kim: Maybe this is the right time for you to enter the North Korean territory.Moon steps into the North before both re-enter South KoreaThe summit is the first between the two countries in over a decade and only third-ever between the sworn enemies - who are separated by a conflict that ended with a truce, not a treaty, meaning they are still technically at war.Minutes before Kim entered Peace House, a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, and sprayed apparent disinfectant in the air, on the chairs, and on the guest book.During the discussion, Jong-un told his southern rival he was ready for heartfelt, sincere and honest talks, adding that he doesnt want repeat of past where we were unable to fulfill our agreements. As the talks began on Friday, the North Korean leader said: “As I walked over here, I thought, why was it so difficult to get here?“The separating line wasn’t even that high to cross. It was too easy to walk over that line and it took us 11 years to get here.”According to the official translation provided by the South Korean government, Jong-un also said during opening remarks, with the media present in the room:The expectations are high and we have learned a lesson from previous times and even if we have good agreements and implementations don’t follow they will disappoint people who had high expectations.I hope the 11 years have lost in the past until this time don’t go to waste, and we can meet more often and put our minds together and the 11 years will not be wasted.I hope to write a new chapter between us.I believe that we are able to make a new beginning, and it is with such commitment I come to this meeting.Moon is reported to have said in opening remarks:Spring (is) spreading in South Korea.I believe our encounter is extremely important for all of us. That of course means there is a huge burden on our shoulders.Comrade Kim, for the first time in our history you crossed the military demarcation line. It is no longer a symbol of division but a symbol of peace.I would like to pay tribute to the courageous and bold decision made by you, Chairman Kim.In parts shown on live TV, Kim joked that he hoped Moon would be able to enjoy North Koreas famous cold noodles, which were being brought to a banquet after the summit.But he could be heard turning to his sister - who was sitting to his left - and saying maybe I shouldnt have said (Pyongyang) was far.His younger sister Kim Yo Jong was the first member of the ruling North Korean family to travel to the South in early February for the Olympics.The Foreign Secretary told reporters at NATO headquarters Friday, I am very encouraged by whats happening.I dont think that anybody looking at the history of North Koreas plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point.“But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting.  Absolutely.USAThe White House said in a statement that it is hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula. ... (and) looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.ChinaForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters Beijing wishes that the meeting between the Norths leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will achieve a positive result.JapanKatsunobu Kato, Japans minister for the abduction issue, says he hopes progress will be made at an upcoming summit that Kim is expected to hold with President Donald Trump.RussiaThe Kremlin on Friday hailed a historic summit between the leaders of North and South Korea as very positive news and said President Vladimir Putin had long advocated direct talks between the two countries.When asked about the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump also meeting the North Korean leader, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Moscow welcomed any steps that would ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.The only other North Korean official present was former intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, the top official in charge of relations with the South.Moon in response said there were high expectations surrounding the summit and hoped they produce an agreement that would please the people of Koreas and also every peace-loving person in the world.The discussions also touched on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong which was targeted by a North Korean artillery attack in 2010, killing four, according to Moon Jae-ins senior spokesman Moon told Kim he wished to travel in North Korea to visit Mount Paektu, near the countrys border with China, but Kim said under current conditions it would be uncomfortable due to the transport network.The pair then discussed high-speed train services, with Kim informing his rival his delegates had been impressed by the Souths bullet trains during their visit for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February.A delighted Moon suggested the possibility of connecting the rail networks across borders if relations improve.The discussion went so well that by the time the pair broke for lunch, they had agreed to hold more meetings - with Kim offering to visit Seouls presidential Blue House.In a further show of peace, pine is said to symbolise strength and mindfulness in the Korean martial art of Tae Kwon Do as it grows strong roots below ground and a high above it.The United States is hopeful talks between Kim and Moon will make progress on achieving peace and prosperity, the White House said in a statement as the two men began their summit.The White House also said it looks forward to continuing discussions with South Korea in preparation for the planned meeting of Trump and Kim in the coming weeks.Just months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as North Koreas rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States raised fears of a fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula.Earlier on Friday, North Koreas official KCNA news agency said Kim would open-heartedly discuss with Moon Jae-in all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula.Just days before the summit, Kim said North Korea would suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests and dismantle its only known nuclear test site.Moon travelled to the meeting in a large motorcade, stopping briefly to greet dozens of summit supporters waving South Korean flags near the Blue House.Hundreds of demonstrators were seen gathering in downtown Seoul from early morning to protest or support the summit.Scepticism has been rampant about whether Kim is ready to abandon the hard-earned nuclear arsenal his country has defended and developed for decades as what it says is a necessary deterrent against US invasion.The two neighbours expect to release a joint statement late on Friday - possibly called the Panmunjom Declaration - that could address denuclearisation and peace, and an improvement in relations, South Korean officials said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000401986482.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un embarrassed about north korea","story":"This frank admission came as the communist dictator became the first leader to step into the capitalist South for 65 years in a bid to prevent war in the peninsula.Details of the historic talks have been emerging after Kim arrived at the truce village of Panmunjom to shake hands with his arch-rival President Moon Jae-in.Moons spokesman Yoon Young-chan says Kims comments over the state of his country came after the South Korean leader expressed a desire to travel North to visit Mount Paektu, which touches the countrys border with China.According Al Jazeera, Kim said: “I’d be honestly worried if you come, it might be embarrassing, the transportation is not good.”The dictator then referred to the South Korean KTX bullet train and said they didn’t have anything like that in North Korea.Kim then suggested if he visited he should probably come by air because the roads were “inconvenient”.But the comments about his countrys duff transport services are unlikely to be reported in North Korea.Citizens cannot view outside media and are bombarded with propaganda trumpeting how life in the hermit kingdom is better than any other on earth.But Moon said in response that North Koreans would be able to enjoy the Souths high-speed trains if the rivals improve relations and reconnect their rail networks across the border.North Korean roads are often bumpy and poorly maintained. Its train network is also way out of date compared to his neighbours state-of-the-art high-speed bullet trains. Kim earlier this month met with Chinas ambassador and visited a hospital where Chinese tourists were being treated after a deadly bus crash killed 32 in North Korea."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0004017757091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"alfie evans tribute girl sings this is me","story":"Eleven-year-old Feefi Bennetts rendition of This Is Me from The Greatest Showman soundtrack has been viewed over half a million times since it was uploaded yesterday.During the performance Feefi says: “Alfie Evans we fight we fight for you.

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so.

Life or death.But to achieve this most important goal, or the childs life, you can implement a third, compromise solution. And we are working intensively on it.His team of detectives, dressed in military-style clothing, arrived at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool on Friday - but remained guarded about their plans for Alfie.Journalist Robert Rewinski, who is part of the group, told Sky News: The plan is to protect the child.Tomorrow everything will be clear because this solution is legal - with the situation after the decision of British court.Asked whether they would be taking Alfie out of the UK, he replied: I cant give you the answer today.Mr Rutkowski will do everything he can to take the child as soon as possible, with the safe place.The reporter asks where this is, and he responds: It is a secret today. Tomorrow it will be clear.He added that everything is meant to support Alfie and the family of Alfie.Mr Rewinski praised the TV detectives work, adding that he has 28 years of experience and saves many many children around the world.Earlier this week, one of the judges involved in the case Mr Justice Hayden, slammed some of the advice that had been given to the family by outside groups.Lord Justice McFarlane also warned of a darker side to some of the offers of support received by the boys distressed family.Alfies life support was removed at 9.17pm on Monday and he has been since been put on oxygen.Supporters, dubbed Alfies Army, held a candle-lit vigil at the Vatican on Thursday night as the toddler clung to life in hospital.Following days of fevered demonstrations outside Alder Hey and on social media, Tom Evans, 21, earlier called for it to stop so that his sons final days could be dignified.He said: We are very grateful and we appreciate all the support we have received from around the world, including from our Italian and Polish supporters, who have dedicated their time and support to our incredible fight.His statement followed a crunch meeting with doctors as he and partner Kate hope to get Alfie home after their battle to have him airlifted to Italy ended in defeat.But just hours earlier Tom had blasted medics by claiming they treated his family like criminals.Alfie has been living in a coma for well over a year after being struck down with a mystery illness.Doctors say he is in a semi-vegetative state and has a degenerative neurological condition that they have not definitively diagnosed.Some experts believe he might have a mitochondrial condition - the same as Charlie Gard."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402052678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"james forsyth local elections","story":"The thinking was disastrous local election results would shock Tory MPs into realising they cannot go on like that and that they needed a new leader.But even Mrs May’s most ardent critics have now accepted that next week’s local elections are unlikely to trigger her downfall.Why? Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
