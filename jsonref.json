Unlike crude oil and petroleum, natural gas must be transported through pipelines, and it could take Europe years to build the infrastructure needed to get proper supplies of natural gas from other places. Many liquified natural gas terminals that receive deliveries from the U.S. and Qatar are already maxed out. How much are Russian fuel sales financing the war?  Russia is taking in a whopping $1 billion per day for the oil and gas products it sells to the West each day. It currently sells around 5 million barrels of oil every day, where prices are increasing rapidly. Total revenues for crude oil and refined products amount to about $700 million per day. Where could the U.S. get its oil without Russia? Republicans have for weeks called on the Biden administration to encourage more more oil production within the U.S.  In 2019 the U.S. was the largest crude oil producer in the world, pumping out 13 million barrels per day. Now the nations pumps about 11.5 million barrels per day. And while the U.S. imports crude oil from around the world, it is still exporting millions of barrels per day. \u0027Perhaps we would export a little less oil and hold onto the oil,\u0027 proffered Snape. But one hindrance on keeping oil at home is the 1920 Jones Act. The protectionist law says that ships carrying goods between U.S. ports must be built, crewed and owned by Americans, putting US-made products at a disadvantage against foreign competitors which can use market-rate shipping. The U.S. could also turn to Canada or Latin America to pump up exports. Over the weekend the Biden administration sent a delegation to Venezuela, a close ally of Russia, to meet with the Maduro administration, seeking to rebuild diplomatic relations and plead for more oil. Schork called the idea that Venezuela could pump more oil \u0027a joke,\u0027 and said the Biden administration should focus on being less hostile to domestic production. \u0027The Venezuelan oil industry is a shell of itself due to 20 years of Hugo Chavez’s socialism. Even if Venezuelan production was up, Maduro is in bed with Putin. So we are going to Iran which is a state sponsor of terrorism. We’d rather negotiate with terrorists than Texans.\u0027 Sen. Marco Rubio agreed, writing on Twitter: \u0027Joe Biden using #Russia as an excuse to do the deal they always wanted to do anyway with the #MaduroRegime... Rather than produce more American oil he wants to replace the oil we buy from one murderous dictator with oil from another murderous dictator.\u0027 The U.S. is also nearing agreement on a new nuclear deal with Iran that could lift sanctions and return Iranian oil to market. Biden is also reportedly eyeing up a trip to Saudi Arabia after OPEC nations have for months rebuffed his requests to pump more oil. Biden during the campaign trail promised to make Saudi Arabia a \u0027pariah\u0027 and blamed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The U.S.\u0027s Strategic Petroleum Reserve held 588 million barrels as of the end of January, according to the Energy Department, and Biden last week released 30 million barrels from the reserve in an agreement with European countries that together would release a total of 60 million barrels.    adverts.addToArray({pos:mpu_factbox})AdvertisementU.S. oil industry prepares to boost production ¿ but with a giant warning - POLITICOHow Much Oil Does the U.S. Import From Russia and Why Is Biden Banning It? - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Queue pumps prices near 2 litre","story":"Share this articleShare this articleShare this articleShare this articleRUSSIA-UKRAINE LIVE: Russian death toll put at 12,000 and US bans imports of Vladimir Putin\u0027s oil | Daily Mail OnlineServiced Offices ¿ Office Space to Rent ¿ Offices.co.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"Volodymyr Zelensky delivers historic address House Commons","story":" Share this article In Zhyotymyr, west of Kyiv, a fire at an oil depot was extinguished in the early hours of the morning while in Mykolaiv, in the south, several fires in residential areas had broke out due to Russian attacks - with four civilians killed and five others rescued from the rubble and taken to hospitalIn Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, Russian shelling set nine floors and 27 apartment units of a residential building on fire - a blaze that took rescuers more than four hours to extinguish. At least four people were killed.UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, speaking to the BBC today, said Russian forces are \u0027getting more desperate\u0027 and \u0027we are seeing the Russians just double down on brutality\u0027 as the attack stalls.He says \u0027Russia has still not been making its advances, it\u0027s day 13. That northern column that we have often talked about is still pretty much stuck, I mean really stuck, so that\u0027s not advancing.\u0027He said the UK would be increasing the amount of lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine, details of which he would announce in Parliament on Wednesday, and is helping organise delivery of aid through Nato and other EU countries. Meanwhile Russia has threatened to turn off the main gas pipeline supplying Europe if the West goes ahead with sanctions on its oil sector - a move that Moscow says would push the price up above $300 per barrel. Germany and the UK have ruled out penalising Russia\u0027s energy sector - one of the nation\u0027s only economic lifelines - arguing that the European economy needs more time to adjust before the taps are turned off. But the US today announced plans to ban imports of Russian oil, sending the average price of gasoline in the US to a record $4.17 per gallon.  The national average rose by 10 cents per gallon in one day, and is up 55 cents since last week, according to American Automobile Association data. The previous high was set 13 years ago when the national average price hit $4.10 per gallon. The price of benchmark US crude also jumped 8 per cent Tuesday to more than $129 per barrel.Americans can expect the current trend at the pump to continue as long as crude prices climb, the AAA said. \u0027We will not be part of subsidizing Putin\u0027s war,\u0027 Biden declared, calling the new action a \u0027powerful blow\u0027 against Russia\u0027s ability to fund the ongoing offensive.The US imports about 100,000 barrels a day from Russia, only about 5 per cent of Russia\u0027s crude oil exports, according to Rystad Energy. Last year, roughly 8 per cent of US imports of oil and petroleum products came from Russia.With the Russian invasion of Ukraine well into its second week, a steady rain of shells and rockets continues to fall on population centres like Bucha. The mayor of the Kyiv suburb, Anatol Fedoruk, said military fire had been heavy and constant.\u0027We can\u0027t even gather up the bodies because the shelling from heavy weapons doesn\u0027t stop day or night,\u0027 Mr Fedoruk said. In one of the most desperate cities, the encircled southern port of Mariupol, an estimated 200,000 people - nearly half the population of 430,000 - are still hoping to flee, but Ukrainian authorities have been reluctant to accept Russia\u0027s offer of humanitarian corridors, arguing that previous ceasefire arrangements had been broken with many civilians killed as a result. The Russian UN ambassador on Monday night forecast a potential cease-fire for the morning and appeared to suggest that humanitarian paths leading away from Kyiv and other cities could give people choice in where they want to go - a change from previous proposals that offered only destinations in Russia or Belarus.But the office of embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not comment on the latest Russian proposal, saying only that Moscow\u0027s plans can be believed only if a safe evacuation begins which has thus far not been possible.Demands for effective passageways have surged amid intensifying shelling by Russian forces. The steady bombardments, including in some of Ukraine\u0027s most populated regions, have yielded a humanitarian crisis of diminishing food, water and medical supplies.Through it all, Mr Zelensky said Ukrainian forces were showing unprecedented courage.\u0027The problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers, and for one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,\u0027 Mr Zelensky told ABC News in an interview that aired on Monday night.But he noted that the gap in strength was diminishing and that even if Russian forces \u0027come into all our cities,\u0027 they will be met with an insurgency. "},{"url":null,"title":"The Power Dog director says wanted movie fetishized interview","story":"Share this articleBenedict Cumberbatch responds to The Power of the Dog criticismJane Campion on The Power of the Dog: ‘Too much leather and ropes and chaps?

When it comes to choosing a postgraduate course there are more flexible options available these days than ever before: students can still immerse themselves in a one-year full-time or two-year part-time masters programme, but they can also take shorter courses leading to a postgraduate diploma or certificate, or get specific training through an online course with Solas or a private provider such as Digital Charity Lab. We spoke to three experts about how students can ensure they get the right course and the right advice.Seamus Hoyne is dean of flexible and work-based learning at the Technological University of the Shannon (TUS) Midlands-Midwest, which formed from a merger of Athlone Institute of Technology and Limerick Institute of Technology. Marie McManamon is an independent careers consultant, qualified guidance counsellor and owner of Clearcut Career Guidance (Clearcut.ie). And, Prof Martine Smith is dean of graduate studies at Trinity College Dublin. What are the worst reasons to do a postgraduate? Seamus Hoyne: People who are successful in their studies are doing it because they like the subject. Some may have commenced a masters because it has become the trend in their sector, even though they don’t really want or need to do it. It’s so important to choose something that you will enjoy.Marie McManamon: If you don’t have clear career goals. I see too many graduates who either didn’t like their primary degree but finished it and then moved on to postgraduate study without taking time to do any career planning. I’ve seen graduates take on unrelated masters and still not enjoy the course because there was no strategy behind it. Unrealistic expectations are a real factor for undergraduates, with a mistaken belief that every third-level course has a direct pathway into a specific job or career area. When this doesn’t happen, panic can set in and jumping into another course is seen as a short-term fix – but it’s not.Marie McManamon: They should be guided by a strong career decision-making process. So engage with college career services, available for a year after graduating, generally (although this varies from college to college and some offer career guidance to their graduates for years or even decades). If unable to do so, consider getting professional help: it’s worth the time and investment. Some services, like the Adult Guidance Service at the local education and training board are free, if you can access them. Build your own self-awareness. See also CareersPortal and GradIreland resources online. Martine Smith: Students should think carefully about the time they have available to them. Full-time (or even two-year part-time) courses generally best suit students who know exactly what they want to do and who have few other demands on their time and energy. Those who are less certain about their key interest, or their ability to juggle a new course with other demands may find that shorter commitments offer them the opportunity to ensure they have made a good choice, that the environment suits them and that they have found the course they hoped they would. Other key things to consider include the scheduling of classes, the potential to engage online, the extent to which access to the campus might be necessary – such as for libraries – and how those demands can fit within all the other pulls and pushes on postgraduate students. Seamus Hoyne: The real value of a postgraduate is in the taught components and dissertation: you are building skills for analytical work, including synthesis and analysis. You will learn something from every course, and you will develop real-life skills that can be applied across any sector of society or the economy. Martine Smith: Postgraduate students need multiple different options in order to pursue their educational ambitions. For a long time, most programmes have offered the option of doing a masters full time in one year, or else completing the taught components in the first year and then doing a research dissertation over the second year. Increasingly, new courses are configured so that students can pursue a masters degree over 12 months, 24 months or 36 months, with multiple exit points. They may choose to stop with a postgraduate certificate (30 credits) and change tack entirely or decide they have met their career aspirations. Alternatively, they may go on to study for a further 30 credits and get a postgraduate diploma the following year. Some students know from the start that they really want to pursue a piece of research – something they can choose for themselves and really explore in depth. This is the 30-credit element that leads to the award of a masters degree. With so many job and career opportunities available at the moment, are they worth doing?Marie McManamon: Graduate recruitment programmes offer excellent opportunities including training and experience across functional areas. If you are unsure about courses, perhaps work first to gain experience and better understanding of your preferred roles. You can always return to study later. There are endless options. Also consider Springboard (not for newly graduated) or other Human Capital Initiative (HCI) courses which are funded.The cost of a postgraduate course can run anywhere from €4,000-€8,000, while some MBAs are over €20,000. How can I afford it?Seamus Hoyne: The Student Universal Support Ireland (Susi) doesn’t offer the same level of support to postgraduates as they do to undergraduates (see Susi.ie for more details) but there are courses offered through Springboard.ie where the State will cover up to 90 per cent of the costs. Many companies will also support their staff in pursuing postgraduate study.Where can graduates get good advice and information about courses?Seamus Hoyne: There’s good information on all the third-level websites, and colleges, including TUS, are open to phone calls and discussions. People can also check out research postgraduates that will allow them carry out a project with a third level while working with their company on a part-time basis. And then there are sites like GradIreland which are great for information on jobs and postgraduate learning. What else should postgraduates know about?Marie McManamon: Check that any courses are accredited by the relevant professional body (so that your qualification is recognised where you need it to be – although sometimes you simply need a skill for an existing or upcoming role in, for instance, graphic design, and you don’t necessarily need formal professional accreditation), such as CIPD for HR management and PSI for psychology courses.Martine Smith: Other innovations that are emerging are an increasing emphasis on short courses, such as continuing professional development options, Masterclasses and Micro-credentials. The Government’s recent Human Capital Initiative gave significant support to the sector to start work on developing these smaller learning options focused on very specific skill needs and linked carefully to enterprise demand. They offer learners the opportunity to make very targeted decisions about specific skill needs, as well as a “taster” that might help to guide decisions about embarking on something bigger in scale. Note: Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) is the formal and official accreditation body for courses in Ireland, and they accredit public and private courses providers for in-person and online learning within the National Framework of Qualifications. For many short online courses which simply help build a specific skill as part of continuous professional development, such as massive online open courses (MOOCs) or courses provided over Udemy, however, QQI accreditation may be less important."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"\u0026ldquoWindthrow is now the greatest threat to economic forestry in IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"all women firm with four day week friday off means we have weekends to ourselves","story":" Alex Duggan (from left), Laura Dignam, Brianna Morris, Sinead Deens, Nora Morris, Maggie Greene and Lesa Malone at the  Brady Management Global office in Ballycoolin, Dublin.

Some are our daughters and daughters-in-law and others are friends or people they’ve worked with in the past. They just happen to be all women.”She added: “We have had men here on work placement in the past so we are by no means anti-men.” The company helps businesses with matters such as book-keeping and payroll and has clients in Ireland and the US, where it is seeking to expand. Due to Covid-19, staff were equipped to work from home but they all decided they wanted to return to the office.“We have hot-water bottles to ease any period pain. We have slippers for all the girls to keep cosy in winter and as we are aware of staff who are going through the menopause, we have fans at the ready to quell the hot flushes,” Lesa said.“The girls leave notes for each other all the time with messages of support. So if someone is at college one of the days, they’ll come back to find a note saying they hoped the classes went well and that they had a great day. That kind of thing.”Check-upsHaving seen their mother Bridget die at a young age from cancer, and having had their own health challenges, the sisters encourage staff to have regular check-ups. The company introduced a four-day working week in 2019 in order to ensure working mothers were not spending their weekends cleaning or food shopping.“It was something Lesa and I discussed pre-Covid because as working mothers, we found we were spending Saturday and Sunday cleaning the house or doing the laundry or the food shopping,” said Nora.“Having the Friday off means we can do all that and then have the weekends to ourselves. . . The girls are delighted. They do a few hours extra over the other four days and then have the longer weekend.”On International Women’s Day, Lesa and Nora insist that women need more flexibility in the workplace, especially if they have children, and their approach has made staff retention easy.“No one wants to leave,” said Nora. “Everyone tells us they are here to stay until they retire.

Photograph:  Collins CourtsFacebook messages between Lisa Smith and known jihadists in Syria and Australia will be admitted as evidence into the former soldier’s trial on charges of membership of Isis and funding terrorism, the Special Criminal Court has ruled.Ms Smith’s lawyers had asked the court to refuse to admit the messages, saying the use of private conversations that are stored indefinitely by Facebook is a breach of privacy rights. They also argued that the material, which was initially discovered by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was gathered without any consideration of Ms Smith’s rights and shared with gardaí without any protocols as to how the material should be shared.Mr Justice Tony Hunt, who delivered the judgment of the three-judge, non-jury court, rejected all arguments made by Ms Smith’s lawyers. He said it is now customary in criminal trials for the accused to invoke the right to privacy under the Constitution to render their third-party conversations as inadmissible. He added: “The difficulty for iniduals relying on this right is that it is far from absolute and its exercise is balanced against whatever other constitutional rights and values arise in the context.”In a criminal trial, he said, the privacy right must be balanced against society’s right to have “proper and effective investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime”. He said that complaints about Facebook retaining data for long periods do not mean that the court must exclude such evidence when gathered by gardaí.He said the obligation on gardaí is to gather all potentially relevant evidence, adding: “In our view this does not involve debating whether a third party is or is not in breach of some contractual or statutory obligation pertaining to the potential evidence.”TrespassInvestigations into serious crime, the judge said, require trespass on the rights of citizens. He added: “This is simply part of the social contract that applies in a democratic society.”Ms Smith (40) from Dundalk, Co Louth, has pleaded not guilty to membership of an unlawful terrorist group, Islamic State, between October 28th, 2015 and December 1st, 2019. She has also pleaded not guilty to financing terrorism by sending €800 in assistance, via a Western Union money transfer, to a named man on May 6th, 2015.The judge said that Ms Smith’s conversations were not “surreptitiously or unfairly recorded” but were recorded due to her decision to use Facebook. She must, the court said, “have been taken to have consented in some way to retention and use of her data by Facebook, which is well known to be the quid pro quo for ostensibly free use of the messaging facility.” There was no State involvement in the decision to retain Ms Smith’s conversations and, in all the circumstances, Justice Hunt said any infringement on the accused’s privacy right “falls well short of outweighing the competing rights of the People to adduce otherwise relevant and admissible material in this trial.”The judge also rejected the defence’s claims that two warrants used by gardaí to gather the messages from Facebook headquarters in Dublin were flawed. Mr Justice Hunt said the information supplied by gardaí to the judges provided a rational basis for the warrants to be issued and did not contain any inaccuracy which would cause them to be invalidated.The evidence received by gardaí from the FBI, Justice Hunt said, is permissible under legislation providing for mutual assistance between international police forces.ResearchThe court has also on Tuesday heard from Dr Florence Gaub, an expert on the Middle East who is a director with the European Institute for Security Studies. She told prosecution counsel Sean Gillane SC that she researches military actors in the region, focusing on Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Libya.Ms Smith’s lawyers are objecting to Dr Gaub’s evidence.Dr Gaub told Mr Gillane about the history of the conflict in Syria, beginning in 2011 with the “Arab spring” uprisings and leading to the emergence of Isis in Iraq, a group that later spread to Syria. In January 2014 Isis took over the city of Raqqa in Syria and nominated it as the capital of a new “proto-state” called Islamic State or the Caliphate. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi became the leader of Isis in 2014, she said, and called on all Muslims to travel to Syria or make “hijrah”. Baghdadi said it was obligatory for Muslims to travel if they could and it was clear, Dr Gaub said, that he wanted people to travel not just for military purposes but also to build a state.Isis believed in the apocalypse, Dr Gaub said, and looked to a number of signs that the end times were coming. People making hijrah, or breaking with their tribes, was prophesied by Mohammed as a sign of the end time, as was the raising of the black flag – one of the symbols of Isis.People making hijrah was so important to Isis that it created structures so that when people arrived they would be taken care of with salaries, housing and food, Dr Gaub said. They would get preferential treatment over others already in the caliphate.Western women, she said, were particularly important because they “showed the success story of Isis in attracting people from a different country and culture”. Western women were also encouraged to be active on social media and were “more exposed and more important than Arab women” to Isis.Propaganda voicesIn the early days of the caliphate, women had no strategic role in military campaigns or in fighting on the front lines, but they played a role in recruiting, fundraising and as propaganda voices on social media, the witness said. At times they were also employed as “moral police”, enforcing dress codes and behaviour rules for women. As Isis came under pressure following the fall of Raqqa in 2016, she said women were deployed in more aggressive roles. In the very end days of Islamic State, she said, women were given weapons to fight.She described Isis as a totalitarian organisation which is “highly intolerant of anybody who does not share its point of view”.It uses “very brutal” violence, including beheadings, drownings, stonings, crucifixions and burning to “inflict terror in anybody who is watching”.She added: “It sees the world in two camps you are in or you are not in. And if you are not in, violence against you is permissible.” It expresses this view, Dr Gaub said, through its propaganda channels including a magazine called Dabiq. Dabiq, she said, gets its name from a town in northern Syria where it is prophesied in Islam that the apocalypse will come following a battle there.Through its propaganda, Dr Gaub said Isis had attracted a high number of converts, especially among women. Isis recruiters, she said, are very skilled at recognising people’s grievances and would tell their targets that the grievance would be remedied by joining the Islamic State. Often they would leverage a source of depression such as a breakup, orce, job loss or the death of a parent. Isis would offer the person a sense of belonging, meaning or community, she said.Often people were recruited online, which Dr Gaub said is faster than face-to-face radicalisation and happens in larger numbers. Once they were convinced to travel to Syria, they would be cut off from friends and family and would be easier to indoctrinate.Isis recruiters would also tell people how to travel to Syria undetected and would urge people not to tell family and friends or to share their beliefs with anyone.Dr Gaub said the “doomsday” scenario presented by Isis may seem strange but is present in a lot of cults. She said: “It creates an in-group versus out-group, the group that knows and the group that doesn’t. It creates a strong sense of cohesion, belonging and meaning. If you know when it all ends and what it all means, you are an elite compared to everyone else. That is what Isis did.”Dr Gaub will be cross-examined by defence counsel Michael O’Higgins SC on Thursday.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics europe s turning point","story":"Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has brought about enormous changes in European policy in an incredibly short space of time.

The man, later arrested, said “I’ve done my bit lads. It’s about time the rest of Ireland done their bit. Video: Laura MothLukasz RyzNew security barriers have been erected around the perimeter of the Russian Embassy in Rathgar, in Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos Russia has summoned Ireland’s ambassador in Moscow over the ramming of a truck into the gates of its embassy in Dublin, seeking an official apology and the cost of repairs.Irish diplomat Brian McElduff was called to Russia’s foreign ministry on Tuesday where Kremlin officials complained over a truck reversing through the gates at its embassy in Rathgar.Russia’s state-owned news outlet Tass reported that the Russian foreign ministry issued a “strong protest in connection with an incident with a security breach” at the embassy.The ministry referred to what it describe “the inadmissibility of ‘blatant inaction of law enforcement agencies in Ireland when such actions are committed in the presence of policemen’”.“We also expect the authorities of this country to conduct an objective investigation and punish those responsible.”Lorry driver Desmond Wisley (49) appeared in court in Dublin on Tuesday charged with criminal damage and dangerous driving in connection with the crash.In the aftermath of the incident, the Russian embassy accused the Government of violating international law for allowing it to take place. The embassy claimed members of the Garda “stood idle” as the truck reversed into the gates.The embassy later said in a follow-up statement that additional measures had been taken by the Garda to ensure the safety and security of the embassy and its personnel.“The embassy appreciates cooperation by the Irish authorities in this matter,” it said.Speaking on a visit to the UN in New York, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney confirmed the Irish ambassador in Moscow met Russian foreign ministry officials over the incident.Mr Coveney described the incident as “unfortunate and unhelpful,” echoing similar comments by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar who called it “foolish and unhelpful.”“It will be used by some in an unhelpful way. But we are addressing that and we have and continue to speak to the Russian embassy about it,” Mr Coveney said.Mr Varadkar said that the truck incident could be “misrepresented in Russian state TV as Irish people involved in violent acts against Russians”.“It may be the case that the person behind it had strong feelings on this issue, but it was not helpful at all because we have obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomats that are here in Ireland. So it was a foolish and unhelpful act in that regard.”While people were entitled to protest, such protests should be peaceful with “no violence” and “no criminal damage.”Government sources denied that there was an angry exchange between Mr McElduff and Russian foreign ministry officials at the meeting over the truck incident at the embassy.“A strong diplomatic protest was lodged,” said one source in Dublin.Asked about the ambassador’s meeting in Moscow, a spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said it did not comment on security issues or incidents.“As is normal, the department remains in regular contact with the Russian Embassy in Dublin on a range of issues and the same is the case in respect of our embassy in Moscow and the Russian Foreign Ministry,” she said.In a tweet posted on Tuesday afternoon, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had summoned Mr McElduff, the ambassador, and “demanded an official apology from the Irish leadership”.The account said Mr McElduff was “strongly protested in connection with the security incident,” according to a translation of its post generated by Twitter.On Monday evening security barriers were erected to create a buffer between the embassy and protesters.The incident comes days after Russian ambassador Yury Filatov told Russian TV the situation in Ireland was “frankly difficult”.He accused Ireland of being to the forefront of “anti-Russian events” in the European Union."},{"url":null,"title":"inside nigeria s booming music industry the world needs to listen to us","story":"Patoranking, one of Nigeria’s most successful musicians, pictured at his recording studio.

Impounding the yachts of billionaire oligarchs is incidental to the true source of financing for Vladimir Putin’s war – energy exports.Last Friday, as rockets rained down on civilian areas, Shell stepped in to the market to buy a substantial quantity of Russian oil at a heavily discounted price. This was not in breach of the sanctions because they do not cover energy sales.Such was the obloquy heaped on Shell that it subsequently pledged to give any profits to a relief fund for Ukrainian refugees. The company said that, while it was appalled by the events in Ukraine, “we currently purchase it … to ensure that we continue the production of essential fuels and products that people and businesses rely on every day.” Herein lies the conundrum. People in the West are horrified by what is going on in Ukraine but how much disruption to their own lives are they prepared to put up with to demonstrate their concern?Shell was buying the oil to meet consumer demand in the absence of any other immediately available sources. It may be possible to find alternatives but it will take time, assuming other producers are ready to play ball. An embargo on Russian oil would have a massive knock-on impact on the global economy, not just Russia’s, as was apparent from the fall in global stock markets.To a great extent a de facto embargo is already in place since traders are largely shunning Russian crude. Shell bought at a heavily discounted price because the producers are struggling to offload it. As storage sites fill up, Russia will be forced to cut production with potentially calamitous consequences for its industry.On the markets, the price of a barrel is now at a 10-year high, which means bonanza revenues for Russia if it could sell the oil at spot prices. An embargo would make any such purchases unlawful and seriously harm Putin even if he were able to sell some to China. But there can be no pretence that it will not damage Western economies, though America is much less exposed than Europe, where there is little appetite for an embargo as was clear at the No 10 summit yesterday.The added danger is that such a move reinforces Putin’s domestic narrative that the West has ganged up on Russia. Death by a thousand cuts might be a better option.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife condemns Kremlin for \u0026#39mass murder\u0026#39 of childrenJohn Bercow banned from Parliament after inquiry brands him ‘serial bully’Grant Shapps ‘impounds’ private jet linked to Roman Abramovich’s oligarch friendFracking back on the agenda as Boris Johnson blocks imports of Russian oilPressure on British Museum as Smithsonian gives back entire Benin Bronze collection to NigeriaSajid Javid: NHS cash is being wasted on preventable diseasesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second golden age north sea oil possible","story":"They are images from another era: tanks dispatched from Moscow to crush independence in Europe. But the violence in Ukraine has not only turned back the clock to Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1968, it has also turned back the clock on energy policy in Britain. Above all, it has made the Government reconsider our own oil and gas resources under the North Sea, written off for years – like the Cold War itself – as part of our dirty past. Now, however, as Moscow’s missiles rain down on Kyiv, and Russia threatens the West, a new attitude is beginning to take shape. Rather than the usual news of shutdowns and decline, this week it is a new round of North Sea exploration licences that is to be announced. As Russian tankers are turned away from British ports, the national regulator is poised to greenlight six new extraction projects, with the Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisting that “it would be complete madness to turn off our domestic source of gas”. Suddenly, the ugly sister of UK energy is being invited back to the ball. For decades, indeed, the industry was like Cinderella herself – the subject of a rags-to-riches tale that made Britain the envy of Europe. The rags were worn in the middle of last century. Then, when the North Sea was proving a scratchy, hard-luck story for oil and gas prospectors, two senior industry executives famously had a bet. “If there’s oil down there,” the more pessimistic of the two concluded, “I’ll drink every last barrel.”Drink up. With the 1970s came the astonishing discovery of huge deposits – including Brent, the oilfield synonymous with Britain’s black gold. Tens of billions of barrels have been extracted since, not to mention more than 2,750 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas. And there are billions more still down there.But there’s been no happy ever after. While our North Sea partner, Norway, has become a global energy superstar and vastly rich in the process, we in Britain have become indebted oil and gas importers and are facing soaring energy prices – set to be exacerbated still further by the Ukraine crisis. So have we squandered our inheritance? And as we face increasing competition for energy abroad and a continent once more at war, will we make the best of what’s left? Or will we heed the protests of climate change campaigners, and leave it far beneath the waves?Investment in the North Sea has already fallen from more than £16bn in 2014 to just £3bn today. “If this goes on it could fall to £1bn by 2025,” says Boroujerdi. “All hope of a late North Sea recovery would be dashed.”That would cap a dismal quarter of a century for the North Sea industry in which the good old days of vast discoveries like the Brent and Forties fields were already a distant memory. “In the 1970s and 1980s a field of 100 million barrels was very small,” says Alex Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen and author of a two-volume history of North Sea exploration. “Now it\u0027s regarded as large. We don’t get billion-barrel fields. The average size of a new discovery today is 20 million barrels.”That trend was briefly bucked in 2001, with the discovery of the Buzzard oilfield, with reserves of 1.5 billion barrels, now producing almost 90,000 barrels a day. But the truth even then was that the British industry was in decline. Production had peaked two years before, in 1999, with 137 million tonnes. In 2020 that figure was 49 million. Gas production reached its own zenith in 2000, with 115 billion cubic metres. Today it’s 39 billion. Having reached, almost out of nowhere, energy independence in the 1980s, Britain became a net importer in 2004. Further decline is predicted at a rate of about 5-7 per cent a year. There are fewer exploration wells than at any time since 1965. Such decline carries three clear consequences. The first, counterintuitively, is environmental, for even the most dedicated campaigner does not dispute that oil and gas must play a part in the transition to net neutral. The question is merely where the oil and gas comes from in the decades until we are green and clean. Weaning ourselves off Russian energy makes perfect geopolitical sense, especially given Putin’s threats to cut Europe off. But it also makes environmental sense because, as Greg Hands, minister for business, energy and clean growth, puts it: “Most studies will put it pretty strongly that homegrown oil and gas is generally more climate-friendly than imports.” It’s obvious why. Even if production abroad is as clean as UK production, which is not always the case, transporting vast quantities of energy halfway around the world, in pipelines or in vast tankers, is dirty. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife condemns Kremlin for \u0026#39mass murder\u0026#39 of childrenJohn Bercow banned from Parliament after inquiry brands him ‘serial bully’Grant Shapps ‘impounds’ private jet linked to Roman Abramovich’s oligarch friendFracking back on the agenda as Boris Johnson blocks imports of Russian oilPressure on British Museum as Smithsonian gives back entire Benin Bronze collection to NigeriaSajid Javid: NHS cash is being wasted on preventable diseasesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"top british lawyer worked russian oligarch accused creating","story":"One of Britain’s leading QC’s has been accused of introducing “loopholes” into British sanctions law after working for a Putin-linked oligarch.Lord Pannick QC proposed amendments to legislation in 2017 which allow the Government to act against oligarchs after representing Arkady Rotenberg, a close friend and judo partner of Vladimir Putin and one of Russia’s richest men.The Government has blamed the “cumbersome” amendments to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 for slowing down its sanction response to the invasion of Ukraine.Concern over such cases has led to calls for greater transparency of interests in Parliament, where barristers are required to disclose their earnings but not necessarily those that they represent.Lord Pannick said on Tuesday that he did not legislate for loopholes but ensured the Government followed the rule of law. He said he did not believe the amendments were responsible for delays.Almost 100 oligarchs who have been sanctioned by the EU or US have not been penalised in Britain, which has only targeted 13 Putin allies since the invasion began.A Bill to make it easier and quicker to impose tougher sanctions passed the Commons on Monday and is expected to become law later this month.But as the Bill makes its way to the upper house, Matt Hancock, the former Cabinet minister, raised the fact that “many of the problems that we face today are due to amendments” made in the Lords to the 2018 Bill.“It\u0027s subsequently come to light that many of those amendments were by those who are acting for oligarchs and then legislating for loopholes,” he told Parliament.Mr Hancock did not name Lord Pannick but quoted the QC, who in a 2017 debate asked why “sanctions should be imposed on a person simply because they are connected to a specified country”.Mr Hancock described the comments as “extremely unwise” and said that the reason the UK’s response was slow was “because the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 was riddled with holes” in the Lords.He added: “I am surprised to discover that some of those who spoke so powerfully for putting loopholes in place, and who made the case for confusion and delay in law, are also those who stand to benefit from confusion and delay in law, and they do not declare this conflict.“Simply declaring earnings from the Bar is not good enough. Parliamentarians should make their interests crystal clear so that there is no confusion around them when they legislate in this area.”Amendments accepted by GovernmentLord Pannick insisted on Tuesday: I did not put forward amendments to legislate for loopholes. I put forward amendments… to ensure that the Sanctions Act complied with basic requirements of the rule of law”.He pointed out that the amendments were accepted by the Government.Lord Pannick represented Rotenberg in 2014 and 2015 in his legal battle against the sanctions imposed on him by the EU over the annexation of Crimea.The billionaire tycoon’s construction company was given a state contract to build a bridge between Russia and Crimea which the UK Government said “further undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine”.The case in the General Court of the European Union was “the first case in which someone has challenged the EU’s Russia sanctions regime”, lawyers working alongside Lord Pannick noted.Lord Pannick also represented Rotenberg “on a sanctions point” in the Court of Appeal during a bitter orce from his wife at around the same time.The 70-year-old, who made most of his fortune through lucrative state-sponsored contracts for construction and oil pipelines, was also sanctioned in the UK and the USA in 2014.Boris Rotenberg, his brother, and his son Igor have both been added to the sanction list because of the latest invasion.The amendments to the earlier bill proposed by Lord Pannick and Lord Judge, the former lord chief justice of England and Wales, forced ministers to consider whether the sanctions were appropriate in all circumstances and required them to provide reasons for the sanctions.Lord Judge has been a serving judge for several decades and is not said to have acted for any oligarchs.Lord Pannick said that the changes “do not explain the fact that the Government has so far sanctioned so few Russians”, adding: “My understanding is that the reason why the UK has sanctioned so few iniduals is because too few people are working on the details of imposing sanctions in the Foreign Office and in other Government departments.”He accused ministers of “exaggerating the risk of our courts intervening in such cases” as the judicial review court was unlikely to intervene as long as their action had a “tenable basis”.Lord Pannick added that he had not acted for Rotenberg since mid-2015 and it is the only sanction matter he has acted in at least the last 10 years.“I saw no reason at the end of 2017 and early 2018 when the Sanctions Bill was debated to refer to one case in which I had advised and acted almost two and a half years earlier and in which I had no continuing role,” he told the .“The only other Russian oligarch for whom I have acted in the last 10 years is Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a prominent opponent of Putin.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky\u0026#39s wife condemns Kremlin for \u0026#39mass murder\u0026#39 of childrenJohn Bercow banned from Parliament after inquiry brands him ‘serial bully’Grant Shapps ‘impounds’ private jet linked to Roman Abramovich’s oligarch friendFracking back on the agenda as Boris Johnson blocks imports of Russian oilPressure on British Museum as Smithsonian gives back entire Benin Bronze collection to NigeriaSajid Javid: NHS cash is being wasted on preventable diseasesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"virtue signalling mps could hardly have made bigger mess energy","story":"We could hardly have made a bigger pig’s ear of our domestic energy policy had we tried. The crisis in Ukraine has exposed the flaws, mistakes and downright complacency that has been evident for years to everyone except politicians desperate to burnish their green credentials whatever the cost.The so-called “net zero” commitment was the last act of Theresa May before she stepped down as prime minister in July 2019 but has been enthusiastically endorsed by her successor in a series of speeches and announcements. Until now, that is. Boris Johnson says there needs to be a new supply strategy in response to the energy crunch caused by Russia’s invasion, and he wants a temporary “climate change pass” to help manage the difficulties it has caused.Apparently this does not entail changing the 2050 target but rather ramping up oil and gas production in Europe so that countries such as Germany and Italy are less dependent on Russian supplies.He vouchsafed his new approach in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica and the German publication Die Welt last week. “We need a collective European strategy and a Western strategy to ersify away from this dependence,” Johnson reportedly said. “There are other sources ... in North America, in Canada, in the Gulf.”And in the UK, he might have added, but didn’t. Here, in a nutshell, was Britain’s green policy: we can make commitments to decarbonise our own energy supplies while importing the same products from other countries.It is the antithesis of energy security: a reliance on others to provide fuel for industry, heating and motoring while ignoring the available resources under our own feet. It is telling that on his list of alternatives is the Gulf, hardly the most stable of regions. Britain relies on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar to supplement pipeline supplies from Norway and the EU. This market-based import strategy follows the deliberate run-down of our own reserves, even though gas accounts for 40 per cent of UK electricity generation and heats the majority of homes. It assumes unimpeded supply while anticipating price volatility caused by circumstances. So the recent spike in prices was caused not by Russia but by the recovery of the world economy after the “unforeseen” Covid pandemic. This has now been exacerbated by fears of an embargo on Russian gas and oil which has seen market prices soar to unprecedented levels, even though European leaders are determined to resist emulating the import ban announced by President Biden last night.It is all well and good relying on LNG from Qatar, but if there were tensions in the Gulf between Israel and Iran over nuclear weapons, Tehran could block the Straits of Hormuz, stopping supplies of LNG.Anyone who says this is an unlikely scenario was presumably offering assurances to all who would listen that Russian would never invade Ukraine. The point is that you never know what might happen, which is why we need to secure our own supplies as much as possible.Yet it is instructive to look back at the debates in the Commons on the legislation to impose carbon reduction targets. You will find precious little discussion about the likely impact on price or supply. The 2008 Climate Change Act was opposed by precisely five Conservative MPs, denounced as “flat-earthers”, even by their own side, for deigning to ask whether the strategy was sensible.It committed the UK to reduce emissions by 80 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050, which was increased from a previous target of 60 per cent with hardly any debate. All that seemed to matter was that Britain was the “first country” in the world to adopt such a target, that this was a “landmark” moment and a “unique” measure. Its ramifications were simply trampled under a stampede of virtue signallers.The target was increased to 100 per cent by the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019, a statutory instrument that went through the Commons after a 90-minute debate. This is how matters of great strategic import are handled in this country – and not only here, it must be said. If you think our policy is bad, just look at Germany’s, where the madcap decision to dismantle its entire nuclear power programme is now being reversed.Mr Johnson’s new supply strategy, to be published “in days”, will give the go-ahead to North Sea oil and gas fields that have been awaiting approval but will only now get it because foreseeable events have come to pass. This strategy should also remove the moratorium on shale gas extraction, or fracking, but almost certainly won’t, denying the country an energy source that Mr Johnson himself once saw as our salvation.It should include a feasibility study of thorium-based nuclear reactors, using a fuel which is cleaner, cheaper and safer than uranium but which has always been blocked on cost grounds.It should include proper storage facilities: the decision to close the Rough facility in the North Sea and rely on contracted deliveries or the spot market was a massive mistake. It should include a re-examination of tidal barrage power dismissed in the past as too expensive but which looks cheap compared with the likely long-term costs of oil and gas.Tides in the UK are higher than almost anywhere in the world and can be harnessed every day under any conditions, unlike solar or wind power. The sea will rise and fall with metronomic precision twice a day until the Earth stops spinning and the Moon drops out of the sky.As an example of procrastination, the approach to tidal power takes some beating. The Severn Barrage, an engineering project to harness the tidal energy of Britain’s longest river and produce enough electricity to power all of Wales, was originally proposed in 1925, only to be shelved because, at £25 million, it was considered too expensive.In 1971, it was estimated that a barrage could be built at a cost £500  million. But since North Sea oil and gas was coming on stream there was no incentive to invest in tidal power. Various proposals have been put forward recently, both on the Severn and in Swansea Bay, but the cost is estimated in the billions of pounds and is opposed on environmental grounds.

Yet it still happened to me.” The Labour MP highlighted the importance of breaking down stigmas surrounding abuse. She recalled the case of one survivor who was raped, and then confronted in court with the barbaric scare tactic of having to open an evidence file to a photo of the man who violently abused her. “The courts are complicit in the abuse that women face - this needs to change now”, she said. In another case, she said, Helen lost everything - her home, her friends, her career - her father died and her mother was sectioned, both broken by watching their daughter go through such an ordeal. The man involved was found not guilty. Her speech comes as  members of the Shadow Cabinet wrote to their Government counterparts urging them to launch a cross-departmental strategy to tackle the epidemic of VAWG.In a letter seen by The Mirror, Labour MPs said on International Women’s Day: “We are writing to you as Shadow Secretaries of State to ask you, our opposite numbers, to recognise that this is an issue that cuts across departments and can no longer be siloed. “It must and can only be addressed by Government as a whole. “The scale of our action must meet the scale of this crisis. We believe we all have a responsibility to ensure that ours is the last generation plagued by violence against women, and we know that there is widespread support, both from the public and from organisations across the sector, to make this commitment a reality.”Earlier today, senior Tory MP Caroline Nokes told the BBC Boris Johnson must “step up and show that he does take womenaposs safety seriously” by supporting new legislation to criminalise public sexual harassment.A YouGov survey found that % of women across the UK do not feel safe walking alone at night, at least some of the time. It came after MPs said a culture of toxic misogyny in the Met Police uncovered in the wake of Sarah Everardaposs death must lead to better vetting. As part of International Womenaposs Day on Tuesday, MPs from across the political spectrum took part in a Westminster Hall debate on the reports of misogyny and sexual harassment in the countryaposs largest force. It is just over a year since Ms Everardaposs rape and murder at the hands of serving police officer Wayne Couzens. A recent report into Charing Cross police station uncovered a catalogue of deeply disturbing racist, homophobic and misogynistic messages exchanged between officers, the handling of which led to outgoing Met Police chief Cressida Dick being forced to resign.And in December, further questions were asked about the force when two Met officers were jailed after taking photos of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry and sharing them on WhatsApp.MPs called on the Government to do more to restore public trust. Opening the debate, Lib Dem Sarah Olney said the Independent Office for Police Conductreport into Charing Cross police station, revealed “a number of factors that contributed to the toxic culture they identied”. The MP for Richmond Park said: “These included that officers were often isolated, lacked supervision and that there was widespread acting up, with officers assuming unofficial promotions. “This meant that inappropriate behaviours or attitudes were not properly challenged at the right time and so became normalised. “This strongly suggests that the lack of appropriately experienced or trained police officers has been a contributory factor in allowing negative behaviours to flourish unchecked, which leads back to the dramatic cuts in policing in the capital that we’ve seen over the last decade.” Shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones urged ministers to look at how “we vet police officers” as she argued the process “is not good enough” to actually assess who a person is. She said: “The vetting is not good enough on actually who you are, what you’ve said on social media over the last five years and what you think and whether you should be with vulnerable people. So our vetting needs to be looked at.” On training, the shadow Home Office minister said it needs to be “overhauled”, adding: “Officers need ongoing training throughout their careers, including on anti-racism and including on tackling violence against women and girls.” Conservative former equalities minister Maria Miller stressed the importance of “trying to deal with some of the root causes of the problem”, arguing “we have got to get sex and relationship education ingrained into our schools”. Home Office minister Rachel Maclean recognised policing and the politan Police “must do better” but said the Government is “absolutely committed to raising the bar”. Saying the findings of the IOPC report were “shocking”, adding: “Policing and the Met must do better. And we are absolutely committed to raising the bar.” She went on: “As the public would expect, when officers are found to have committed gross misconduct and dismissed they cannot re-join policing. “And we’re also ensuring that initial police recruitment vetting practices carried out in each force are rigorous and the assessment process addresses the candidate’s suitability for the role of police officer, including testing against core behaviours and values and when officers move force, they are then re-vetted.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON House of CommonsLabour PartyInternational Womens DayDomestic violencePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

NHS workers have been offered a paltry % pay rise by the Tories which is likely to be less than half the rate of inflation. Analysis from the Royal College of Nursing shows a nurse with seven years experience in England is set to lose out by around £ a year once National Insurance and pension changes take effect. The % pay proposal to the NHS Pay Review Body comes after a decade of pay stagnation and below inflation settlements. RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “If the Government does not listen it will be to the detriment of patients when more and more nursing staff decide to leave the profession. “With three months until they are expected to make an announcement, they must listen to people who work in our health and care services.  “When a nurse or health care support worker feels no alternative but to leave, it becomes ever more challenging to provide highly effective care and treatment. They deserve salaries fitting of a safety critical profession. “By summer, ministers must come back with a pay award that turns the tide on the years of unfilled nursing jobs and experienced professionals struggling to make ends meet.” The RCN is calling for a pay award of % above the level of inflation. At the time it made its case, the RPI measure of inflation was running at .%. Its submission to the NHS Pay Review Body demonstrated that from April nursing staff will pay more National Insurance and many will see their pensions contributions increase too. It estimates that a nurse earning £, will be £ worse off this financial year compared to the   when they start paying more National Insurance. Government changes to the NHS pension system will sees these iniduals paying £ a year more into their pension scheme.  The combined impact of bigger pension contributions, and increased National Insurance, takes a further £ away from their net pay compared to last year. The NHS Pay Review Body will hear from interested parties before reporting to ministers in May. The Government will then decide whether to implement its recommendations. The RCN submission highlights recent data from the nursing regulator the Nursing and Midwery Council, showing an % increase in nurses in  compared to . The UK Government indicated in February that its NHS pay funding settlement was assuming a pay award of % to %. The amount set aside for NHS pay in Westminster determines the initial funding available in all parts of the UK, despite devolution of health policy. The NHS Pay Review Bodyprocess runs for England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Direct pay negotiations in Scotland are imminent. It comes as the Government claimed it was on track to meet a pledge to increase total nursing numbers in England by , by . The Department of Health and Social care said overall total nurse numbers now stand at , as of December , compared to , in September .Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “It’s fantastic to see the progress we have made towards our manesto commitment of delivering , more nurses by .“There are now over , more nurses providing exceptional care and treatment for patients across the country every day.” Figures from NHS England show there were , nurse vacancies in December, , more than a year earlier. The Government ordered its MPs to vote down a legal amendment to the Health and Care Bill that would require the NHS to commission independent analysis of staffing numbers needed to care for our aging population. Pat Cullen added: “The number of unfilled nurse jobs has risen in the last year, not fallen. “This workforce crisis with tens of thousands of vacant posts is hitting patient care and adds to waiting lists and treatment delays. “Without transparent publication of workforce data, nursing staff will question these claims. “The Government has not been transparent about how it calculates the numbers genuinely needed for safe and effective “This is a political target in the absence of a proper health and care workforce strategy. “Experienced nursing staff who stayed in the profession during the pandemic are now leaving in greater numbers. “One of the simplest ways to keep more staff is a fair pay rise that recognises their professional skill.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WestminsterNational Insurance Company Ltd.Royal College of NursingNHSNursing and Midwery CouncilBoris JohnsonPat CullenPensionsHealth reformsPoliticsInflation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Around £. billion spent by the Government on useless protective gear was written off by the Government, accounts for   revealed last month.Some £ million worth of equipment was found to be totally unusable, and £ million was spent on items that were not used before their expiry date. Officials are now planning to ship off around , pallets of wasted PPE to power plants to burn each month - around  lorryloads of kit. It comes as part of the latest efforts to claw back huge sums of cash spent battling the virus after Boris Johnson ripped up Englandaposs remaining Covid rules.Jonathan Marron, DHSC director general of office for health improvement and disparities, told the Commons Public Accounts Committee: Weaposre currently appointing to what are called lead waste partners, commercial firms who do this as their business who will help us recycle and weaposre also exploring using it for... waste to provide power. We think we move up to , pallets a month when we get these contracts in place, so a really signicant way of seeing recycling increase and indeed using some of the product to drive power generation. Other examples of recycling PPE included turning visors into food trays and aprons into bin bags, he told MPs. Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: Unbelievable! Remember that £. billion the Department of Health wasted on unusable PPE  They are now burning it. The Tories’ promise to get value for taxpayers’ money has gone up in flames.It comes after the Treasury came under fire for effectively writing off more than £ billion in public cash taken by fraudsters during the pandemic.HMRC figures released in January show £. billion was stolen from pandemic relief schemes such as furlough and self employment support by people who werenapost entitled to claim. An anti-fraud taskforce recovered £ million last year, and it is expecting to recover an additional £ billion. But this means the Treasury only expects to recover £. billion - or £ of every £ taken - by scammers.Boris Johnsonaposs former counter-fraud minister Lord Agnew, who resigned in January over the Government lamentable record, said Covid cash had been frittered on sports cars by company bosses.

The revelation comes as the Home Office announced  Ukrainians have been granted a visa to join UK family out of , applications started - and .million refugees.It is likely to lead to fresh anger after Priti Patel was bombarded with criticism over families who have ended up in Calais. Hundreds of terried Ukrainians have started to arrive in the French port - but they have to submit a visa applicationthey have family in the UK. Currently this involves an in-person trip to Paris - currently the only UK visa centre in France - or Brussels to give fingerprints and other information. Refugees arriving at one centre today were met with the message: NO VISAS DELIVERED IN CALAIS. The Home Secretary sparked chaos today by announcing Ukrainians will also be able to get visas near Calais - but not yet. The Home Secretary told MPs we have set up a bespoke visa application centre en route to the port. But minutes later she claimed she never said that - and in fact the Home Office was still “setting up” the centre.Officials later said even when it opens, it wonapost be for all applicants in France. A Government spokesperson said it will be by referral from Border Force only to support Ukrainians. The primary Visa Application Centre in France will remain in Paris.” Until it does open, it is understood there are  appointments available at the UKaposs Paris Visa Application Centre this week, and  are protected for Ukrainians. Walk-in appointments are also available at the Visa Application Centre in Brussels but only Wednesday to Friday.Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons: “The Home Office website is still telling people to go to Paris. Journalists who are in Calais and looking for any centre that there might be are still unable to find anything. All they can find is a few Home Office staff in a building with a crisp machine but no visas. One family there this afternoon who have been there for five days have been told they cannot get an appointment in Paris until March . “What on earth is going on ” Ms Patel denied families had been unable to get appointments for a week. Home Office sources insisted there was capacity at centres across Europe. Tonight the Home Office confirmed  visas had been issued so far - updating a figure of  by am yesterday, which the Home Office issued but Ms Patel branded “absolutely inaccurate”. Overall, , Ukraine Family Scheme applications had been started. Of these , have been submitted, , have attended a Visa Application Centre, and  applications have been confirmed. It came as a desperate builder spoke of his devastation after rescuing his we and children from Ukraine but being banned from getting them into the UK.Vitalie Turetska has been living and working in north London for the past three years.When Russia started bombing his home country he jumped in his car and drove to the Ukraine Romania border to get we and Helena and sons Danya, six and two-year-old Mapk. They are just some of the . million refugees who have already fled the terror in their home country. But now they are stranded in Calais after British authorities refused to let them cross the Channel. Vitalie said he was told he was allowed tobut he would have to leave his we and kids behind in France because, in his words, they don’t have the correct paperwork.A full family visa scheme for Ukrainians opened on Friday allowing applications from immediate family extended family and immediate family members of extended family.Immediate family are a spouse or civil partner, unmarried partner in a cohabiting relationship for two or more years, a child under , a parenttheir child in the UK is under , or a fiancee or proposed civil partner. Extended family include grown-up children or their parents, grandparents, grandchildren or partners’ grandchildren, and brothers and sisters. Home Office guidance recommends people apply for a visa “in a nearby country” to Ukraine after fleeing over the border - naming Hungary, Moldova, Poland and Romania. People are asked to complete an application online, travel to the visa centre to give details like fingerprints, then remain in the area until their application is processed.

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

Rachael Easter, , from Ipswich, split from her husband in March  and was left in a dire financial situation, facing eviction from her family home and in £, debt. Worried for her -year-old son Jackaposs future, Rachael says she was at rock bottom after the break up and didnapost know where to turn. She said: I was a stay at home we and mother, with no money to my name. I didn’t have a job at the time. We were at risk of eviction. The thought that I couldn’t put a roof over my sonaposs head because I relied on another being devastated me. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereRachael claimed Universal Credit to stop herself and Jack becoming homeless, and received £ a week in food vouchers which was given to low-income families during lockdown.Then, she started looking at her outgoings versus what was coming in every month to try and make a dent in the debt. The debt was from my gas and electric provider, water, bank loan, a sofa, and a credit card, she explained. Rachaelaposs rent is £ per month, plus council tax. She pays £ for water bills and had been paying £ for energy - although this had increased to £. Each month, she would receive £- in Universal Credit payments and every four weeks, sheaposd also get £ in child benefit. While she tried out dferent methods of paying off the debt, Rachael decided she needed to start working, and began offering her services as a self-employed cleaner on Facebook in summer .She charged £ an hour and worked up to  hours some weeks - but in others it could be as few as just five. Her universal credit payments ied depending on how many hours she worked - and last year she earned a total of £, from cleaning, which was topped up to £, with UC. Recalling how she paid of a huge amount of the debt she owed, Rachael said she tried the snowball method. I sorted my household bills first including water, and gas and electricity. I called the companies and with both monthly bills they put my debt on top, she said.Then I used the snowball method to manage it. Which means I paid off the smallest of all the debts first before moving onto the larger debts. Rachael said her motivation for getting the debt paid off on her own was her son Jack - but she worried she was taking on too much at once and had to make huge sacrices. The mum, who doesnapost drive, was so determined to get working that she sometimes walked an hour to and from cleaning jobs. She also started the p challenge, which involved saving a little bit of money every day, starting with a penny. The next day you save two pence, and so on. By the end of a year, youaposll save £. and have a total of £. in savings. She also created online Monzo savings pots for spare money - which she uses for birthdays, Christmas, driving lessons and regular savings. Rachael said: I would move money from my bank to my Monzo pots. Before, I would have just used the money here and there and it would have disappeared. But I’ve been making a conscious effort to put it aside. I’m now also able to give my son pocket money once a week buthe hasnapost done anything to earn it I put it in his Monzo pot to help with a car or deposit when heaposs older. ThenI do an extra cleaning job or have an additional ironing customer, I split what I earn - half onto the debt and half towards my savings. Another way Rachael made up the cash she owed was by selling unused items she had in her house - and thinks this is a great tip for making money quickly. As well as her cleaning job, Rachael set up a side hustle, which she calls her hobby hustle, selling decorated vases with her friend. To keep costs down in her day-to-day le, Rachael draws up meal plans to keep her weekly shop to a minimum and uses vouchers and discounts where she can.While trying to save money, Rachael discovered the debt-free community on Instagram and set up her own page, @getstuffdone_withcoffee to share her progress and top tips.She also uses the page to talk about house cleaning and mental health - and receives plenty of support from her , followers.  I was so embarrassed of my situation and I wanted to improve all aspects of my le so I set up my page, Rachael said. Just  months on from starting her debt-free journey, Rachael had paid of £, of the debt sheaposd accumulated. My house is becoming a home, I have savings, a small amount but more than I have ever had before, debt clearing and a new lease of le, she said, adding sheaposs so proud of what sheaposs achieved. Since becoming more financially independent, Rachael is sure anyone  can manage what she has - particularly single parents. I still have a long way to go but my target for this year  is to become debt free and pass my driving test which will open up more opportunities, she explained. I now have under £ debt left to pay and by the end of the year I will be debt free. As the future is always uncertain with prices of bills and food I am currently looking for a part time job to make sure myself and my boy are secure. ButI can do it, I hope it shows other single parents that they can do it too.

Kennel supervisor Natalie Wood said: “Bella and Lila had led such restricted, sheltered lives and we believe they’d only had very limited time out of their crates, so theyaposd barely experienced the outside world.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. “Their coats were matted and dirty, tangled with urine and faeces. They had fleas, their nails were overgrown, their ears were thick with dirt and their teeth were covered in plaque. Both were displaying extremely fearful behaviours and we were unable to approach them or handle them. They were terried of everything and everyone.”Staff spent weeks gaining the girls’ trust, assessing them and developing rehabilitation plans to help prepare them for new homes.Natalie added: “It took two months until we were able to take Lila out for her first walk off the site, and a further month until Bella would venture outside the safety of the centre with us. That was a huge milestone for us. “After months of slow and gradual work we had a breakthrough in May when Lila, who’d developed a strong bond with our kennel assistant, Lucy, learned to rush over to her when she arrived at her kennel each morning and put her paws onto her shoulders asto give her a hug. It was a beautul moment.Lila - now renamed Jemima - was adopted by Deborah Turpin and her family, from Suffolk, to live with their eight-year-old retired racing greyhound, Sam. They were looking for another dog after losing their border terrier and spotted Jemima’s profile online. “Her video was heartbreaking and I just couldn’t get her out of my mind,” Deborah said. “What she’d been through was unimaginable and I knew we had to give her a chance. We decided to rename her as we wanted her to leave her old le, and her old name, behind her.” The family collected Jemima in October and set about helping her settle in her new home. “She is an absolute dream, she’s such a superstar,” Deborah added. “She has a wonderful personality and is so affectionate. She rushes up to us every morning to give us a cuddle she obviously has six years of cuddles to make up for! We had no idea we needed a little white curly-haired dog as much as we do! “The most enormous credit goes to the team at Martlesham who helped her after what she went through they instilled such confidence in her. We’re overwhelmed by the work that they did with her and how easy they’ve made the process for us. “Now Jemima is becoming quite cheeky and loves to spend time with us. She is so happy, has wonderful manners, and is very clever and eager to learn. She loved her first visit to the beach, enjoys going in the car, and had a fabulous first Christmas. “She is an absolute joy and embraces le with enormous enthusiasm. She has every reason to hate everybody, but she is so happy and is game for everything!” Bella, who was adopted by a family from Scotland, has also settled into her new home. Her new owner said: “Bella is doing really well we feel very fortunate to have her!”To help the RSPCA rescue more animals in need, like Bella and Jemima, please visit www.rspca.org.uk give to donate.

Graphic designer David Benqué, , and his partner Claire OaposBrien, , say they lost £, worth of belongings when a freak flood destroyed their south London flat. They claim they have since spent nearly £, replacing damaged items and relocating - bringing the total spent to £,. The couple says they are furious with Thames Water, who they claim gave them no compensation after a collapsed sewer caused the carnage in September .Thames Water refused legal liability because there were no previous issues with the sewer, therefore they claim they were not negligent, MyLondon reports.  Thames Water also reportedly asked the couple to sign a letter meaning they wonapost pay for aposun-restorableapos items. David and Claire say they refused to sign the letter and had to fork out £, to dispose of the wrecked belongings themselves. David said: I was alerted to the sound and the smell, something did not seem right. I saw a torrent of water. The pipe that exploded was under a bin so there was a bunch of rubbish floating.  I opened the door and saw the whole staircase was like a waterfall. I closed the door and for a couple of seconds, my brain said it would be fine. Then I knew it was not going to be okay so I woke my partner up. Once Claire was awake they grabbed the children, their teddies and put an iPad up high. David said he got his coat and laptop, but the computer later fell into the sludge.  David recalled: The water was coming through the door so we thought it was time to go out, then the door opened and let a torrent of sewage in. Our furniture started floating and then it got pretty intense.The fire brigade arrived as the water was filling the basement.David added: I was carrying my five-year-old, I saw the firefighters so I crawled so they could see us. They helped my partner who was carrying the three-year-old and she could not walk forward the pressure was so strong, so he was carried by a fireman.  The coupleaposs flat wasnapost the only one affected and other neighbours were rescued from their windows because the water pressure was so strong. By the next day, the extent of the damage could be seen and the costs started to mount up. Thames Water said the family was not eligible for the hardship fund. David said: We are lucky we have family and friends that are able to help us, but we are broke as hell now. There were lots of upsetting moments but when you walk into your flat and see a book your kidsapos like and itaposs covered in muck. You could see stuff that was familiar but itaposs all in the wrong place and everything is covered. Then we realised they were not going to give us any money at all. Textile designer Claire said: Now the time has passed it was actually a really traumatic event to be woken up to a torrent of water rushing into your home. The trauma of seeing how much water was in our flat, just filled up like a bath. Itaposs been really dficult just the devastation, the time and stress to get back on our feet and have nothing from Thames Water. We feel like criminals that do not matter when itaposs their pipe that exploded on our lives. A few hours earlier it could have been a very dferent story but it was still pretty terrying. The fact that it was sewage water, itaposs toxic. The kidsapos stuff is sentimental, they still talk about it all the time. It makes you think lots of people would not be able to get back on their feet. That really stuck with me, the utter devastation, everything gone within five minutes. Itaposs a terrible thing for your family to go through. Itaposs not our fault, or climate change, itaposs Thames Water. A Thames Water spokesperson told The Mirror: “We understand how distressing sewer flooding is and we sympathise with anyone affected. “In this case, the flooding was caused by a collapsed sewer which caused sewage to spill out into nearby properties. Our engineers were quickly on the scene and carried out repairs as a matter of urgency. Investigations show there were no previous issues with the sewer which would have contributed to the collapse, and as such Thames Water was not negligent and is not legally liable for the damage caused. “As with all sewer flooding, we offered to clean and sanitise affected properties, which includes removing belongings which are too damaged to be ed to the property. In order to do this, we ask our customers to sign a document acknowledging that we won’t be reimbursing them for the items removed. “We encourage anyone affected by the devastating impact of sewer flooding to make a claim through their home insurance provider.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Thames Water PLCiPadClimate changeHouse insuranceFloods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

WhatCar reports that drivers are banned from parking their cars against the flow of traffic as the reflectors would not be picked up by oncoming vehiclesParking your car the wrong way at night could incur a hefty fine Image: Getty ImagesByAriane Sohrabi-ShirazSEO EditorLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Jan Updated:,  Mar |commentsA little known Highway Code rule could see motorists slapped with a fine between £, and £, -they park against the flow of traffic at night time. WhatCar, an automobile magazine, reports that drivers are actually banned from parking their cars against the direction of traffic unless there’s a marked out parking space. Even the most disciplined driver could be forgiven for not knowing this unusual fact. The Highway Code lists under Rule  that a car must not be parked at the side of the road facing against the direction of traffic unless in a recognised parking space”. If it is, then you could be breaking the law.This is because parking facing the traffic on unlit roads can be extremely dangerous, according to car scrapping comparison site, scrapcarcomparison. This means it could be harder for other motorists to detect what you are doing, potentially leading to crashes.  Cars parked in the same direction of traffic will have the rear reflectors illuminated. A spokesman said: Motors parked the correct way would be visible and illuminated by headlights bouncing off the rear reflectors. We’ve dealt with cars that have been written-off due to a passing car crashing into them as they have partly stuck out from a parking space. For most vehicles, the offence could cost around £,, whereas for eight-seaters, this jumps to £,. However, drivers donapost need to worry about this during the day, but as it gets darker it could become an issue. Another sloppy parking habit has seen motorists fined for leaning slightly over the edge of a parking bay - an expensive start to the year and unwelcome surprise after Christmas. Leaving your car stationary in a parking bay should be a fairly straightforward process - but you can actually get finedyou donapost stick to the rules.As the Mirror reported last year, a driver left the side of his car protruding slightly over the bay line in Birmingham City Centre, encroaching on the space next door. He was charged £ for doing so. The fine - which would be reduced to £paid within  days - was issued by private firm Premier Parking Enforcement LTD who are contracted by building management company Remus.

Panitzke was caught last Sunday as she walked her dogs in Santa Barbara, between ­Barcelona and Valencia. The head of the elite ­Fugitive Task Force squad which nabbed her told yesterday of her disguise and dramatic escape in . He said: “It was like ­something out of a film.  “She appeared by her door to smoke and one officer passed by to get a closer look. “She saw him and changed her clothes, donned a wig and a small rucksack before heading for the mountains beside the house a few moments later. “It’s very rare to find people as prepared as she was.” He revealed after her arrest Panitzke, who had been living under the alias Maria ­Antonietta, claimed she felt she had already done her time, having lived in isolation for so many years.

She is in prison near Madrid, fighting extradition.

Fire crew have been asked to work on the baggage belts and travellers complained of massive lines at security that took hours to get through, it has been claimed.Queues at check-in desks were described as beyond a joke causing some people to miss their flights and leaving others in tears on Monday. It marked the second day of delays at the international hub amid staff shortages which saw some passengers stuck on the runway for two-and-a-half hours.One airport worker told the Manchester Evening News : “It’s been so bad that they have been asking firefighters, engineers and parking staff to offload the bags onto the conveyors in the arrivals hall. “I think the summer is going to be horrendous, at this rate we just won’t have the staff, and morale is already low. I just hope that we get the staff we need in time and get back to normal. One woman said her flight to Gran Canaria with TUI departed more than two hours late due to delays getting the baggage on the plane. Kathleen Moorland said she was still sitting on the plane on the runway at .pm, when it was meant to be departing at .am.She added that there were delays getting through queues at the airport, despite arriving more than three hours before her flight. Kathleen said: TUI and Manchester Airport, a total farce and joke. All you want is an easy start to your holiday - not the total chaos that there is. Julia Teale tweeted: @manairport. You really need to sort your staffing issues. Just witnessed people missing flights who have been here three hours but security was so disorganised it’s taking hours to get through. If it’s like this in March what will it be like in high season. Not enough staff.  Martijn van der Voort also tweeted: When will @manairport @AndyBurnhamGM @ManCityCouncil grasp that the airport is one of the worst in the world  From rude security staff to long queues to poor infrastructure and parking. Truly terrible airport and I have been to many across the globe. On Sunday, passengers were also faced with ridiculous two-hour queues amid a workforce shortage, sparking fears of more chaos for passengers in the busy summer ahead. It is estimated that more than , redundancies were made at Manchester Airport as the aviation sector was savaged by the pandemic. This included around  workers employed directly by the hub and more than , by outside employers like baggage handling agents and airlines.Now travel restrictions are lting, passenger numbers are on the rise and plans to reopen Terminal  are also in the pipeline. But questions have been raised as to whether the workforce can meet demand in what Manchester Airport bosses have described as an extremely challenging labour market. Airport bosses apologised over long delays and horrendous queues at passport control on Friday. A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said queues on both days were due to a greater number of passengers than expected. Passengers have been urged to get to the airport at least three hours before their scheduled flight time.

Kate and William met during their first year at the University of St Andrews, where they were both enrolled on the same course and lived in the same residence halls. Walks to class brought them together and soon they fell head over heels for each other.William was going through a dficult time in the early stages of their relationship, but Kate was there to support him every step of the way, says Angela Levin, author of Harry: Biography of a Prince.Speaking on True Royalty TV aposs Royal Beat, she explains: I think that Kate has helped save William. I think it was very dficult for him coming out of a dysal family, losing his mum so young and I think he was in a very dficult place.

She said: She has really encouraged him. Her whole le is to make him happy, I think. She found things that really make him feel important and worthy rather than just going to cut ribbons. I think she has helped him to be a husband by introducing him to her own family a lot and spending time with a normal family and being a dad.Kate and William met when they were  years old and it wasnapost long before the attractive and bubbly brunette caught Williamaposs eye. Royal author Tom Quinn has previously recalled: One of the funny stories is he was so desperate to meet her that as he walked towards her, he apparently tripped and said, aposOh thataposs a terrible start, youaposre going to think Iaposm a complete clot. However, it was Kateaposs now-legendary appearance in a charity fashion show in March  that kicked off their romance. William reportedly paid £ for a front-row ticket for the catwalk event, where Kate wore nothing but a sheer stocking dress over black underwear. As she strutted her way past the prince, William is said to have turned to his friend Fergus Boyd and whispered: Wow, Fergus, Kateaposs hot! Fast forward  years and the pair are married and have three beautul children, Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, six, and Prince Louis, three.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

With the focus of the day on this, it is no wonder that some people have been reminded that Mothering Sunday is only around the corner, as people looking forward to showing their appreciation for their mum and everything she has done for them So when is Motheraposs Day  When is Motheraposs Day   Motheraposs Day this year falls on Sunday, March . The term aposMotheraposs Dayapos technically means the day dedicated to the celebration of mums everywhere, whereas Mothering Sunday tended to refer to a Christian tradition that began in the th century where people would visit either the church they grew up in or were baptised.  The dates for the next few years are as follows: - March   - March   - March   - March Why does the Motheraposs Day date change   The celebration falls on the fourth Sunday in Lent and the date changes depending on Easter and the Christian calendar. Easter and Lent changes every year depending on the cycle of the moon and means that Easter Sunday can occur on any Sunday between March  and April  Motheraposs Day shouldnapost be confused with the day in the US, which falls in May and has ious sources that helped to set it up. Why do we celebrate Motheraposs Day   There are ious reasons we celebrate Motheraposs Day, but it is now seen as a chance to be grateful to our mum for everything they have done for us over the years Until recently it was more commonly known as aposMothering Sundayapos. There were ancient Greek festivals that celebrated motherhood as well in honour of their god Rhea and festivals were also held by the Romans, so the tradition is nothing new. In Europe and the UK, a special service would see people ing to their aposmother churchapos during Lent. Like with other Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, the day has become more of a secular tradition and widely commercialised.  In the US, abolitionist and suffragette Julia Ward Howe set up Mothers’ Friendship Day in the wake of the American Civil War in  to promote reconciliation with the mothers of Union and Confederate troops. In fact, Anna Jarvis, who pushed for the idea for Motheraposs Day to be celebrated in the US as part of the national calendar, eventually criticised the commercialisation of the day and lobbied to have it removed. Jarvis was the daughter of Ann Reeves Jarvis, who had set up work clubs for mums to come together. Anna had originally campaigned to have it as part of the national calendar and President Woodrow Wilson officially added it in .

CEPI will invest up to £million towards a version of mRNA technology already used in Moderna and Pfizer jabs that could be quickly modied to target new pathogens. Mr Johnson said: “The UK is proud to have committed to a quarter of a billion pounds to support CEPI at the start of the pandemic, because it was precisely the partnership between CEPI, government, industry and academia which helped our vaccines to triumph over the virus.  “And now, we must come together to support CEPI’s global plan for the next generation of vaccine technologies, such as the new iant-proof vaccine being developed at Cambridge University to help protect us against the next Covid iant, or indeed, against the next pandemic.” DIOSynVax, a university spin-off company, is working with the structure of proteins, computational biology and on boosting the immune system to work out how vaccines can be used to their best effect. If the plan works, experts believe that vaccines could rapidly be developed against “Disease X” - unknown pathogens that have yet to emerge but which could cause pandemics.Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI, said: “The UK Government and the country’s world-leading scientic institutions have been pivotal to the global response to Covid-. “From the development of the CEPI-supported Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine - which is used in more countries than any other - to the ground-breaking Recovery trial to evaluate le-saving treatments like dexamethasone, British science has played a leading role in protecting the world from Covid-. “I am excited to further strengthen CEPI’s strong ties to British science through this partnership with DIOSynVax.” Professor Jonathan Heeney, chief executive of DIOSynVax, said: “Our approach is to be ahead of the next pandemic. “To deliver custom-designed, immune selected vaccine antigens - which is ideal to prevent diseases caused by complex viruses such as the large and erse family of coronaviruses. “If successful, it will result in a safe, affordable NextGen vaccine for widespread use.” England’s chief medical officer, Professor Sir Chris Whitty, told the CEPI conference the world had had many “near misses” with pandemics, and preparation for the next one was key.

It had been suggested that Harry and Meghan wanted to compromise with a one foot in, one foot out solution to being working royals and chasing their own financial deals.However, following the so-called Sandringham Summit between Harry, the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, it was decided they should cut ties completely.And now former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt says more could have been done to keep Harry and Meghan in the Firm - especially as Meghan could have been an asset to them. He told the: She was able to give a speech in South Africa about being a woman of colour who entered an institution that, to survive and prosper, needs to continue being the head of state in several other realms which are Commonwealth countries, and it failed to do enough to keep her within the institution.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

They’ve managed to find a mechanism whereby [civilian] Prince Edward can attend the Cenotaph wearing a military unorm. They could have found a mechanism whereby Harry could have carried on. The fact that they didn’t smacks of a level of cruelty.”His comments come as Harry made a surprise appearance at a Texas rodeo - and came dressed for the occasion wearing a cowboy hat. Harry was spotted at the Stockyards Rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas, on Saturday - a famous rodeo where contestants ride bulls and take part in roping competitions. He was at the event without Meghan and was seen chatting to people attending the rodeo and was given a tour of the venue.Harryaposs appearance at the rodeo comes two weeks after his and Meghanaposs last public outing at the NAACP Image Awards, where they were awarded the prestigious Presidentaposs Award to mark their special achievement for aposdistinguished public serviceapos.Accepting the award, Harry said: I think itaposs safe to say that I come from a very dferent background from my incredible we, yet our lives were brought together for a reason.

Syllipsimopodi bideni was armed with two more limbs than its descendants today. It roamed the oceans  million years ago. Additional appendages would have made it a more efficient predator, say the team at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.The species was unearthed at the Mississippian Bear Gulch in Montana - one of the best preserved fossil sites in the world.It was a primitive vampire squid. They do not suck or drink blood but have dark skin that connects the arms - resembling a cape. The discovery sheds fresh light on evolution - pushing back the age of the group by nearly  million years.What do you make of squid Joe Biden  Have your say in the comment section Lead author Dr Christopher Whalen said: This is the first and only known vampyropod to possess ten al appendages. The paper was submitted for publication in Nature Communications around the time of the  year-old US presidentaposs inauguration. Dr Whalen said: I wanted to somehow acknowledge the moment in a way that was more positive and forward-looking. I was encouraged by the plans President Biden put forward to counter anthropogenic climate change, and his general sentiment that politicians should listen to scientists. Vampyropods are the ancestors of vampire squid and octopae. Their origins are unclear. Modern descendants have eight arms and two big eyes - enabling them to survive in pitch black waters near the bottom of the ocean. Octopae and squid can reach  and  feet long respectively - and weigh half a ton.  S. bideni was less than five inches showing they started out small - before becoming very big. Its remains are exceptionally important. The soft-bodied nature of cephalopods mean they rarely fossilise. Co-author Professor Neil Landman said: Syllipsimopodi may have filled a niche more similar to modern squids, a mid-level aquatic predator. It is not inconceivable it might have used its sucker-laden arms to pry small ammonoids out of their shells or ventured more inshore to prey on brachiopods, bivalves or other shelled marine animals. S. bideni was dug up in the s and donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada where it has resided ever since - without previously being described. After scanning the specimen Dr Whalen and Prof Landman realised it was a completely new genus - and the oldest cephalopod on record. It corroborates previous arguments that their common ancestor had ten arms.Dr Whalen said: The arm count is one of the defining characteristics separating the -armed squid and cuttlefish line from the eight armed octopus and vampire squid line. We have long understood that octopuses achieve the eight arm count through elimination of the two filaments of vampire squid, and that these filaments are vestigial arms. However, all previously reported fossil vampyropods preserving the appendages only have  arms. So this fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed ten arms. Two of S. bideniaposs arms appear to have been elongated relative to the other eight. Its torpedo-shaped body is reminiscent of todayaposs squids. The genus name is Greek for aposprehensile footapos because it is the oldest known cephalopod to develop suckers. They allowed the arms - modications of the molluscan foot - to better grasp prey and other objects. Added Dr Whalen: The findings present a revised and more detailed analysis of vampyropod evolution than previously possible. Joe Biden was inaugurated on  January last year. He is the th president of the United States. A host of strange animals have been named after his predecessors - including the tiny moth Neopalpa donaldtrumpi. The insectaposs yellow-and-white crown bore a striking resemblance to Donald J. Trumpaposs distinctive cofure. Baracktrema obamai is a species of flatworm that is meant to honour Barack Obama. The parasitic wasp Heterospilus washingtoni is named after George Washington, a tiny shrew Heterospilus washingtoni hails Theodore Roosevelt - and there is the bluegrass darter Etheostoma jimmycarter. Others include the beaded darter Etheostoma clinton after Bill Clinton and the wasp Heterospilus reagani after Ronald Reagan.

The interaction starts out calmly enough but when the postie’s new helper decides to steal one of his letters, things quickly escalate. The mischievous black and white bird was caught on camera using its beak to pick up a first class-stamped envelope. But the winged mailman struggled to find the right address as he was pursued by the local postie called Rob. The minute-long footage, captured in Leiston, Suffolk, initially shows the magpie perched innocently on top of the postmanaposs red trolley used to transport mail.  As the bird curiously pecks at letters and parcels, postman Rob tries to shoo it away. He says: Excuse me, hello  What do you think youaposre doing  Shoo! Youaposre going to get me in trouble, go on, go away. But the stubborn magpie holds its ground as it accepts Robaposs offer of a ride on his electronic trolley to the next address.  The bird appears unphased as it then tries to pick up a white envelope sitting on top of a pile of mail. Hesitantly, Rob says: The thing is, I need the letter youaposre perched on, Iaposve got to deliver that. Can I just have that please  But the magpie retaliates with a peck as the postie tries to pick up the letter - and instead grabs the mail itself and runs for it. Rob chases after the bird as it dashes towards the next address. He says: Give me that back, give it here! Now thataposs naughty. Finally, the bird drops the letter and instead decides to perch on a house window ledge, allowing Rob to continue with his delivery.

Mr McKeague, of Dunfermline, Fe, was  when he vanished in the early hours of September   after a night out in the Suffolk town.The airman was stationed at RAF Honington, more than eight miles from Bury St Edmunds. No trace of him has been found since a last sighting on CCTV at .am entering a service area behind a Greggs store, and Suffolk Police believe he climbed into a bin which was then tipped into a waste lorry. Alicia Gallagher, giving evidence to an inquest in Ipswich by video link, said she first met Mr McKeague on a night out in Bury St Edmunds in December .She said she was with her sister at Flex nightclub and saw a number of people who were in smart dress formal wear, like tuxes. One of them was on his own, she said. We were just out dancing really and he stayed with us for a couple of hours until closing. She continued: He was actually just really friendly. He wasnapost flirty. He was just really sociable - it was like he was looking for people to chat to.  She said that when they left, at around .am, she was taking a taxi with her sister in a dferent direction from Mr McKeague. My sister was concerned he wasnapost going home with anyone, said Ms Gallagher. We offered him some money for a taxi - he did mention a base but he didnapost say which base it was. He said he walked... one time which my sister wasnapost happy with. In the end I think he just wandered off.She continued: He said he had done it before, which I remember as we talked about it in the taxi home and said aposthataposs so farapos. Itaposs something I remember from that night as I thought aposthataposs so far, I wouldnapost do thatapos, but then Iaposm not a young, fit male either. It was a striking point that he mentioned walking home, that he had done it before. She said she saw Mr McKeague a second time on September   in Wetherspoons in Bury St Edmunds. She said she was with a friend for a casual drink when Mr McKeague, who did not recognise her, pulled up a chair. Ms Gallagher said he was very friendly, very confident. She said when she recognised him she found a video of him with her sister on the previous night out, showed it to him, then sent her sister a Snapchat video of Mr McKeague saying hello. She said he left after a few minutes. Aaron Figge, who worked in the Spar shop at RAF Honington, said in a statement that Mr McKeague bought a bottle of vodka from the shop on Friday, September  . He said Mr McKeague was among his regular customers who he became friendly with, describing him as a very happy, chatty person who was always well-presented and seemed a nice guy. I was aware he lived on the base as he was a regular customer, he said.  He asked to see ious bottles of vodka and while choosing he chatted to me, said Mr Figge. He stated he had not had a good day at work - this was not usual for Corrie as he was usually so upbeat. He said he believed Mr McKeague bought a cl bottle of Spar vodka, the cheapest bottle in the store, for between £ and £, and also bought cigarettes, paying by card. We said bye to each other and he left the shop, he said. The inquest, due to last for up to four weeks, continues.

Speaking on Evan Haferaposs Black Rle Coffee Podcast in the US, the decorated hero said: In the back of my mind Iaposm like aposIaposve been shot, thataposs coolapos, then thereaposs like aposI hope I donapost lose my armapos. Speaking with a hint of his Geordie accent, he went on: This is the strange thing. Now it hurt badly. When it goes through that bone. And I get it when people say when they get shot, they donapost feel it. I completely buy into thatit doesnapost go through a bone.  But once it goes through a bone and shatters it, it hurts. It was like banging your funny bone and times by ,. Thataposs what it felt like. But hereaposs the messed-up bit. Going back into junior para, being indoctrinated and things, there was a sense of satisfaction. It was like, aposoh, Iaposve just been shot, thataposs pretty coolapos. In the back of my mind, Iaposm like aposIaposve been shot, thataposs cool, then thereaposs like aposI hope I donapost lose my armapos. And my arm was hanging by the triceps but, having some medical knowledge. I could wriggle my fingers.And in my mind, again just thinking, thataposs not that bad because I can wriggle my fingers. In my mind, I was thinking, aposIaposm going to keep my armapos. He suffered a shattered humerus and now has a titanium rod implanted from his elbow to shoulder. Craighead added: I think most young soldiers, maybe, you kind of want to get shot because itaposs like a thing isnapost it, like aposoh Iaposve been shotapos. Itaposs a be careful what you wish for, isnapost it. And you kind of want it to happen, you want to be tested. And sometimes death is a price where you say aposdo you know what, I donapost mind dyingapos.  I think there are lots of people who havenapost seen combat who wouldaposve said aposI will sacrice my le to experience that combatapos. I think thataposs part of training, mindset, everything that comes to it. Craighead, who joined the army in  as a -year-old, was pictured in January  during the Nairobi hotel siege. He was in Kenya on a SAS mission to train local forces and was relaxing off-duty when Somali-based Al Shabaab militants attacked the Dusit D complex.He raced to the scene in his civvies, pulled on a camouflage flak jacket, then led a counter-attack armed with a Colt Canada C assault rle, Glock  pistol and combat kne. Wearing a balaclava and heavily armed, he almost single-handedly defeated jihadis, rescuing dozens. The -hour siege left  people dead, including British charity worker Luke Potter. It was only last year, Craighead, who won a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, the UKaposs second-highest medal for his heroics, unmasked himself so he could publish an account of how he ended the terror attack. His move came after people kept impersonating him on social media and in pubs near the SASaposs Hereford base. Craigheadaposs decision to unmask himself sparked deep concern among senior or defence officials, worried he may reveal details of the missions he was involved in. Under strict rules, Special Forces troops must not discuss their operations publicly and seek to make money from revealing their details. The rules follow the furore over books by ex-troopers Chris Ryan and Andy McNab, which raised the SASapos public profile and led to concerns over Special Forces troops leaking sensitive information which could compromise future operations. Craigheadaposs book on the siege called One Man In: The Explosive Firsthand Account of the Lone Special-Ops Soldier Who Fought Off a Major Terrorist Attack in Kenyaapos, is expected to be published in June next year.Discussing the MOD rules and confidentiality issues, he said: Iaposm working with the Ministry of Defence as we speak to do it properly, to release this book, so thereaposs no sense of information or anything.So thataposs as far as Iaposm willing to talk about my le in the nd Special Air Service Regiment. I should add that the book is just about that one day, so for anyone on the edge of their seats, it doesnapost talk about anything I did while serving in the unit. It just talks about one thing I did that we all know I did. The Newcastle-born hero currently spends much of his time in the States as he is engaged to Donald Trumpaposs chief White House photographer Shealah Craighead.

Linzi and Lee Steer, who run Project reveal - Ghosts of Britain say their latest capture is the clearest image they have taken in their decades of ghost hunting experience. The couple from Rotherham, who have over  years of paranormal research experience between them, have snapped what many of their fans believe is an apparition in the form of a ghostly face.The experienced investigators live stream all their hunts and they were alerted to the spooky visage when fans spotted it on a Facebook clip,Yorkshire Live reports. I just canapost get over it. It is so clear and distinctive, said Linzi. The pair spotted the photo after a visit to Inveraray Jail.The couple, who go on daily ghost hunts, live-stream all of their investigations on Facebook and ask viewers to screenshot any unusual sightings. But when they looked back at the photos from their trip to the Scottish jail and courtroom, they were left shocked. A figure can be seen behind a waxwork model in multiple screenshots, according to Linzi. While she said she could not see the figure while she was filming, she has been left unable to explain what her viewers saw. Linzi said: We try to debunk everything, but thereaposs no dummy there in that particular area.  She added: It is definitely not human. If it was one of us you could tell with the colouring, but it looked very transparent. The apparent figure wasnapost the only spooky part of their trip either. Husband Lee revealed he had an unnerving experience when looking around the siteaposs jail blocks. I walked into one of them and I felt a tickling sensation on my throat, and it started to get more intense to the point where I had to run outside, he said. Although they didnapost know it at the time, the couple were later told by staff that many people have reported feeling a choking sensation in the same spot. Lee added: That is the first time Iaposve ever felt that kind of thing. Iaposm actually sceptical when it comes to ghosts.You can see the screenshots for yourself and see more of the investigatorsapos work here.

Jay Curtis, , stumbled upon the interesting find late last year when he noticed the network tucked away in the countryside in Brackla, Bridgend.And when the explorer, from Wales, investigated the area he found nuclear blast doors, as well as an air filtration system, generator and water and diesel storage. The bunkers also housed eight secret magazine tunnels that were built to protect the high explosives held within the Brackla Munitions Factory, where , people worked during the Second World War. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Jay explored the area and shared the find on his YouTube channel, Jay Curtis Explores, where he said: “Now this place might look like any ordinary industrial estate, but with the imminent Second World War upon Britain this place became one of the most secretive places in South Wales – and there’s plenty of other hidden history left overyou know where to look. “Inside the bunker is a maze of rooms for personnel, beds, a canteen, recreation, offices, communication centres – you name it. This bunker remains locked and forgotten in the hillside.”The Royal Ordnance Factory stopped production of the explosives in  and the site was left abandoned until the s, when the Ministry of Defenceturned part of the site into a nuclear command bunker for South Wales.While the bunker appears totally abandoned and reclaimed by nature, with leaves and plants growing up around it, Jay revealed it still has its own power supply.  Jay added: “You can tell by the well-maintained road and new locks that this place is very much still in use.” It is currently not clear who is using the site, but it has previously been used as a filming location for Doctor Who and Torchwood, where the crew was allowed access to film episodes featuring the iconic Cybermen villains. According to Jay, everything inside the locked bunkers remains “in full working order”. Standing outside the entrance, Jay explained: “That bizarre-looking square building behind me was in fact originally a magazine tunnel entrance, but this new entrance was added with the imminent threat of a nuclear attack – hence the air filtration system, the generator inside, the water and the diesel storage, and a series of nuclear blast doors.”  The magazine tunnels are also still intact and “scattered across the landscape”. Jay said: “Many have been filled in but two or three entrances above ground give an idea of what a secretive past this hillside once had. It’s in these dark magazine tunnels that thousands upon thousands of tonnes of explosives would be piled high to the ceiling, hidden away from the enemy and the threat from above.” And further down the hillside, Jay found the remains of more tunnels, with the main access and ventilation shafts now filled in.  Speaking after sharing his video, he said: “It was a complete surprise to find this as I went looking for evidence of the former munitions factory tunnels and did not expect to stumble across the bunkers in the woods. The feeling below ground was very eerie. You could hear nothing from le above ground. “The damp environment within the bunker offered little resemblance to its signicant past – just a chemical toilet, cupboard, some BT junction box and wiring, and the remains of the water pump could be found inside.”Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viralproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chey, who goes by the name @cumminschey on TikTok, has taken to the app to share a photo of the adorable inking she wanted, compared to what she actually received.The trainee teacher, from Ohio in the United States, revealed that the tattoo artist even drew a stencil of the artwork she wanted on her skin before doing the tattoo, yet it still turned out completely dferent. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Didn’t they stencil it before to show you the design  a follower questioned, to which Chey replied: Yes but it looked completely opposite. Worst Iaposve spent, she wrote alongside the clip, which been watched nearly , times. One TikTok user commented: The detail and colour is amazing but this was NOT what you were going for lmao I get where youaposre coming from Iaposve had the same thing happen... Weaposve got to normalise being comfortable bringing up our issues with the stencil before they start, another added. A third wrote: These are two completely dferent concepts. In a follow up clip, it appears to show the tattoo having been covered up, although its unclear what design Chey decided to go with instead.

Plus, rarely in le do we actually try one type of tea bag directly after the other, unless youaposre at some sort of fancy tea tasting experience, and so itaposs sometimes dficult to discern which brand actually comes out on top. With this in mind, I decided to pit five iconic tea brands against each other, in what I promise is far more than just a very cheeky excuse to nab a particularly y tea break at work.I sampled bags from Tetleyaposs, Yorkshire Tea, PG Tips, Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend and Twinings, ranking each one in terms of all-important factors such as flavour, moreish-ness and, of course, how well they take a good biscuit dunking.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. PG Tips -  ******* £. from the Co-op for  bags of teaFirst things first, I went for a slug of PG Tips fas this has become, for whatever reason, my tried and trusted bag of choice in recent years, a brand which I chuck in the basket without really thinking too much about it.However, this just goes to show that you should branch out every now and then when it comes to your store cupboard staples, with this household name not quite hitting the mark when compared to its fellow tea break giants. PG Tips doesn’t quite pack the same powerful punch as other teas, and I noticed a slightly thin, watery taste when compared with more flavourful options. Despite not making too much of an impact on me, this is still an enjoyable drink, with no lingering unpleasant aftertaste. I also found that the more subtle notes made it ideal for biscuit dipping.Twinings - .  ********   £. Tesco for pack of Being at the pricier end of the spectrum, I would usually only plump for TwiningsI spied it on offer somewhere. Given that it does feel rather more suited to afternoon scones with the Queen than a rushed, microwaved job ahead of mid-week Zoom calls, it doesnapost exactly feel in sync with my day-to-day le.However, that said, this is a very good quality tea, and one that I donapost mind buying every now and then as a special treat. Of course, I had to sip it from my fanciest Jane Austen Museum china cup, like the lady I am and was pleased as ever by the light flavours and comforting toastiness. One of the more distinctive teas on the market, Twinings doesnapost have the same bitterness that spoils so many other products. But it narrowly misses out on the top spot given that the perfumed notes may get a little cloying after a few brew rounds. It felt wrong to submerge a biscuit in this one, but I had a good go anyway.Tetleys - .  ******   £. for  tea bags at Tesco Iaposve never personally been a Tetleyaposs drinker, and canapost say that Iaposve ever bought a bag myself as an adult. However, I have some vague memories of collecting the little figurine men as a kid, so the bag did infuse a bit of nostalgia.Admittedly, I was a little disappointed after going in for a gulp, and have to say that Iaposm somewhat surprised that this brand is as popular as it is, being the leading tea brand in UK convenience and independent grocery stores as of , according to Statistica. To be perfectly honest, I found Tetleyaposs to have quite a bitter, earthy taste which may well take a little getting used to for those used to smoother beverages. There was also quite a gravelly, dentistaposs waiting room-esque aftertaste that I would have expected from a lesser-known, cheaper label. I didnapost bother to dunk.Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend -   ******** p for a pack of  at AldiI love Aldi and do the majority of my recipe shopping there, but this is the first time Iaposve gone for a bag of Aldiaposs own tea.Although I do like to be adventurous with my food, Iaposm a stickler for habit when it comes to tea and coffee brands, and - I must say - Iaposve learned a lesson on this front.I opted for a pack of Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend and was immediately impressed by the pretty scenic packaging, which looks a far cry from what youaposd typically imagine a discount box of tea to look like. However, the most pleasant surprise of all was the quality taste, with mellow, rounded mouthfuls making for a very satisfying - and biscuit-worthy - post-sht pick-me-up. Being by far the best bang for your buck, this makes for a thrty swap likely to please even the pickiest of tea drinkers.  Yorkshire Tea -   ********** £. at the Co-op for  tea bagsAs Iaposve said, Iaposve mostly drunk PG Tips in recent times, but Iaposve previously been a Yorkshire Tea drinker through and through. This taste test made me wonder why Iaposd ever bothered to swap. Classic, hearty, and above all reassuring, Yorkshire Tea is a hardy brew built to weather the ious storms in le, and I knew it wouldnapost disappoint.Strong, yet moreish, flavourful but not overwhelming, this is the tea Iaposd opt for in a desert island scenario, knowing that it comforts me in my loneliest moments. In all honesty, the only reason Iaposm not giving this king of teas a solid ten out of ten is that Iaposm sure thereaposs some independent tea shop in some country village somewhere that might have just pipped it to the post. However,there is, Iaposm yet to find it. After some consideration, there can be no worthier winner than Yorkshire Tea, quite rightly voted as the UKaposs favourite brand last year in a poll by Tea and Coffee .The ever-elegant Twinings was my second runner-up, with Aldiaposs Diplomat Gold Blend coming in a very respectable third. My old go-to PG Tips didnapost quite compare, ranking fourth in the list, while Tetleys was my least favourite of the bunch.Do you have a food or drink-related story to tell  We pay for stories.

When I saw it I told them it was just a toy. I moved it lightly with my foot and it didnapost move. When my kid turned on the bathroom light, it started moving and I s*** myself. Itaposs skinny but itaposs huge, You find spiders and flies in your house, not a f*****g snake. Kayleigh closed the bathroom door and placed down a towel, covering the small gap between the door and the floor, before comforting her children and putting them to bed.  By the time she went back into the bathroom, she saw the snake go behind the back of her toilet. She continued: I saw it go behind the toilet and I havenapost seen it since.

But instead of being silently creepy like she had hoped, her phone decided to plot against her - as she accidentally triggered the GPS within the map and a robotic voice told the entire office she was planning to head to her co-workeraposs house. In a post titled, To have done the most embarrassing thing ever, she explained: This happened about an hour ago and I think I need to go home and never come back to the office again. I work with a very very very handsome man. He was on the phone in the office this morning trying to sort out someone to come and fix his boiler. He happened to say his postcode and I, being the creepy wee lady I am, put it into maps on my phone to see where he lived.  For some reason, and I still donapost know why, my phone blared out: Starting route from aposcurrent locationapos to aposhandsome manaposs postcodeapos. I was  feet away in a quiet office. He turned to look and I couldn’t even look up for wanting the ground to swallow me whole. How do I come back from this  Commenters on the Mumsnet post were sympathetic to the mumaposs hilarious blunder, with many of them suggesting she style it out by just pretending her Siri picked up on his voice. One person said: Oh my god thataposs horrendous and something that would happen to me so I am dying for you. Definitely Siriaposs fault! As another suggested: Style it out. Siri must have picked him up saying his postcode. Really must remember to lock your phone before you put it in your bag... While others attempted to make her feel better by sharing their own embarrassing romance stories. Someone posted: Years ago, I was texting my friend about this boy I really liked and accidentally sent it to him. A few days later I saw him and he asked meI had something to tell him, and I said no and left it at that.

When asked by her followers how she ended up living in the accommodation, the woman explained that the town decided to open up the free apartments due to a lack of rental properties in the area. Because of the nature of my job, I need to be at work. And I travel a lot but it was impossible to find housing. So this town has a lot of people who come here for that reason, and they had no housing other than low income, she explained. So they started allowing people to live in their old folks home because it was one of their only rental units that would have openings.

The colour looked a lot darker on the picture online and the material seemed like it would be a lot thicker over certain areas. The only similarities were the patterns on the dress, but other than it was nothing like I expected. I sent it to my friends and they all got a bit of a laugh out of it.

The United Nations has formally acknowledged the day since  as a recognition of the struggle for womenaposs rights.The UN said: The year  is pivotal for achieving gender equality in the context of climate change, and environmental and disaster risk reduction, which are some of the greatest global challenges of the twenty-first century. Without gender equality today, a sustainable future, and an equal future, remains beyond our reach. It estimates that % of the . billion people living in conditions of poverty are women. Over the years, feminist movements have drawn attention to the need to redress the balance both within the workplace, socially, and in terms of how we think about the recognition of womenaposs contribution to the furthering of our society. Radical developments in engineering, science and general appliances have dramatically changed the face of the world we live in, but many would argue they are not as well recognised as they should be. Often, some of the best inventions go unnoticed, despite their use in our everyday lives. Who invented Kevlar   Kevlar was invented by Stephanie L. Kwolek, a Delware-based chemist. The material is used in bulletproof vests and other protective equipment, with its main features being that it is both light and strong.  It has saved countless lives over the years and is familiar to war reporters and soldiers. Kowelek patented the process of making Kevlar in . Who was Bessie Blount Grfin   The brilliant Bessie Blount Grfin was an American physical therapist known for working with soldiers during the first world war and inventing the feeding tube. Many soldiers became amputees due to the fighting and Blount noticed that much of the equipment was poor or inadequate. In her therapies, she taught amputees alternative ways of using their limbs, including people who lost their arms learning to use their mouths to write and their feet for general tasks.  Her invention of the feeding tube stands out the most, however, and meant that a tube inserted into the patientaposs mouth allowed them to eat independently and comfortably. Her aposportable receptacle support” was patented in  and the rights were bought by the French government one year later.After this, Blount went on to invent a disposable cardboard vomit basin, still standard in Belgian hospitals today according to Black Past.The History website argues she may well have been the first black woman to train at Scotland Yard’s Document Division, after moving into a career in forensics. Who was Ada Lovelace and what did she invent   The first computer algorithm is credited to pioneer mathematician Ada Lovelace. The daughter of poet Lord Byron, Ada built on the work by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea to formulate a code so elaborate and with such great depth that she is referred to as “the first computer programmer”.  Mathematician Anna Sfert from the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics said: If Ada had not written the first computer programme, someone  would have done it. The signicance of her work lies in the fact that she was the first to do so - a century before the invention of the computer. One-handed syringe  Letitia Mumford Greer patented the use of a one-handed syringe. Before this, a two-handed syringe was widely used by physicians.As the world continued to fight the coronavirus pandemic with a syringe or two, her invention was ahead of its time. The syringe did not initially become widely used when it was invented, as most drugs could not be injected, but the inventionaposs relevance grew and grew.Who invented the retractable dog leash  For people who have not had to follow their dog into the bushes to be greeted with all manner of unwanted substances, they can thank inventor Mary A. Delaney. In her own words, the intention was to stop our four-legged friends from running on the wrong side of lamp posts or pedestrians, thus causing much annoyance to the owner. Who invented the windscreen wiper   Crazy as it may seem, Mary Andersonaposs invention of windscreen wipers was not always standard on cars. She notice in a visit to New York City in  that passengers would get cold every time the driver opened the door to slip the window down, so set about inventing a new way of clearing the windscreen from inside the car.  Mary never profited from the invention, originally dismissed by car companies. What is stem cell isolation   Ann Tsukamoto was part of the team that found the first method of isolating blood-forming stem cells in . There is a huge amount of medical research into stem cells and they have been used in therapies for well over  years. Found in the bone marrow, stem cells are vital to cancer research. The University of Nebraska said: Research on stem cells continues to advance knowledge about how an organism develops from a single cell and how healthy cells replace damaged cells in adult organisms.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

Caroline Wortman, , discovered she was nearly ten weeks pregnant with her second child, Brooks, just six months after the birth of her first daughter, one-year-old Josie.This came after she was told that she may be infertile after being diagnosed with uterine didelphys, meaning she was born with two reproductive systems. Caroline said: Having children was always something I knew I wanted, but I just tried to stay positive and not dwell too much on it. Infertile was the story that I told myself for ten years. But after seven months of trying, Caroline became pregnant with Josie, and found out she was pregnant again just six months after her birth. Have you got an incredible story to tell  Email webnews@mirrorHer first ultrasound told her that her son was growing in the other uterus. Josie was in the right, Brooks was in the left said Caroline, from Woodstock, Georgia. For women with my specic diagnosis I just hope that this is one story that they can turn to and say aposlook, this girl was told no and she had two healthy babies in one yearapos, she said. Uterine Didelphys is caused because when a female foetus is growing, the uterus starts out as two small tubes called Mllerian ducts. These will eventually fuse together to form the reproductive system in a process called embryogenesis.  Women with uterine didelphys do not undergo full embryogenesis, and can be born with two full reproductive systems. Caroline was  when she had her first appointment with the gynaecologist who, after completing the exam, told her that she had two cervixes. She said: I honestly shrugged it off because I didnapost really realize what the implications could be. I did ask the doctor what having two cervixes meant and remember her telling me that I may be infertile andI did become pregnant, it would likely be complicated and high risk. I think this took years and meeting my husband to really sink in, but it was always in the back of my mind.  A couple of months later she went for an internal ultrasound where it was confirmed that she had two complete uteruses, and was diagnosed with uterine didelphys. She was also told that it may be dficult for her to get pregnant in the future. Caroline, who works for a law firm, said: I always knew I wanted to be a mum, I just wasnapost sure that I would be able to without adoption, surrogacy or some other intervention. As she grew up, her diagnosis did not affect her le, but things changed when she met her now-husband Nate Daniel Wortman, , when she was . The couple were married in September  and very quickly started trying for a family.  She said: I didnapost know how long it may take,at all. I was worried but you always hear worrying makes getting pregnant harder, so we just tried to be happy and relaxed as newlyweds about the whole thing.She found out she was pregnant in April .Her uterus that was not carrying her baby was simply pushed aside as it grew, and little Josie Magnolia Wortman was born on January  at a healthy six pounds.The family-of-three spent a happy six months as just that, before Caroline started feeling nauseous while out at lunch with her parents the following June.We were giggly with excitement but also still terried. The visual communications graduate said. The couple had not been trying for a second baby, but at her next appointment Caroline discovered she was already almost ten weeks along - and the baby was growing in her other uterus. She said: The baby was small enough each time to see the other uterus and confirm which side the baby was in - Josie was in the right, Brooks was in the left. Brooks Daniel Hayes Wortman was born on Boxing Day  weighing just lbs oz, and remained in the NICU for nine days.  She shared her unique pregnancy story on TikTok, which now has over , views in order to raise awareness of fertility struggles.She said: Being infertile and thinking you will be infertile are two drastically dferent things, but I would just encourage women to not give upthey want to become mothers, and to not take a doctoraposs words as the be all and end all. I donapost remember really coming across any relatable stories with my specic diagnosis during my pregnancy, so I hope this can be that to at least one woman.

It was obvious he had set himself a goal. More likely he had understood that he had to achieve something in his le. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blogBefore this, a fellow teacher told Vera that she regarded Putin as sneaky and disorganised but Gurevich said she immediately spotted that he would make something of himself. In the book, Putin said he enjoyed school as long as he managed to be the unspoken leader, meaning he didnapost try to command people and remained independent. But he realised that he needed to improve his social status - and began playing sports, alongside trying harder in his classes. Vera helped Putin improve, as she began to shower him with attention and discourage him from hanging around the streets with a wayward pair of brothers. But while other pupils enjoyed attending dances, Putin avoided attending and didnapost like socialising in favour of attending judo classes four times a week. He told the bookaposs authors: When I began to do sports...I used to work out every other day and then every day. Soon I had no time for anything . I had other priorities, I had to prove myself in sports, achieve something, I set goals. The pair grew very close, with Vera becoming a second mother to him, even taking him on holiday. She told the bookaposs authors in : I think [Putin] is a good person. But he never forgives people who betray him or are mean to him.In an interview with the BBC today Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it was clear President Vladimir Putin was a “spent force”. He said the Russian leader would not break the people of Ukraine and that he now potentially faced decades of occupation which would be impossible to sustain.“Whatever we think about President Putin, he is done. He is a spent force in the world. No-one will be taking his phone calls in the long term,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “He has exhausted his army, he is responsible for thousands of Russian soldiers being killed, responsible for innocent people being killed, civilians being killed in Ukraine. “He is reducing his economy to zero, because the international community has decided that is absolutely unacceptable, what he’s done. “So he is a spent force in the world and I don’t know whether he thinks that’s a clever thing to be, but that diminishes his own country in the world and he has to take responsibility for that.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationRussia Ukraine warVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"oban golfer bob shines in californian sun","story":"With  top  world-ranking players in the field, the honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member was going head-to-head with the one of the strongest fields assembled outside a major championship.Having shown signicant signs of ato form in his previous two tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, this was a chance for the left hander to build on his progress and climb back towards the top  in the world rankings.An opening level par  on Thursday left Bob in the middle of the pack after day one.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen

private in the Argylls.He was mobilised to France and was at Dunkirk and, after ing to the UK, was later mobilised to North Africa where he was awarded the Military Medal at the Battle of Longstop Hill. He was commissioned in the field in Africa.Later advancing through Italy, Germany and Austria, he ended his service in an Austrian town called Dolsech, after which his home in Campbeltown is named.During discussions on his war service with Lt Col Donald Ross OBE and Col Robert Steele, it became apparent that he had not been awarded the Territorial Decoration to which he was entitled.The army medals office was approached and it was agreed MajMcMillan should receive this honour and he was awarded the Territorial Medal in the Queen’s New Year’s Honours List.At a ceremony last week, his family joined him, including son James who travelled from Canada to witness the medal presentation at the former RAF airbase at Machrihanish.Major McMillan said: #I am delighted to see some of my oldest friends here and as well as receiving this medal, it has made my day.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOIslay’s Ardbeg Distillery has been bought by Glenmorangie plc for £ million.Allied Domecq plc, which owned Ardbeg Distillery, will receive £ million of the total sum in tranches within the next three years.The sale includes the Ardbeg brand, the distillery and surrounding land as well as the stock profile which will come on stream as Ardbeg -year-old and -year-old stocks mature.It will signicantly strengthen Glenmorangie’s current portfolio of malt whiskies which include Glenmorangie and Glen Moray and will provide excellent potential for new brand development, utilising the company’s proven experience in premium brand management.Commenting on the acquisition, Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of Glenmorangie plc, said: #The company has made signicant progress since the introduction of a new strategy in .#We are particularly confident that our existing portfolio will continue to deliver above average growth and we wish to exploit our marketing capability to achieve a similar success rate with this Islay malt.#An opportunity such as Ardbeg, in a segment of the market which remains under developed, provides us with a rare opportunity.#Glenmorangie is well positioned in the Scotch whisky market, with a strong presence in the malt sector which grew by . per cent in the year to October  in export markets and by  per cent from January to October .FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Lachlan McKinnon, the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist officer, this week reported bumper bookings for the coming season.Talking to a Courier man, Mr McKinnon said that there had been a tremendous boom in the self-catering type of holiday.In fact, the association’s list of cottages, chalets and so on has become exhausted with the result that the months of June, July, August up until the middle of September are fully booked.A total of , enquiries were dealt with in the association’s Campbeltown headquarters by the end of February, an increase of  on last year.Mr McKinnon said he hoped the upward trend in self-catering holidays would continue further and preparations would be made to meet with the demand.It is hoped that the Arran-Kintyre ferry service proposed for this summer will be successful.Mr McKinnon’s plan is to bombard the landing jetty at Claonaig with advertising literature in an attempt to induce motorists south to Campbeltown.He feels strongly that the local authority, hoteliers and businessmen should spend more on advertising nationally in an all-out effort to attract tourism to the burgh.‘Unfortunately the tourist association does not have the money to advertise a specic place.

they were working, was unsafe.However, an inspector of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, who made a thorough inspection of the colliery on Thursday, on the recommendation of the manager Mr James W Williamson, reported that the colliery was perfectly safe and that the method of working was highly satisfactory.Prior to his inspection, the men, at one of their meetings in Campbeltown, claimed that too much coal was being extracted from the section concerned and expressed their fear that it might lead to a major disaster.Mr William Marshall, president of the Argyll branch of the NUM and one of the men involved, denied that the two men who originally stopped work because of the alleged danger were men of little mining experience.He stated that one of these men had  years’ experience in mining in the Blantyre district, while the other man had  years’ experience in another Scottish mining area.He argued that on several occasions the men had to quit the road because of creaking and

of washing through its new laundry service, after moving its headquarters from a former retail shop on Longrow to a unit at Snipefield Industrial Estate.The new Launder-Aide venture offers a same-day laundry and ironing service, with pick-up and delivery included.‘We had been looking for new premises for some time and the unit has everything we need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand books and other items.The importance of Shopper-Aide has been highlighted during the Covid pandemic, with its outstanding work in the community earning it a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service, the UK#s highest award for volunteers.During the first lockdown, the charity’s shopping client-base more than doubled, but an influx of volunteers who were unable to work due to Covid restrictions supported the charity to cope with the increased demand.Volunteers also helped Shopper-Aide to continue providing entertainment to older people throughout lockdown, despite not being able to hold its regular groups, by organising virtual afternoon teas and quizzes and a poetry competition.A ‘Phone Buddies’ system was also set-up, offering one-to-one phone-calls to clients.The charity encouraged its clients to knit squares as part of its ‘lockdown blankets’ project.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

It would be easy to spend an entire afternoon in the lobby alone, getting lost in the town’s beauty.Its fair to say, the ‘Grand Old Lady’ is back to her former glory and better than ever...Marine Hotel, North Berwick Set on Cromwell Road, The Marine Hotel North Berwick occupies a prime position just streets away from the town’s charming beach and harbour. Its buttercream stone facade is easy to locate and its large free parking area means carrying luggage to the door is a breeze.For tourists and visitors, the hotel is in a prime position within walking distance of a iety of restaurants, some of which serve the freshest seafood from the harbour, alongside fish and chip takeaways and the well-loved and always popular Alandas Gelato.Upon entry to the hotel foyer, guests will be blown away by the sublime views out of large open windows of the iconic Bass Rock.The revamped Marine Hotel, North Berwick There’s ample free parking, a large restaurant, bar area, spa facilities, free Wi-Fi and more.The lobby at night The design throughout the hotel takes inspiration from Scotland’s world-renowned golf courses and notable figures, with nods to the hotel’s stunning seaside location and surrounding natural wonders.A deep colour palette dominates here: the lobby is a mixed wash of patterned wallpaper and dark emerald window fittings. Seating areas boast a selection of large leather couches and intimate tables of two – both of which offer stunning views of the waters that make North Berwick so popular.The hotel embraces the beauty of the wilderness on its front door, with interiors pulling from the agricultural and architectural history of the area. Local heritage is displayed through framed prints of wildle found on the Bass Rock. The refurbished style is reminiscent of F.

Main courses include options of venison, halibut and duck breast.The quality of the food is a definite selling point I’d recommend the haggis bonbons to start, while the Tweed valley beef with Chimichurri sauce makes for an admirable main course.The only distraction in the dining area was the rather bleak music played throughout dinner. Additionally, I would recommend a late dinner, with the atmosphere of the eatery heating up at around pm.Breakfast is a generous premium buffet served in the restaurant with an additional menu of warm and cooked items the French toast is not to be missed. From my understanding, the pastries on offer at the buffet are made in house and the best I’ve ever eaten.The overall dining experience at The Lawn was high class, most of all due to the eagerness and humour of our server. If you visit The Lawn, with or without a booked stay at The Marine, always ask for Richie!Cocktails created by talented bar staff are the perfect dinner treat Staff are faultless in their presentation, their unorm neat and matching they’re eager to help and accommodate.Marine Hotel North Berwick Without a doubt, the staff are among the most polite and caring I have ever met. A special mention goes to Surajit Dasgupta for his outstanding care and attention throughout the stay. His service alone would justy booking a night’s stay at The Marine.The atmosphere and charm of this hotel is so special that, despite living just a few miles down the road, it felt like a well-needed break from day-to-day le.

Better Together won the campaign, but Labour lost the war – Johan Lamont quit, citing “a branch office of London”, and ushering in the Jim Murphy era and electoral disaster.But Mr Smith is correct, the next referendum will be dferent. The last  years have shown us that a “third option” is no longer believable. If Labour runs with this ticket, it will need to answer what powers any constitutional bill would contain how it would get them through Westminster how those powers would be entrenched against usurpation , by a Supreme Court and a Westminster which considers each new parliament as “sovereign”, and not bound by the previous one.Scotland being independent would obviously not solve any of “the big questions the world is challenged by”, but a new democratic country emerging is surely a global plus, and a poke in the eye for the despots and autocrats.GR Weir, Ochiltree.PUTIN WOULD HAVE WANTED YES WINTHERE has been some debate in your columns as to whether Vladimir Putin would have been supportive or otherwise towards the Yes campaign for Scottish independence .I would have thought that the facts that President Putin was engaged in  in an arms race with the West and that, at about the same time, the then Scottish Government issued a draft constitution for an independent Scotland which, at clause , compelled the anticipated independent Scottish government to effect “the safe and expeditious removal from the territory of Scotland of nuclear weapons based there” were salient to that debate.It would appear to have been logical, rational and even inevitable that Mr Putin would have wished for the success of the Yes campaign to secure that constitution for Scotland. Whether or not he would ever have gone to the s of interfering with another’s nation’s internal affairs is another matter but recent events indicate a willingness to do so.Michael Sheridan, by Strachur, Argyll.KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROADI SEE that Nicola Sturgeon has sent Ian Blackford out to deliver bad news to their followers: that they should focus on the Ukraine crisis and not expect a referendum in the short term . In truth there was never going to be a referendum in , Ms Sturgeon’s proclaimed favoured date. Some former SNP high-profile bloggers have abandoned that illusion to the extent of ceasing their campaigning activity.We already knew that Ms Sturgeon was merely kicking the can down the road by announcing a vote in . She cannot hold a legitimate referendum without the transfer of authority for one, with a Section  order, from the UK Prime Minister, who has steadfastly refused to provide one. She could hold an unauthorised referendum, but that would raise questions, probably legal questions, about the co-operation of local authorities with premises and staffing for such an event. An unauthorised referendum would not be recognised by other countries or international organisations.Ms Sturgeon had already indicated that she was not planning to hold a referendum by having no mention of it in the recent -year SNP economic plan that isnt really a plan which was announced by Kate Forbes. Why would an SNP economic plan make provision for the next  years without discussing the circumstances of a separate Scotlandthe objective was to hold a referendum in that period Ms Sturgeon’s followers are left wondering what a devolved \"focus on Ukraine\" is and why that stymies their dream.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.SECOND N-BOMB WOULD BE POINTLESSON BBC Radio s Any Questions at the weekend, from Penicuik, the second question was from one Thomas, who sounded very young, who asked the  a very pertinent and searching question. If Mr Putin deploys a \"tactical\" nuclear weapon, how should Nato respond  Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said he was going to dodge that question. As a Cabinet minister, he clearly doesnt wish Mr Putin to know the Wests game plan. Then he added, I thought with infinite condescension: \"But dont worry. You can sleep peacefully at night, because the nuclear deterrent is protecting you.\"But on Radio s A Point of View on Sunday morning, with respect to the deterrent, the writer Will Self did not share Mr Jacks equanimity. He made reference to Nevil Shutes apocalyptic vision of the end of the world, On the Beach, in which radioactive fallout destroys all le on Earth. He told us to be afraid, very afraid. I wonder what would have happened , when the Russians shelled Europes biggest nuclear power station at Zaporizhazhia, they had breached the reactors  Presumably the invading forces would have had no choice but to evacuate the theatre of war. It would have been a catastrophe for both Europe and Russia, but it is sobering to reflect that such an event might not be the worst-case scenario. At least it could have been spun as an \"accident\". Deployment of a \"tactical\" nuclear weapon, on the other hand, would be deliberate, and would predicate, according to the deterrent doctrine, a reprisal. And then we find ourselves on Nevil Shutes beach.I wish Mr Jack had said to his young inquisitor, \"Well,Mr Putin explodes a nuclear bomb, he will have demonstrated that the nuclear deterrent doesnt work. So what would be the point in exploding another one \"Dr Hamish Maclaren, Stirling.DETERRENCE DOES WORKIAN Blackford claims that nuclear weapons should be removed because they are not a deterrentbut this familiar SNP talking point has just been proven wrong, by Vladimir Putin himself.After all, Nato is refusing to escalate and establish the Ukranian no-fly zone or provide more active support that suffering Ukrainians and President Zelensky have been so desperately requesting specically because we have been effectively intimidated by Mr Putins threats of nuclear retaliation.Nuclear deterrence demonstrably works – all too well – and while it binds our hands in the tragedy of Ukraine it also protects the other smaller nations formerly dominated by Russia. Recent events do not discredit nuclear defence, but show why we need it to limit Russian aggression.Robert Frazer, Dundee.* IN half a sentence, when Vladimir Putin alluded to the terrible consequences that could emanate from outside interference in his plans for Ukraine, any argument that nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent to war was immediately and unequivocally destroyed.The argument is based on the logic that nobody wants mutually assured destruction, assuming that everyone, everywhere, in all circumstances, will act logically. As we are now witnessing, all it takes is one powerful inidual to buck the norm and we are on the brink of global disaster. Worse, logic then suggests thatan egocentric inidual like President Putin feels cornered by subsequent resistance, he may actually have nothing to lose by unleashing all his power on his perceived enemies.Andhe does, do we retaliate and unleash our own, on millions of innocent people unfortunate enough to have someone like Mr Putin in charge of their country  That too would be criminal.The only way to avoid a potential nuclear war is for no country to have nuclear weapons, full stop. Hopefully, it is not yet too late to learn the lesson.Liam Kane, East Kilbride.NATO MUST DO THE RIGHT THINGON Sunday , American Express joined the growing corporate boycott of Russia and issued the exemplary statement that one of its core values is “to do what is right\". Nato should pay heed. Rather than reciting ad nauseam the mealy-mouthed mantra that Ukraine is not a Nato member, the western allies should adopt the same laudable approach as AmEx and impose humanitarian no-fly zones in support of evacuation corridors. Otherwise, in a long drawn-out conflict, Nato is condemning thousands of innocent civilians and fleeing refugees to their death in the coming months.Ian Forbes, Glasgow.Read more: Dont blame Nato or Brexit for Putins evil"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-exploding-myths-around-creation-scottish-parliament-holyrood","story":"Unfortunately he has been misinformed about the background to its construction, making much of the rest of the article seriously misleading. It is important to remember that at the time of its construction the project became a political football, with many half-truths and untruths being published , to create a mythic fantasy.I will not comment point by point on Mr Grindrod’s misapprehensions, but feel that I should correct some of these. For a start, he does not seem to appreciate that Donald Dewar’s aspiration was to create a building of such presence and status that it would embody the vision of an inclusive parliament, worthy of all of Scotland. For instance, the chamber was designed to be non-confrontational, and the committee rooms to emphasise the roles of committees.Mr Grindrod, like many before him, makes much of escalating costs. Dewar,I remember correctly, said that a parliament building could be built for about £ million. This was never a budget figure, and merely represented possible costs for very basic accommodation. The architectural competition was to choose a designer, not a design. The short-listed candidates were not those quoted by Mr Grindrod, and when the interviews were heldthe Miralles Tagliabuie submission was unanimously agreed by the jury to be the best. Alone among the competitors this practice understood not only Dewar’s vision, but also the opportunity offered by the setting.Mr Grindrod is completely wrong in suggesting that Miralles had \"gone rogue and suggested a new location at Holyrood\". Originally three sites had been considered , and feasibility studies prepared. At a late date the Holyrood site became available. After a rapid feasibility study had been completed, Dewar chose this site for a iety of reasons, notably security. This was the site for which all the short-listed firms prepared their entries. The site had not, however, as suggested by Mr Grindrod, \"once been the garden of Queensberry House\", though that house and its garden were part of it most of it had been a brewery and brewery offices.Mr Grindrod also refers to the competition as \"this most conservative of competitions\" and asks why it was won by \"what seemed a fundamentally bonkers piece of magical thinking\". The competition was in no sense \"conservative\": it was about creating a new and inspiring home for a radically new parliament. The EMBT entry clearly addressed the client’s needs as set out in the brief, and in addition interacted successfully with the outstanding built and natural environments of the site.Finally, the new Wembley Stadium, completed soon after the Holyrood building, cost considerably more..John R Hume, Glasgow.KNIGHT-TIME ESCAPADESGAVIN Williamson’s knighthood Letters, March , along with the preposterous peerage of KGB agents son Evgeny Lebedev, and the many tax exile Tory benefactors, have all, once again, highlighted the absurdity of the honours system.While changing this discredited system requires time, money and legislation, it can quite easily be demolished overnight, and without cost, by each of us simply awarding ourselves a title.There is nothing illegal in calling yourself \"Sir\" providing you are not doing so with the intention to defraud, and the English rugby player \"Sir\" Brian Moore has already shown us the way, on Twitter.I awarded myself a knighthood last year, initially to establish whether the many bars, cafes and restaurants, who were obliged to collect our personal data for Covid tracing purposes, were complying with data protection laws. As it turned out, many were not, and my title is now widely disseminated. I now frequently receive advertising material using my title.When the whole country has a title of some sort, the system will be quickly and thoroughly discredited.In the meantime, as my own knighthood has been so devalued by the appointment of Gavin Williamson to our number, I believe it’s time to award myself an upgrade. \"His Serene Highness\" has a nice ring to it, don’t you think  Sir William Keil, Edinburgh.SNEAKY WAY TO RAISE PRICESI RECENTLY ordered, online from Sainsburys, a couple of g tins of my favourite Nestlé coffee which is normally priced at £ per tin. Often I will buy it when it is on reduced price of £ so that I can have a small stock of tins to hand when needed.Looking in my food cupboard the other day I happened to notice that the newer tins were a slightly dferent size from the older ones and, on checking the label, it now reads g – ergo a  per cent reduction at the same original price. Now it may be that the new size was noted on the internet shopping page ,but you only click to order the item and dont necessarily check the details. I will check in future.Alastair J Douglas, Erskine.* CAN someone explain why, apart from blatant profiteering greed, two Shell garages in North Glasgow have their diesel at p and p per litre when a trip to Devon and back over the weekend never saw it much above p and I was able to fill up on Sunday morning at .p litre  There is even a Shell garage in Kirkintilloch with lowish prices.Needless to say, they have lost this customer.Douglas Jardine, Bishopbriggs.CENSUS  WHAT A JOB IT ISNOTING Russell Smiths wry comments on the Census questionsI would add that both my we and I had no hesitation in answering \"Yes\" when askedwe would be able to accept an offer to start a new job in two weeks time.

As a feminist, and as a person assigned female at birth, I identy with my material history of being brought up, perceived as, and oppressed as a woman – something I don’t have to look far back to find examples of.I am a survivor, multiply. I have lived with the trauma of reporting an assault, of navigating a crumbling criminal justice system, but my focus is now on the teaching and practice of consent. For this International Women’s Day, you will find me planning creative workshops with other survivors in my neighbourhood of Govanhill, collaborating on research about dferent intersecting issues, and drafting teaching materials for S-S levels in Scottish schools.Sexual consent is not routinely taught in UK schools. A better understanding of consent encourages active communication, respectful boundary-making, and a thoughtful approach to interactions with peers. In teaching children to care for themselves, to respect their own bodily integrity and personal autonomy, we cannot forget to teach them that – for a successful society - this care must be interdependent, it must extend to how we approach and relate to others.As a survivor, my experiences will have changed me, forever. But my history can be used to inform a vision of better futures with better systems of education. Last month, Australia became the first country to pass a law enforcing universal consent education within schools. Scotland is a world leader in so many issues - may this be one of them."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13553788.jpg?type=article-full","title":"iwd-swim-joy-hugs-tears-700-swimmers","story":" Jeff Mitchell Getty, IWD Swimrise , Portobello, Edinburgh The women lost to Covid, the vigils for Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa, the domestic abuse that rose during lockdown, a time when victims had no escaoe, the loss of Alice Byrne, local woman, who was last seen going into the sea on this beach, and more recently, the way the conflict in Ukraine is impacting on both those who stay and those who flee as refugees... all of these were thought about in a moments silence held on the beach.Jeff Mitchell Getty, IWD Swimrise , Portobello, Edinburgh The annual International Womens Day swim is a recent tradition, started in  at Wardie Bay, Edinburgh, that has swelled the size of its crowd, partly due to the rise in popularity of wild swimming over the pandemic.

We are Australian and that certainly helped us bond with Kylie. We have a fantastic and close working relationship and we share a commitment to maintain the high quality of the wines we produce.”Kylie’s Rosé is the most successful Rosé in the UK and now, following on from that success, Benchmark launched Gary Barlow’s range at the end of last year, as well as launching Gordon Ramsay Wines.“We also represent Graham Norton and Sarah Jessica Parker wines,” adds Madeleine. “We have the ideal  and an experienced team behind these brands.”Madeleine’s background is in fashion and retail and she quickly realised there was a gap in the market for fun but luxury gts surrounding the celebrity brands.She realised that there could be a direct connection with the people that were drinking the wines that they made. “So I started Wine Delivered at the end of the  and haven’t looked back,” said Madeleine.The entrepreneur also has four children, two girls and two boys, and says she enjoys the juggle between running a full-time business and looking after them.“Now they are a bit older, they don’t need as much attention which has allowed me to focus more on the business. I’m lucky as I can work from home, or the office where I have a small team. “I’m also lucky that I can be flexible with my hours so I can be there for my family when they need me. They have also supported me – my children can often be found in the warehouse helping me pack the hampers at busy times of the year like Christmas or Easter!”Wine Delivered has so many ideal Mother’s Day gts and for Madeleine it is always a special day.“I try to make sure all my children are at home and that we have a special lunch together to celebrate. We will start the day with a glass of Kylie Minogue’s or Graham Norton Prosecco and a enjoy a glass of Gary Barlow Organic Wine with some smoked salmon and Gordon Ramsay’s Rosso Intenso with Roast Lamb or Beef.”Onethe most popular Mother’s Day gts this year will be Kylie’s Prosecco Rosé and heart shaped biscuit gt pack.“It is so pretty and says thank you so clearly,” says Madeleine. “If your mother is a Gary Barlow fan then we have his Jute Bag with bottles of his organic wines and chocolate truffles.

Functional and effective though it was at its best, Cockerill’s game plan left little room for the sort of artistry in which Bennett excels. Blair, on the other hand, positively encourages the expression of such attributes, and the -year-old is one of those who have thrived in the new environment.We will find out when the Scotland team to play Italy is announced tomorrow whether Bennett will make his first start in six years, but at least he is now back in contention and doing his talents justice. “It’s been a good season for me,” he said earlier this week after a national squad training session. “We’ve played some exciting rugby at Edinburgh. “I think that’s given me the opportunities to be me. I think that’s what you saw in the second half against France - I got the ball and I was just doing what I do. I absolutely loved it, and I’m hopeful to be involved again.”Askedthose ‘opportunities to be me’ were conspicuous by their absence under Cockerill, Bennett continued: “I think they were more limited, and I had to adapt the way I played to suit - and I did that. It meant I didn’t get too many opportunities to do what I do best, but I gave it my all.“The fire was always there, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t doubt myself. And there were plenty times I probably did think I was done internationally, but I stuck to my guns and here we are.”Bennett is fast enough to play on the wingneeds must, but, more realistically,he is to get into Gregor Townsend’s starting  for the Six Nations game in Rome, he will almost certainly have to replace Chris Harris, a player who, after an unassuming start to his own international career has seen his reputation grow steadily to the extent that he is now regarded as one of the first names to be inked into the head coach’s team sheet. The primary reason for that rise to prominence by the Gloucester back is his defensive excellence - not only as an inidual in the tackle, but as a pivotal organiser of the team.By contrast, Bennett’s speed off the mark and his eye for the opening are the qualities that have set him apart. A decision to select him rather than Harris could therefore say a lot about Scotland’s game plan - although Bennett himself thinks it is not a simple question of attacker versus defender.“I know I can defend well, but it’s not a super-strength of mine like it is for Chris,” he continued. “It’s a part of my game which is not the most natural. I’m much more of an attacking-minded player. I know that I can do things on the other side of the ball that perhaps he wouldn’t do, so for me it’s not a case of thinking that I have to be the best defender on the pitch. What I bring is where.“But the one thing I will say is that I’ve never really worked with Chris up until now and he does defend bloody well. I’ve seen it at training and he is good. So for me it’s been brilliant to train alongside him and learn from him. It’s a good challenge.“And the one thing I’ve picked up from him is that he’s never ever stressed. It might not look like that on the pitch but he’s always calm and under control, even when there are bombs going off round about him. I think that’s been something I’ve looked at and thought it would be good for me, because I can be quite jumpy when it gets that way and I like to try and solve things quickly, whereas he’s really, really calm and takes it all in his stride.”Bennett has played twice against Italy so far, with the first occasion, in , also being the last time Scotland lost the fixture. “What I remember from that day was my first international try,” he added. “An intercept.“And I know we started strongly and I think Italy scored two tries in the last - minutes off the driving maul. They really put us to the sword there physically. “Italy have a really talented squad, and I think it is a matter of time before they become a real force. We need to be ready for this one.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Middle earners could spend a fth of their salary on rent in some areas, or nearly triple that in others.Median-priced flats in Edinburgh – the biggest and most unaffordable rental market – could consume  per cent of a local middle earner’s wage, or  per cent of a low earner’s wage.Campaigners and politicians said our investigation illustrates how unaffordable renting has become in Scotland’s “increasingly broken housing market”. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation stressed that a third of Scotland’s private renters – around , people – already live in poverty.Property experts confirmed that dwindling rental stock is increasing competition and pushing up rent prices as landlords sell up amidst record house prices.Nationwide data shared with The Ferret also shows that homes sold to first time buyers in Scotland last June cost, on average, . times the average national earnings. Since then, house prices have surged further.Developers, letting agents and landlords are making “insane” profits, argued the tenant’s union, Living Rent. The most recent accounts from housebuilders active in Scotland showed collective pre-tax profits of more than £bn.The Scottish Government said it had made a “clear commitment” to introducing rent caps in the current parliamentary term as part of its new deal for tenants consultation.But Scottish Labour warned of rents “spiralling out of control” with “record breaking increases”. Both Labour and Living Rent urged the government to introduce rent controls immediately.To get a picture of the rental market, The Ferret analysed , Scottish rental property listings advertised on  January via property search engine, Nestoria.In this snapshot, the average monthly rent was £, with two-bed properties the most common option. Renters could typically pay £ for a one-bed, £ for a two-bed, £ for a three-bed and £, for a four-bed.Comparing local earning statistics from the Office of National Statisticsagainst local rents showed that letting is most unaffordable in Edinburgh. For example, the capital’s median – or middle – earners could spend  per cent of their salary on the median rent, or  per cent on the cheapest.In Glasgow, median earners could lose  per cent of their earnings on median rents, or  per cent on the cheapest. Middle earners in East Lothian, Stirling and East Dunbartonshire could spend  per cent of their wages on the median rent, or - per cent on the cheapest.Comparatively, median earners in East Ayrshire or Renfrewshire could spend just  per cent of their salary on the median rent, or - per cent on the cheapest.Rents most unaffordable to the lowest paidFor Scotland’s lowest earners, even the cheapest local lets in some areas could consume the bulk of their salaries.Edinburgh’s lowest paid could lose  per cent of their earnings on renting one of the capitals cheapest properties. Renting a median-priced flat could consume  per cent.In East Lothian, low earners could spend  per cent of their wages on the cheapest rents, or  per cent on the median. The cheapest to median rent prices for low earners in Midlothian could take up - per cent of their wages, and - per cent in East Dunbartonshire.Rent was most affordable in Inverclyde, East Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire, where the cheapest to median lets ranged from  per cent to  per cent of the lowest wages.But these locations had just one per cent or less of all properties advertised on Nestoria. Many areas lacked rental homes, leaving renters with little choice of accommodation. We found no lets advertised in Shetland or the Western Isles.Some  per cent of listed lets were in Edinburgh,  per cent in Aberdeen and  per cent in Glasgow. Aberdeen’s cheapest flats could account for  per cent of the lowest income, while Glasgow’s could require  per cent.Other larger rental markets included Dundee, Perth and Kinross and Renfrewshire, where the cheapest rents could cost  per cent of the lowest local incomes, and South Lanarkshire, where they could take up  per cent.Call for rent controls as one third of renters in poverty“These stark figures lay bare the cost of the renting crisis that so many households are struggling with,” said Labour’s housing spokesperson, Mark Grfin MSP.“There is no time to waste while tenants are struggling to make ends meet in the middle of a cost of living crisis. The SNP must move forward with plans for rent controls as a matter of urgency, and alongside a real plan to fix Scotland’s increasingly broken housing market.”The Joseph Rowntree Foundationsaid: \"What this research illustrates is just how far the rents being asked for outstrip what those on modest incomes are likely to be able to afford.”While social security support is available, “we can demonstrate it simply isn’t enough to prevent hardship,\" said a JRF spokesperson. Young people, single parents and ethnic minority communities were among those most impacted, JRF said.Scotland needs a stronger affordable housing scheme, the spokesperson argued. A third of Scotland’s private renters – around , people – live in poverty, according to research from the JRF and others.Of these renters,  per cent were pushed into poverty by housing costs. “That’s , people who could be helped with effective action to lt incomes and reduce costs,” JRF added.Rufus Boverie of Living Rent said: “Up and down the country, we hear of tenants struggling and being driven into poverty by sky-high rents. These numbers just confirm our experiences and the need for the government to introduce real rent controls now.“Property developers, landlords and letting agents are making insane profits and reaping the benefits of the lack of regulation. Tenants cant afford another five years of rent hikes.”Tenants’ rights minister, Patrick Harvie MSP, said the government had provided £m in housing support this year, £m to avoid evictions due to the pandemic and was committed to introducing rent controls.“I am determined to put in place measures which are robust and which stand the test of time,” he said. The government would deliver , affordable homes over the next decade and had given councils the power to control short-term lets, which had led to loss of rented properties, added Harvie.Scotland’s biggest letting agentsThe Ferret also can also reveal that renters are being asked to outbid one another just to secure a home, further pushing up rents. Soon, “tenants may not be able to find anywhere to live regardless of cash” and the supply drought must be “tackled urgently”, warned the Scottish Association of Landlords.Research shows the continued rise of rents, although there is no consensus on the extent. ONS stats show that Scottish rents rose by . per cent in the year from January  to .The HomeLet Rental Index estimated that the average Scottish rent rose by . per cent over the same period, while CityLets last year reported average annual rises of . per cent.Scotland’s major letting agents include Yorkshire’s Lomond Group, which claimed to be Scotland’s largest agent, with , properties, after acquiring the Edinburgh-based ​​DJ Alexander in December. This was reportedly the group’s th acquisition in .Lomond Group – the result of its £m merger with Linley  Simpson last year – also owns agencies including Allen  Harris, Braemore, FineHolm, Stonehouse, Burnett and Reid, and Broughton.Both Slater Hogg and Howison, with  branches, and Aberdeen’s Aberdein Considine with  in Scotland and Northern England, also claim to be Scotlands largest agent. The former is ultimately owned by Yorkshire’s Skipton Building Society.Skipton announced profits of £m for the first half of , up £m on the same period a year earlier.Global real estate giant Re Max has  Scottish offices. Glasgow-based Clyde Property, which ​​has , claims to manage over , lets.Record house pricesHouse prices repeatedly reached new record highs over the last year. Halax said prices in Scotland rose . per cent over the year to the end of January. The continued rise would make barriers to ownership \"more acute”, it said.The average asking price in Scotland again rose by . per cent between January and February alone, according to Rightmove, which it attributed to the rise to housing shortages and buyers seeking to move house as Covid- restrictions ease.In January Nationwide released a study to gauge housing affordability in the UK. Its data, shared with The Ferret, shows that homes sold to first time buyers in Scotland in June cost, depending on the area, between . and . times the average local earnings.Banks will typically lend a customer intending to buy a property no more than . times their income. The customer would also need to cover a deposit of at least five per cent of the property’s value, and other fees.Housebuilder profitsDevelopers are also set to profit further as house prices soar. Most of the biggest housebuilders active in Scotland announced signicant annual profits in recent months, following a Covid- downturn.The upmarket Cala Homes, owned by a financial services firm, predicted record revenues of £.bn for , with its £m pre-tax profit up  per cent on its , pre-pandemic revenues.Some housebuilders bought out their rivals or were acquired by private equity firms. Edinburgh-based Miller Homes was bought by US equity giant Apollo Global Management in December.Elgin-based Springfield Properties’ £.m pre-tax profits for the year to the end of May were up  per cent on the previous year. It bought the Inverness-based Tulloch Homes for £.m in December.Conversely, Aberdeen’s Stewart Milne and Elgin’s Robertson Homes reportedly saw losses of £.m and £.m in  respectively.

Consumers were uncertain about the outlook and an affordable iPhone was ideally placed to take advantage of that.“In  things have improved but the iPhone SE franchise still fills an important role as an affordable iPhone for consumers still cautious about splashing out on a top-of-the-line iPhone or who just don’t feel the need to spend more than is necessary.”Elsewhere at its latest event, Apple announced a new desktop computer, the Mac Studio and a companion screen – the -inch Studio Display – as a new flagship device for power users. vw,vw,px, px\"Apple’s new Mac Studio desktop computer and Studio Display monitor The computer will be the first to house the company’s latest own made computer chip – the M Ultra – which the firm says is the most powerful ever built for a personal computer.With the new M Ultra in place, Apple says the Mac Studio is nearly four times faster than its fastest iMac desktop computer.Starting at £, it comes with a number of dferent ports to enable connection with a broad range of other devices, including the new Studio Display monitor, which has a -inch screen and can support K resolution.The new monitor will cost £, Apple confirmed.The virtual event also saw Apple update the iPad Air tablet, placing its M chip into the device for a % performance increase on the previous generation, adding G connectivity, as well as an improved camera that includes Apple’s Centre Stage feature for video calls, which uses AI to automatically pan and keep those talking on the call in view.The iPhone  and  Pro devices are to be made available in a new green finish too, with all the new products announced going on sale on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"apple-looking-dominate-budget-smartphone-market-new-iphone-se  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Clarence House declined to comment as to whether Charles had helped his brother with the payment.Ms Giuffre was suing Andrew for sexual abuse, saying the duke had sex with her when she was  and had been trafficked by his friend, the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew, who has stepped down from royal duties and public le, claimed he has never met Ms Giuffre, but went on to avert a looming trial by agreeing a settlement last month.The Queen had already taken steps to distance the royal family from Andrew and protect the monarchy brand.She stripped him of his honorary military roles in January, with the duke also giving up using his HRH – a style he was born with. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen and the Duke of York The legal document from Ms Giuffre and the duke’s legal team read: “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure , and the parties’ settlement agreement dated February  , Plaintf Virginia L. Giuffre and Defendant Prince Andrew, Duke of York hereby stipulate to the dismissal of this action, with prejudice.“Each party to bear her his own costs and fees.”Andrew is reportedly in the process of selling his Swiss ski chalet, with the property expected to generate many millions in funds.The duke was forced to step down from public duties in  amid the scandal surrounding his association with Epstein.Andrew’s disastrous Newsnight interview sealed his fate when he was accused of lacking empathy for Epstein’s victims and of failing to show regret over his friendship with the disgraced financier.Ms Giuffre started legal action against the duke in August, saying it was “past the time for him to be held to account” for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.She alleges she was sexually abused while aged under  by Andrew at Ghislaine Maxwell’s home in London, at Epstein’s New York mansion and on Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands.Commments are closed on this article"},{"url":null,"title":"harry-kane-confident-tottenham-can-compound-manchester-uniteds-misery  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Obviously they have come off a disappointing result at the weekend.“There is always going to be a reaction and a bounce-back from their players and we need to make sure we are ready for that.“We obviously feel that there is an opportunity for us there because we have had a great result and we could try to use that momentum, especially away from home, against their crowd.“But it will be a tough game. They have got some great players. They beat us earlier on in the season quite comfortably. We have got to have all that in our heads, we have got to make sure we go with the right mindset – it’s a game we are looking forward to.“Old Trafford away is one of the best games you play in the league and you have got to be excited. You have got to go there and try to be free and put in another good performance.”Tottenham’s biggest Achilles heel lately has been their inability to string a run of results together – they followed up an impressive win at Manchester City with defeats at Burnley and in the FA Cup at Middlesbrough.They were back to their best against an albeit woeful Everton and Kane says the result and the performance was up there with the best in recent years.“There have been high performances all round – not just me but the whole team played really, really well,” he said. “It’s hard to say it is the best football we have played – we have had some great managers over the years and played some great football.“But beating Everton - and beating City away from home are right up there – fantastic results. And results that should give us confidence.“But like I said, and the manager said, we still need to keep improving and we still need to keep working hard. It is great having nights like this but we’ve got to prove ourselves over the last  games.”"},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dems-accuse-ministers-moving-slowly-russian-oil-import-ban   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

We need to do everything possible to isolate the Putin regime.”But he added the decision now “reinforces the case for further action to tackle the cost of living crisis” in the UK as well as “underlines the need for a decisive move towards clean energy”.Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy tweeted: “It’s right that the UK will phase out imports of Russian oil.“We need to do everything possible to cut the Putin, his cronies and the rogue Russian regime out of our economic system.”Boris Johnson suggested diesel prices could be set to rise further in Britain after the announcement, with prices at the pumps already having soared following Moscow’s attack on Kyiv.But the Prime Minister said the UK was “less exposed” than some European nations when it came to restricting Russian oil – the European Union imports more than a quarter of its oil from Russia.Speaking to broadcasters in London, Mr Johnson accepted the decision to target Moscow’s oil would not hit the Kremlin’s regime immediately, with Ukraine continuing to face assault, but said it would add to the “extreme” sanctions already levied.The UK imported goods from Russia worth a total of £. billion in , according to the Office for National Statistics .This was the equivalent of % of the total value of all imported goods from around the world.No UK petrol demand comes from Russia, nor heating or fuel oil but % of the total demand for diesel comes from Russia, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Tom Keatinge, director of the RUSI Centre for financial crime and security studies, told the Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday that unless the EU imposed similar sanctions on Russia, UK and US sanctions could merely push up prices.He said: “Someone pointed out to me yesterday that the rate at which commodity prices are rising at the moment, actually, Russia could sell a lot less but still earn just as much money.”Justine Walker, global head of sanctions, compliance and risk at the Association of Certied Anti-Money Laundering Specialists, said: “If we’re to target oil, then I think there needs to be a much broader consensus.“If you just have the US targeting oil or the UK targeting oil, then you are, as Tom says, you’re just going to drive up prices and actually will not be effective.”Askedthis meant there was no point in imposing the sanctions without a broader international consensus from other players like the EU, Mr Keatinge said: “I think we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact, price is obviously aof supply and demand.“So what are we doing to work with suppliers to replace the capacity that gets lost from from from Russia – but clearly the EU needs to buy into that strategy.”Meanwhile, Dr Chi Kong Chyong from the Energy Policy Research Group at Cambridge Judge Business School, warned that stopping the flow of Russian oil and gas into Europe may not be the “hammer blow” that Western countries are looking for.In an article published to the University of Cambridge website on Tuesday, he said: “Europe is part of a global, increasingly commoditised market, in which trade embargoes by one region will not be effectiveothers don’t follow.”"},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dems-accuse-ministers-moving-slowly-russian-oil-import-ban  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

What is the best way to save energy in our homes A. If your home isn’t yet insulated, then the best way to save money is to get your loft and your cavity walls insulated. You will soon recover the money spent and there may even be a grant available to help.After that, turning your thermostat down even by  degree Celsius can help save money — andyou need to, put on another layer of clothes to keep warm.Q. Does only filling a kettle with as much water to boil as you need really help A. Every small action helps and that includes only boiling the water you need in a kettle. Heating more water than you need means you are spending money unnecessarily.And it is also financially beneficial to heat water in a kettle and then add it to a pot, for exampleyou are boiling your potatoes, as a kettle is more efficient at heating water than many stoves.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate Change‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it went PremiumKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemBuzz words: net zero, a key way to tackle escalating climate changeFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Most ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for island‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockLatest EnvironmentThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan calls on Stormont to see benefits of city congestion scheme‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentLatestCivil case against Andrew comes to a close after settlement is paidRobert Lewandowski makes history as Bayern Munich demolish RB SalzburgCoca-Cola, Starbucks and McDonald’s suspend operations in RussiaLiverpool reach last eight of Champions League despite rare Anfield lossHome advantage means England’s Joe Marler does not feel like an underdog,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey pictured.March   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPoliticians are increasing recognising that immediate and decisive action on the climate crisis will not only influence votes — it will win votes.Indeed, for many Northern Irish voters, climate action will be one of the defining issues in the upcoming MLA elections in May.With these elections fast approaching, many candidates have already started leafleting and door-knocking. However, when a candidate knocks at your door, what questions should you ask them  More importantly, how do you know whether they are genuinely serious about what they propose To gain a deeper sense of the candidate’s knowledge and understanding of climate breakdown, begin the conversation in the context of the broader political landscape.There are currently two climate bills passing through the Northern Irish Assembly. These are subject to ongoing debates, reviews and amendments. Both bills have a target of net zero emissions. Yet while the Private Members’ Billaims for Northern Ireland to be net zero by , the Executive Billaims for .Read MoreClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsYou could therefore start by asking the following question: which bill do they support Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given how both bills aim for Northern Ireland to be net zero, despite ying target dates, a good follow-up question would be to ask how their party hopes to achieve this. How will they get us there  What is their political strategy  What concrete steps will they take to help Northern Ireland reach net zero Northern Ireland is not only the last nation in western Europe to implement climate legislation, but we also rank th worst in the world for bioersity loss. Nature recovery is therefore integral to an ambitious climate strategy.It is therefore crucial to ask the candidate about how they plan to halt and reverse nature and bioersity loss. How will they promote regenerative agricultural practices  How will they create more spaces for nature  How will they prevent the decline — and potential extinction — of our valuable species and wildle There are also three sectors in Northern Ireland which could be uniquely affected by the climate crisis: agriculture, energy and transport. These three sectors are vastly dferent. However, what unies questions regarding the future of these sectors is the principle of ‘just transition’.‘Just transition’ is the idea that we should not moveto a low-carbon, environmentally-friendly economyit means sacricing justice or ‘fairness’. A just transition recognises that, whether it be people on low incomes or workers in the fossil fuel industry, no one should be left behind in the creation of a ‘greener’ society.To take energy as an example, fossil fuels like oil and gas remain the primary source of heat and power in Northern Ireland. We already know that fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they will not help us to reach climate targets. Beyond asking candidate about renewable energy systems, we must therefore go one step further.We need to ask candidates about how they will compensate for workers in polluting industries, who may find themselves without a job in a more sustainable world. What incentive schemes will they promote  How will they re-train or upskill iniduals  How will government invest in this The same is true for agricultural and transport sectors. Will there be grants or public goods for farmers who dedicate areas of land to rewilding or regenerative practices  Will there be further investment in public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural communities  How will government incentivise citizens to support ‘greener’ lestyle choices that are typically more expensive, like buying an electric car or fitting solar  at home Lastly, ask the candidate seeking your vote about what is important to you.Whether it be plastic pollution or food waste, this is an invaluable opportunity for you to ask the candidate about a specic topic that you care deeply about. This could be an ongoing problem in your local area, or a global issue which causes you concern.Raising more personal questions with candidates may subsequently elicit a more direct response from them.Elections are a rare opportunity for citizens to shape environmental policy, and focus political attention on the most defining issue of our generation: the climate crisis.Climate change will be related to every social issue on each political party’s manesto – from gender equality to healthcare.Voting for candidates who support ambitious environmental policy solutions is therefore arguably the most important action that citizens can take.Remember this when candidates come calling.Related topicsEdwin PootsClare BaileyClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Edwin PootsFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Greens call for independent environmental agency in NI after Poots announces English office to extend its remit to Northern Ireland PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastEdwin Poots confirmed to replace Christopher Stalford for south Belfast seat PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsMost ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockLatest EnvironmentThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan calls on Stormont to see benefits of city congestion scheme‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentLatestFarmers disappointed at ‘no proposals’ to increase capacity to produce foodJonny Bairstow joins list of England centurions in West IndiesAndrew Marr says he will not buy from chains until they withdraw from RussiaHarry Kane confident Tottenham can compound Manchester United’s miseryCivil case against Andrew comes to a close after settlement is paid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But more compelling is the awareness of how, just a few years ago, all of this valuable material was just dumped into holes in the ground.It’s a filthy business, but far less filthy than the alternative of landfilling the contents of our bins.Anyone who has lived near a municipal dump knows the stench, flies and rats which follow. The toxic nature of much waste means the sites are contaminated for generations, threatening groundwater and wildle.And yet,we all dump our waste into black bins, these sites must go somewhere. It is hypocritical for someone who refuses to recycle to object to a landfill site simply because it is close to their home, rather than close to someone ’s.As recently as , every year we sent , tonnes of municipal waste to landfill by last year that had fallen by %, even though the population increased in that period.Not all the reduction is because of recycling. Just over a decade ago no household waste was incinerated, but now , tonnes are sent abroad each year to be burned to make electricity.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But recycling is the key explanation for the transformation. Driven both by legislative compulsion and growing public awareness of how we are polluting our world and wasting its resources, many people now put more into their recycling bin than into the black bin.Compostable and food waste is now collected separately and used for everything from garden compost to creating gas which can power lorries or make electricity.But what happens when the recyclable material leaves our homes  It is particularly hard to understand how the recyclable items put into blue bins or other comingled recycling bins — where all manner of materials are mixed — can be accurately sorted for processing.In an industrial estate in Mallusk, Bryson Recycling is where that process unfolds for much of the east of Northern Ireland. Bin lorries from five council areas — Belfast Antrim and Newtownabbey Ards and North Down Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid and East Antrim — arrive and leave in a constant stream.Mechanical rams push out each bin lorry’s contents into a hangar. A huge quarry shovel loads it onto a conveyor belt. Plastic bottles explode like fireworks as the vehicle’s heavy wheels drive over the material.The belt carries the waste into the deafening materials recycling facility . The process which follows is surprisingly labour-intensive, as well as using technology to separate the waste.First, a group of workers stand on a raised  and manually lt obvious contaminants from the conveyor belt.Secondly, the belt moves through screens designed to remove paper, which goes to a separate line.The third process involves a magnet that attracts steel cans, such as baked beans tins.That process is then reversed at the fourth stage as the remaining material is subjected to an eddy current that repels aluminium into a chute.The line splits into four conveyors which run through a sorting cabin — the fth stage — where a team of workers pick out materials by hand, aided by a prototype robot that recognises materials and lts then.The sixth stage sees plastics removed using optical sensors which recognise material based on how it reacts to light. A final process involves a worker again manually picking out recyclable items which have been missed.By this stage, more than % of the initial material has been removed. But it’s not perfect. I saw plastic bottles and paper dropping off the end after the final check.The conveyors move quickly and not even all the obviously recyclable material can be caught there is no time to explore items which look unclear. Small items such as bottle tops are particularly unlikely to be correctly identied, falling off the end of the line to be taken for incineration.There are two forms of contamination: material which is wrongly bundled together through the MRF-sorting process [such as plastic in bales of paper], and material which cannot be recycled at all at that facility and so is taken for burning.The contamination at the start of the process stems from a mixture of ignorance of ambiguous rules for what can be recycled in dferent council areas, and deliberate flouting of rules.Claire McCallum has been in the recycling business for two decades at Bryson. “We’ve probably seen nearly everything coming through the doors here,” she tells the Belfast .“We have an ongoing issue with nappies coming through, but also dead animals all sorts of things. We’ve had quite a lot of dead lambs.”Food waste in containers rots, both making the process of hand-sorting more unpleasant and contaminating the final material.What can the public do to help  “I think the best thing people can do is, rather than look at a certain type of material and think ‘oh, that can be recycled’, always check your local council website,” she says.“And the other thing is to ensure things are clean give them a quick rinse before recycling.”But the blue bin comingled recycling is only part of what happens at this facility. Bryson’s own-design vehicles move to another part of the site where no sorting is necessary because the materials have already been sorted manually as they were lted.It is this system Ms McCallum believes is the future.It produces far higher quality materials, almost % pure, rather than some plastic or metal inevitably ending up in a bale of paper. And it uses far less energy, unlike the vast electrical and mechanical demand of the MRF plant.There isn’t just an environmental benefit to the kerbside sorting. Counterintuitively, Bryson says it is also cheaper for ratepayers.“We have been looking at cost analysis and we have worked out thatevery household in Northern Ireland had wheelie boxes, it would save councils about £ million a year,” Ms McCallum says.The costs of sorting the material properly by hand are higher, but the processing costs signicantly less and produces materials which can be sold for a much higher price.So why were councils ever using blue bins  She suspects councils instinctively did so because they had been used to bins and bin lorries, and when told to recycle, they used what was familiar.When asked about this, a spokesman for Nilga, which represents councils here, said the issue was complex, but that the public should try to consume as little materials as possible and recycle the maximum quantity of what they do use.Bryson would like to see a single, consistent approach to recycling across Northern Ireland.Another benefit of improving the quality of recycled materials is that it makes it easier to sell to local firms and improves the quality of their products.Just % of MRF-sorted material stays on the island of Ireland for processing for kerbside-sorted material that figure is %.The high quality, low-contamination materials are not possible through an MRF facility, Ms McCallum says: “You can’t achieve that through recycling through a blue bin system.”Bryson’s plastic, paper and glass is recycled locally, supporting about  jobs and generating around £m a year.The paper is turned into moulded packaging like egg cartons and cup carriers by Huhtamäki in Dollingstown. Glass is melted in a Encirc’s furnace in Derrylin before being turned into bottles for Bailey’s, Bushmills, Fever-Tree, Bottlegreen and other leading drinks brands. Plastic is taken to Cherry Pipes in Dungannon where it is made into civil engineering and agricultural pipes.In one key area, Northern Ireland is now behind the Republic.Last year it became mandatory for recycling companies south of the border to accept ‘soft plastics’ such as the film lids to be recycled.Here that form of plastic makes up much of what still goes into landfill. It is not likely to be collected for recycling locally until .Dealing with waste is complex, but it can be over-complicated by government. For years, as the government prodded people to recycle and cut black bin collections, there was public grumbling.But public opinion has shted rapidly polling now finds public support for recycling.In the post-war decades it was a symbol of society’s growing wealth that a consumer could buy something new, use it for a while and then dump it in landfill because a newer model was available or a minor fault had developed. But that materialistic hedonism has become increasingly uncool.Now people want to recycle more, and do so more easily, but it is government that has not moved to satisfy this desire — either by not collecting basic items such as soft plastic or glass for recycling, or by using a system that will inevitably fail to recover a high percentage of what could be salvaged, and will inevitably contaminate even what is recycled.Stormont and our councils have the power to change this — but may only do sothey believe votes are at stake.Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate Change‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentBuzz words: net zero, a key way to tackle escalating climate changeAsk the expert: How can energy be saved in your home Friends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Most ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for island‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant Latest EnvironmentThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan calls on Stormont to see benefits of city congestion scheme‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentMalachi O#DohertyOpinionA world in which bicycles are king is safer and healthierLatestHome advantage means England’s Joe Marler does not feel like an underdogJonny Bairstow to the rescue for England in AntiguaRoman Abramovich not sold on Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss offer for ChaLib Dems accuse ministers of moving too slowly on Russian oil import banScotland keen to impress in Italy despite absence of Duhan van der Merwe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It also provides other specialist services. Its workload ranges from contracts worth over £m to inidual shop-fits, and its client base ranges from multinationals to smaller private clients.Clients of its fit-out services have included retailers like Hugo Boss and Swarovski.It posted revenues of £.m in , down from more than £m in , but in a dficult year. Its pre-tax profits increased to £,.The new arm will work with existing  —  and new  —  customers across Ireland and the UK to add renewable energy options while also working on construction projects with in built-plans for the use of renewables, including social housing projects here in Northern Ireland.Work will include new builds, refurbishments, modications, rewires and upgrades.Around  new people will come on board and most will receive specialised training.Steve maps out his vision of how Parr Renewables will fit in to the overall organisation. “It is not just about adding, for example, a solar element to the energy mix, though that is important —  it is much wider that that,”  says Steve.It is about the entire fabric of a building, from u PVC, smarts packs and plugs to car charging, window tinting on a sun facing rooms to cut down on air conditioning and a focus on proper insulation, he says.But solar is important and Steve believes the technology is available right now to capture and, crucially, store enough for it to be entirely viable.While it may not be suitable for all builds, specically apartments, it will be an important part of, for example, social housing.The organisation already operates in the social housing sector here, which is taking the lead on introducing a renewable energy element to new builds and modications.But this side of the border is behind efforts in the Republic of Ireland, where all new social housing building must have a renewable element, and there are grants available for that purpose from the government.“We do not have that here, Steve says.Parr#s decision to set up the new arm is part of the overall drive for much more energy efficiency along with switching from fossil fuels to renewables.But it is likely to be a dficult road, particularly when it comes to  electric vehicles, as there is not the infrastructure available to match demand.There is simply not the capacity to accommodate a wholesale switch.Steve cites the example of a major distribution centre where his company installed  EV chargers but all are not in use right now due to the lack of capacity.“The launch of Parr Renewables comes at a time when an increased uptake in renewable energy has never been more vital,” adds  Richard.With the recent surge in fossil fuel prices alongside the targets set for reducing carbon emissions, businesses are facing incredibly challenging times.“We’d already experienced a signicant increase in enquiries from existing customers on what measures they could take to improve their energy efficiency. His team has been working what the company describes as a wide iety of clients, all now engaged in the procurement process and reviewing proposals for renewable installations within their businesses.Most ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for island‘The day my daddy died, my abuser died’ – David Tweed’s daughter reveals horror of abuse in her own wordsTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastPlayVideo: Where does your rubbish go We take a journey with waste inside a Northern Ireland recycling plant Latest EnvironmentThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan calls on Stormont to see benefits of city congestion scheme‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentMalachi O#DohertyOpinionA world in which bicycles are king is safer and healthierLatestHome advantage means England’s Joe Marler does not feel like an underdogJonny Bairstow to the rescue for England in AntiguaRoman Abramovich not sold on Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss offer for ChaLib Dems accuse ministers of moving too slowly on Russian oil import banScotland keen to impress in Italy despite absence of Duhan van der Merwe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is now two years since the Northern Ireland Assembly declared a climate emergency. Similarly, Belfast City Council declared a climate emergency in October .Across Northern Ireland, the average annual land temperature in the decade - was .°C warmer than the period from the mid-s to mid-s. The st century has so far been warmer overall than any of the previous three centuries. Winter  was the third warmest winter for Northern Ireland since .The changes in climate that we are already experiencing are projected to continue and intensy. In the second half of the century, the amount of change that occurs will depend strongly on how successful we are in reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally.Annual temperatures in Northern Ireland are projected to rise by approximately .°C by the s from a - baseline average. Risks associated with rising temperatures, such as more extreme heatwave events causing impacts on people’s health, are likely to become more prevalent as a result of these projections, with their magnitude depending on the degree of change that is experienced.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the time of writing, Northern Ireland remains without a climate bill, although the expectation is that this will soon be resolved. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , led by Environment Minister Edwin Poots, and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey have bills that have reached the consideration stage in the Assembly.Whichever bill emerges, it is clear that signicant change to our socio-economic model needs to occur to reach any of the proposed targets. In , Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be . million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Northern Ireland accounted for % of UK greenhouse gas emissions in , compared to approximately % of the UK population. Agriculture , transportand residential buildingswere the largest sectors in terms of emissions. Mindful of the need to address this and maintain a viable economy, Daera has produced a draft green growth strategy which is about creating more green jobs and protecting or re-purposing existing jobs where possible.An important part of the draft green growth strategy is the new energy strategy from the Department for the Economy. It notes an ambition to deliver energy savings of % from buildings and industry by  and meet at least % of electricity consumption from a erse mix of renewable sources by .While the legislation may be edging forward and strategies are emerging, the current Northern Ireland report within the latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment makes for sobering reading. The Government is required by the Climate Change Act  to conduct such an assessment every five years to inform the UK National Adaptation Plans for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial. The net-zero carbon roadmap produced for Belfast is enlightening in this regard. Currently, % of Belfast’s emissions come from the domestic housing sector, with transport responsible for % of emissions, public and commercial buildings for % and industry %.Belfast’s roadmap includes an assessment of the potential contribution of approximately  energy-saving or low-carbon measures.I don’t think anyone knows where the money is coming from to pay for these initiatives, but it may be the case that a slowness to act has brought us to the point where we can’t quibble on the cost.Andrew Webb is chief economist at Grant ThorntonMost ReadDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockLatest EnvironmentThe cost of going green for homeowners... and how long it could take to get your money backThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan calls on Stormont to see benefits of city congestion scheme‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentLatestFarmers disappointed at ‘no proposals’ to increase capacity to produce foodJonny Bairstow joins list of England centurions in West IndiesAndrew Marr says he will not buy from chains until they withdraw from RussiaHarry Kane confident Tottenham can compound Manchester United’s miseryCivil case against Andrew comes to a close after settlement is paid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, actually, what is so awful about it is that the Speaker of the House of Commons is almost the sort of highest authority here, you know, he or she is responsible for behaviour in the House of Commons, responsible for the way that we run things here.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands. They initiated, researched, wrote and published a recipe book, Food for Friends, in ,with all profits going to the Friends.Many facets of the High Cross project were supported by the Friends, including filming the whole project and the making of the replica High Cross. Restoration of St Patrickrsquos Cross and the interpretation  were financially supported.Exhibitions have benefited from the Friendsrsquo support in recent years with a major contribution to the extension at the back of the site was signicant. This included paintings for the new Tea Room.Talks and lecture series have been organised both in in the museum and at other venues with all profits given to the Friends.And dozens more: from the purchase of trees and shrubs for the garden at the back of the site to the purchase of a Papal bull..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Aontú selects human rights activist to run in Assembly election  ","story":"AONTUacute is fielding a candidate in South Down in the May Assembly election.The party has confirmed that Rosemary McGlone will be its standard bearer when voters go to the polls in  weeksrsquo time to elect five MLAs to represent the constituency.Aontuacute says it views South Down as a key constituency and aims to challenge the Stormont ldquoestablishment parties and provide genuine opposition to the to the broken Stormont system.A nationalist and human rights activist, Ms McGlone is a secondary school teacher in Belfast and a mother of four young children.Her party says that like many nationalists, she felt no longer represented by Sinn Fein or the SDLP and that rather than let herself be disenfranchised with no one to vote for, she has taken a step forward so that people like her might have a voice in Stormont.Aontuacute says that like so many, Rosemary has been ldquofrustrated by Nationalist parties who have abandoned their communities and supported discriminatory policies.It says the final straw for the South Down candidate came when Sinn Feacutein and SDLP MLAs voted for abortion up until birth for children with disabilities. Aontuacute says Rosemary also opposes the de-prioritisation funding of hundreds of local schools that is contained in the Integrated Education Bill.Her party leader, Peader Toacuteibiacuten, said , people are on housing waiting lists, , on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year, a quarter of a million people are in poverty and Sinn Fein and SDLP MLAs have voted for abortion right up until the birth of the child.He declared: ldquoThat the DUP has torn down Stormont in the middle of these very real human crisis is wrong and it must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoAontuacute is the only political party calling for the reform of the democratic institutions to prevent any one party tearing them down again or any one party preventing an Executive being formed in the future.ldquoThese le and death issues are too important for Stormont to be crashed over and over again. We are also calling for the suspension of MLA salaries for the political parties who crash the democratic institutions or prevent Executives being formed.Mr Aontuacute described Ms McGlone as a le-long human rights activist and nationalist who stopped voting for the SDLP because ldquoit abandoned her and so many communities to pursue identity politics.He continued: ldquoRosemary will lead the fight to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who currently have no representation in Co Down. Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill. All students mdash Catholic, Protestant and Integrated mdash should be treated equally.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

Portrush were able to add a fourth goal to their total just before half-time.Unfortunately it didnrsquot take long for Portrush to find the back of the net for their fth of the day after the restart. This came courtesy of a quick attack down the left-hand side before a perfectly placed shot across goal.This didnrsquot stop lsquoHinch fighting for every ball and looking to keep possession. lsquoHinch were able to win several short corners but were unable to convert their chances, due to a strong Portrush defence.When Portrush were able to break in to the lsquoHinch circle they won short corners.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August. Residents would not be able to enjoy their gardens or leave windows openthe track was operating.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Killyleagh community has been urged to help combat at mounting problem of teenage drinking in public and vandalism.The appeal comes from the local Town Committee and follows a special meeting last Wednesday night involving the RUC, councillors and a council official.The townrsquos police sergeant and the three local councillors for the area ndash Mr Sam Osborne, Miss Margaret Ritchie and Mr William Dick ndash attended the meeting to hear complaints from the Town Committee about an upsurge in incidents involving young people.Town Committee secretary, Mrs Joyce McClurg, said many elderly people are terried because of the incidents.

It was ostensibly geared towards announcing the first race meeting at Bishopscourt for  years on March  ndash but as a result of the local controversy which has surrounded the project, they took the opportunity to answer many of the criticisms.Mr Beattie said: ldquoWe believe racing at Bishopscourt will put this end of the county on the map.ARDGLASS ndash A claim has been made this week that Ardglass fishermen will not benefit from a trawler decommissioning scheme announced by the Government.Local SDLP councillor Mr Dermot Curran says Ardglass trawler men will be allowed ldquovery littleany of the pound million which has been earmarked for the scheme.The pound million is intended to over the entire UK fishing fleet over a two-year period. The money will be paid to owners wishing to leave the industry, therefore reducing fishing capacity.Mr Curran said the money on offer is too little to help local fishermen.ldquoThere are  boats in Ardglass. A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the

budgets then staff may be laid off.Addressing his schoolrsquos annual prize distribution on Wednesday night, Mr Hanna said it was wrong for schools to have to make the decision on how many teachers should be employed and their levels of pay.ldquoOn introduction the Government was at great pains to assure us that the purpose of LMS was to enable schools to decide their own priorities in the allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching unions and their demands for better promotion prospects and smaller classes, and it decided to off-load the problems, via LMS, on to inidual schools who now have to take the decision about class size, the number of teachers to be employed and their levels of pay, he added.SEAFORDE ndash A new phase in the drive to plant one million new trees in Northern Ireland was officially launched at a

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy. I am pleased that Downpatrick area councillors can work collectively for progress in the area, she added.Itrsquos understood that details of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised and that once the date of the K event has been confirmed, the event will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, those working to bring the event to Downpatrick say it has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost, bringing in many competitors from outside the town.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Recovery is possible to restore bond with you and eating food  ","story":"WITH the pandemic dictating to us over the last two years, there has been an increase for those struggling to manage their dficult feelings, sudden le changes, isolation and trying to gain a sense of control mdash which has resulted in an increase of cases for the treatment of eating disorders.Eating disorders, or a disordered pattern of eating, can arise when a person uses food to cope with painful situations or uncomfortable feelings.Problems with food develop when it is used for emotional rather than physical reasons, such as feelings of anxiety, anger or guilt. The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

Their production is an echo of the old industrial output of businesses such as Harland and Wolff, which constructed some of the finest ships that ever set sail.It is encouraging to hear Mr Khan, like Mr Johnson and other visitors to Wrightbus such as the former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, talk of the bus orders in terms of a UK perspective, in which the regions and their connection to Britain’s biggest city are celebrated.It is a pity though that the shipping or automotive industries in the UK are not what they might be, given the way that more amorphous sectors such as services have become so dominant to the overall economy.It is even more of a pity that UK manufacturing of objects for use in a city where in the UK now has to navigate an obstacle to movement of goods and parts within the nation.Removing that barrier, the Northern Ireland Protocol, is essential.

The chanting of hate-filled pro-IRA propaganda by GAA supporters routinely surfaces on social media. If, as Ruth Dudley Edwards suggests, the GAA feels embarrassed by having Sinn Fein unveil a monument to IRA terrorists at one of their clubs, they keep it well hidden. Their statement that they “...will work on issuing guidance to clubs and counties on such events in the future” downplays the offence that such “events” engender within all right-minded people. However, until the GAA complete their “work” they should issue a clear unequivocal statement that anyone who supports, justies or celebrates violence inflicted in furtherance of political objectives — past, present or future — is unwelcome within the GAA.

Because there are serious questions to be asked about the Irish government at the time of the bomb. “Those that planned, made, transported and exploded that bomb spent only  minutes in Northern Ireland when they attacked Omagh. About % of the Omagh bomb plot and its aftermath took place south of the border.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This will include a regular annual vacination programme, the Welsh Government has said.: Three Covid deaths reported in Wales - more than  new cases in Gwent.It comes as Mr Drakeford has said that Wales will remain at alert level zero for the next three weeks, with no further changes to Covid regulations planned before March .Then, all legal measures could be removed, should the public health situation remain stable, the first minister said.“We’ve been living in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic for two long years,” he said. “It has touched all our lives – across Wales, families and communities have made many sacrices to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. People in Wales have followed the rules.“But sadly, too many families have experienced the pain of losing a loved one or a close friend. My thoughts are with them all.“As we publish this longer-term plan, there is no doubt we have reached a signicant moment in this pandemic and we can look to the future with growing confidence that the next year will be one in which we have a dferent relationship with the virus.“This has been made possible by the hard work of everyone and by the efforts of all the health and care staff, public sector workers and volunteers who have done so much over the last two years..remove“But the pandemic isn’t over – this virus is full of nasty surprises and we are likely to see fluctuations in global patterns of infection for several years.“We need to be ready to respond quickly to any future outbreaks or new iants as we learn to live safely alongside coronavirus in the long-term.“We have learned so much over the last two years and we need to harness this as we look forward to a safer and brighter future together.”Together for a Safer Future: Wales’ Long-term Covid- Transition from Pandemic to Endemic will set out a gradual transition away from emergency measures using two core scenarios – Covid Stable and Covid Urgent.Covid Stable – the most likely scenario – is where Wales may encounter new waves of infection, but they are not expected to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS, due to the effectiveness of vaccines and other treatments, such as new Covid- antivirals.The Welsh Government has said this will include vaccination boosters in the spring for  the elderly and most vulnerable adults, and a regular autumn vaccination programme. The Test, Trace, Protect proramme will also move to a more targeted approach aimed at vulnerable people.Planning is also under way for a Covid-Urgent scenario, to allow for the Welsh Government and other public services to quickly respond to situations such as a new iant which evades the vaccine.The next review of restrictions will be carried out by March . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Consumers were uncertain about the outlook and an affordable iPhone was ideally placed to take advantage of that.“In  things have improved but the iPhone SE franchise still fills an important role as an affordable iPhone for consumers still cautious about splashing out on a top-of-the-line iPhone or who just don’t feel the need to spend more than is necessary.”Elsewhere at its latest event, Apple announced a new desktop computer, the Mac Studio and a companion screen – the -inch Studio Display – as a new flagship device for power users..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Apple’s new Mac Studio desktop computer and Studio Display monitor The computer will be the first to house the company’s latest own made computer chip – the M Ultra – which the firm says is the most powerful ever built for a personal computer.With the new M Ultra in place, Apple says the Mac Studio is nearly four times faster than its fastest iMac desktop computer.Starting at £, it comes with a number of dferent ports to enable connection with a broad range of other devices, including the new Studio Display monitor, which has a -inch screen and can support K resolution.The new monitor will cost £, Apple confirmed.The virtual event also saw Apple update the iPad Air tablet, placing its M chip into the device for a % performance increase on the previous generation, adding G connectivity, as well as an improved camera that includes Apple’s Centre Stage feature for video calls, which uses AI to automatically pan and keep those talking on the call in view.The iPhone  and  Pro devices are to be made available in a new green finish too, with all the new products announced going on sale on March ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Apple reveals new  uaffordable u iPhone SE article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

While the new SE offers storage of up to GB like its predecessor, it now carries the same A Bionic chip as last year’s hugely popular iPhone .“This more powerful and efficient chip should improve the quality of pictures and video and deliver longer battery le.“As the lowest-priced iPhone to offer G, the SE stands to be a popular work phone choice.“And with UK operators closing their G networks from next year, the handset will also be a tempting option for those who want to future-proof their communications.“Smartphone users who want an economic option while staying loyal to iOS will find the SE hard to resist.”Fellow industry expert, Ben Wood, from CCS Insight agreed, saying that the power built into the new SE made a formidable device against its rivals.“Apple’s decision to use its A Bionic chipset in the iPhone SE contrasts the approach taken by rival smartphone makers who tend to use less powerful chipsets in cheaper devices,” he said..remove“However, at £, the iPhone SE is a long way from the sub  dollars G Android smartphones currently offered by several Chinese manufacturers – Apple’s entry-level iPhone would be considered a flagship product by many rival manufacturers.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Apple  ulooking to dominate budget smartphone market u with new iPhone SE article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Clarence House declined to comment as to whether Charles had helped his brother with the payment..removeMs Giuffre was suing Andrew for sexual abuse, saying the duke had sex with her when she was  and had been trafficked by his friend, the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew, who has stepped down from royal duties and public le, claimed he has never met Ms Giuffre, but went on to avert a looming trial by agreeing a settlement last month.The Queen had already taken steps to distance the royal family from Andrew and protect the monarchy brand.She stripped him of his honorary military roles in January, with the duke also giving up using his HRH – a style he was born with. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen and the Duke of York The legal document from Ms Giuffre and the duke’s legal team read: “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure , and the parties’ settlement agreement dated February  , Plaintf Virginia L. Giuffre and Defendant Prince Andrew, Duke of York hereby stipulate to the dismissal of this action, with prejudice.“Each party to bear her his own costs and fees.”Andrew is reportedly in the process of selling his Swiss ski chalet, with the property expected to generate many millions in funds.The duke was forced to step down from public duties in  amid the scandal surrounding his association with Epstein.Andrew’s disastrous Newsnight interview sealed his fate when he was accused of lacking empathy for Epstein’s victims and of failing to show regret over his friendship with the disgraced financier.Ms Giuffre started legal action against the duke in August, saying it was “past the time for him to be held to account” for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.She alleges she was sexually abused while aged under  by Andrew at Ghislaine Maxwell’s home in London, at Epstein’s New York mansion and on Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Civil case against Andrew comes to a close after settlement is paid article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySpurs head to Old Trafford for a crunch clash in the race for Champions League qualication and the two sides could not have had dfering results over the footballing weekend.Kane put in a dazzling two-goal display as Antonio Conte’s side beat Everton - on Monday night while United were hammered - in the Manchester derby, prompting inquests that will go on for most of the week.The England captain is wary of a response but says there is a chance to earn a win that would see his side climb above United in the league and also have two games in hand.Kane said: “United are still one of the best teams in the league. Obviously they have come off a disappointing result at the weekend.“There is always going to be a reaction and a bounce-back from their players and we need to make sure we are ready for that.“We obviously feel that there is an opportunity for us there because we have had a great result and we could try to use that momentum, especially away from home, against their crowd.“But it will be a tough game. They have got some great players. They beat us earlier on in the season quite comfortably. We have got to have all that in our heads, we have got to make sure we go with the right mindset – it’s a game we are looking forward to.“Old Trafford away is one of the best games you play in the league and you have got to be excited. You have got to go there and try to be free and put in another good performance.”Tottenham’s biggest Achilles heel lately has been their inability to string a run of results together – they followed up an impressive win at Manchester City with defeats at Burnley and in the FA Cup at Middlesbrough.They were back to their best against an albeit woeful Everton and Kane says the result and the performance was up there with the best in recent years.“There have been high performances all round – not just me but the whole team played really, really well,” he said. “It’s hard to say it is the best football we have played – we have had some great managers over the years and played some great football..remove“But beating Everton - and beating City away from home are right up there – fantastic results. And results that should give us confidence.“But like I said, and the manager said, we still need to keep improving and we still need to keep working hard. It is great having nights like this but we’ve got to prove ourselves over the last  games.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Harry Kane confident Tottenham can compound Manchester United us misery article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced on Tuesday the UK will phase out the import of Russian oil and oil products by the end of the year in a move matched by US President Joe Biden.It comes as the West looks to tighten the squeeze on the Russian economy following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.The Liberal Democrats criticised the Government for “moving too slowly” on punishing President Vladimir Putin, while several experts cast doubt over how effective such sanctions will be.Labour welcomed the Government’s move as “the right decision”, but called for further action to tackle the cost of living crisis and to move towards clean energy.Sir Ed said: “The Conservatives are once again moving far too slowly to punish Putin for his illegal invasion of Ukraine.“It’s not good enough to only ban Russian oil, there must be a ban on Russian gas too.”He said the invasion of Ukraine highlighted how Europe was “too dependent” on Russia and that the continent needs to invest in renewables to “end Europe’s addiction to Russian fossil fuels”.Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “It is the right decision to ban imports of Russian oil. We need to do everything possible to isolate the Putin regime.”But he added the decision now “reinforces the case for further action to tackle the cost of living crisis” in the UK as well as “underlines the need for a decisive move towards clean energy”.Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy tweeted: “It’s right that the UK will phase out imports of Russian oil.“We need to do everything possible to cut the Putin, his cronies and the rogue Russian regime out of our economic system.”Boris Johnson suggested diesel prices could be set to rise further in Britain after the announcement, with prices at the pumps already having soared following Moscow’s attack on Kyiv..removeBut the Prime Minister said the UK was “less exposed” than some European nations when it came to restricting Russian oil – the European Union imports more than a quarter of its oil from Russia.Speaking to broadcasters in London, Mr Johnson accepted the decision to target Moscow’s oil would not hit the Kremlin’s regime immediately, with Ukraine continuing to face assault, but said it would add to the “extreme” sanctions already levied.The UK imported goods from Russia worth a total of £. billion in , according to the Office for National Statistics .This was the equivalent of % of the total value of all imported goods from around the world.No UK petrol demand comes from Russia, nor heating or fuel oil but % of the total demand for diesel comes from Russia, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Tom Keatinge, director of the RUSI Centre for financial crime and security studies, told the Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday that unless the EU imposed similar sanctions on Russia, UK and US sanctions could merely push up prices.He said: “Someone pointed out to me yesterday that the rate at which commodity prices are rising at the moment, actually, Russia could sell a lot less but still earn just as much money.”Justine Walker, global head of sanctions, compliance and risk at the Association of Certied Anti-Money Laundering Specialists, said: “If we’re to target oil, then I think there needs to be a much broader consensus.“If you just have the US targeting oil or the UK targeting oil, then you are, as Tom says, you’re just going to drive up prices and actually will not be effective.”Askedthis meant there was no point in imposing the sanctions without a broader international consensus from other players like the EU, Mr Keatinge said: “I think we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact, price is obviously aof supply and demand.“So what are we doing to work with suppliers to replace the capacity that gets lost from from from Russia – but clearly the EU needs to buy into that strategy.”Meanwhile, Dr Chi Kong Chyong from the Energy Policy Research Group at Cambridge Judge Business School, warned that stopping the flow of Russian oil and gas into Europe may not be the “hammer blow” that Western countries are looking for.In an article published to the University of Cambridge website on Tuesday, he said: “Europe is part of a global, increasingly commoditised market, in which trade embargoes by one region will not be effectiveothers don’t follow.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Lib Dems accuse ministers of moving too slowly on Russian oil import ban article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
