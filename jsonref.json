He has long campaigned for a register of overseas entities requiring foreign owners of property in the UK to declare their true identity, which is only now being brought forward as part of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill.Other measures contained in the legislation, which went through the Commons in a day, include removing barriers to using unexplained wealth orders and strengthening the sanctions regime.Lord Faulks said: \u0027We of course understand why this Bill is being rushed through Parliament, but what I fail to understand is why the Government has taken so long to respond to what what was staring them in the face.\u0027 He added: \u0027We have allowed ourselves to be the receiver of stolen goods in this country.\u0027Lord Faulks referred to former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko who died in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210, while the Salisbury chemical weapons attack in 2018 killed Dawn Sturgess.He said: \u0027Reputable sources suggest that as many as 10 or more murders are attributable to Russia. Ukraine is not our fault, but we have embraced the Russian oligarchs and the henchmen of Putin.\u0027 He added: \u0027It (the Bill) contains some useful provisions and I thoroughly support them.

Photograph: iStockThe State will pay rent to the Catholic Church for its schools that transfer to multi-denominational patrons under new 40-year leases.The arrangement forms part of a Department of Education deal with Catholic bishops aimed at giving greater choice in primary education for families.Catholic schools account for 89 per cent of primary schools, while about 5 per cent have a multi-denominational ethos.Under the deal, the church would retain ownership of schools and receive “appropriate” rents which take into account the fact that schools may have benefitted from State capital investment in the past.The insurance premium for school buildings also forms part of the leasing arrangement, as well as contributions to legal costs involved in securing any State interest in the property.The department should, where possible, have the option of extending any leases or purchasing school properties if they are put up for sale in future.The department said commercial rents are not appropriate due to the educational use of the properties and a “reasonable” rent should be agreed.The Government has previously been criticised for its slow progress in providing access to multi-denominational education.Pilot areasOnly 20 or more formerly Catholic primary schools have been ested or reconfigured as multi-denominational schools since 2012.The Programme for Government commits to improving parental choice by meeting a target of delivering 400 multi-denominational primary schools by 2030. Latest figures show there are 164 multi-denominational schools.Under a new deal, Catholic bishops will “co-operate fully” with the department in seeking to facilitate a more erse school patronage in eight pilot areas where there are no multi-denominational primary schools. The pilot areas are Arklow, Athlone, Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick and Youghal.The department said it will make available “independent facilitators” to work with school patrons and school authorities at a local level.They will help identify potential schools and engage with school staff and parents, with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there is demand.Minister for Education Norma Foley said the learning from these pilots will inform the process in other areas of the country.“I acknowledge the significant contribution that the Catholic Church has made, and continues to make, to the Irish education system. The department and the church recognise that there is a need for further progress in terms of visible and tangible change to provide more options of multi-denominational provision for parents,” she said.The patronage of many Catholic schools that reopen as multi-denominational is likely to transfer to State-owned Education and Training Boards.It is the patron to Community National Schools, which are multi-denominational in ethos.Earlier this week, Educate Together – another multi-denominational patron – said it was seeking reassurance from the department that parents will be consulted and provided with accurate information for the reconfiguration of future schools.It said it had been excluded from the reconfiguration of a Catholic school in Nenagh, Co Tipperary, despite surveys indicating it was the patron of choice among parents."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"\u0026ldquoWindthrow is now the greatest threat to economic forestry in IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"fuel industry accuses government of misleading public on price drops","story":"Fuel providers received sharp criticism as prices for petrol and diesel failed to drop on Thursday. Photograph Nick BradshawThe representative body for petrol stations and fuel providers has accused the Government of “misleading” the public, to believe the price of fuel would drop as soon as excise cuts came into effect. Excise cuts of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent for diesel came into effect from midnight on Wednesday, as part of Government efforts to curb a sharp increase in fuel costs linked to the war in Ukraine.Fuel providers received sharp criticism as prices for petrol and diesel failed to drop on Thursday. Kevin McPartlan, chief executive of Fuels for Ireland, said it was “misleading” to suggest providers had been “engaged in any sort of profiteering”. “These times are made even more challenging when misleading comments find their way into the public domain,” he wrote. The industry representative said the Government had given the public the “false impression” that prices at the pump would reduce from midnight on Wednesday, when the excise cuts came into effect. “This was simply never going to be the case, and was flagged in advance, given that excise has already been paid on supplies presently on forecourts,” he said. “It has given people a false impression that prices would reduce immediately, which was impossible as excise on those supplies had already been paid,” he wrote. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has been called on to investigate alleged price hikes by fuel providers just before the excise cuts came into effect, with both Opposition and Government TDs criticising the increases. The consumer watchdog has said there were “no legal barriers” to filling stations independently raising prices, and it required evidence of cartel behaviour before launching an investigation.‘Reprehensible’Ministers are to meet with Mr McPartlan, as well as executives from several fuel providers on Friday afternoon. It is expected the meeting will be attended by Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath, Minister of State for Enterprise Robert Troy, and Minister of State for Retail Damien English. The time of the meeting is to be finalised, but it is understood it may be after 3pm. Speaking at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting on Thursday evening, Mr Martin said reports of profiteering around rising fuel prices was “completely unacceptable,” and any exploitation of the war in Ukraine was “morally reprehensible”. In his correspondence to Mr Martin afterwards, Mr McPartlan said the comments were of “great concern,” and suggestions petrol stations were profiteering was “offensive”. The industry would “continue to transact our business ethically and in an open and transparent fashion,” he said. It would also defend itself against “faulty assumptions as to our industry’s ethics of operation,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"north korea tests intercontinental ballistic missile as leader expands space effort","story":"The Hwasong-17 would be North Korea’s longest-range weapon, carried on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, with some analysts calling it a ‘monster’. Photograph: Korean Central News AgencyKorea News Service via APNorth Korea recently used what would be its largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system in two secretive launches, likely paving the way for a resumption of long-range tests, US and South Korean officials said.North Korea froze its ICBM and nuclear tests in 2017 after launching its first missiles capable of reaching the United States. It has also not tested a nuclear weapon since then but leader Kim Jong Un has warned of a return to testing both.The escalation in North Korea tensions comes as South Korea on Wednesday elected a new conservative president.Yoon Suk-yeol has said preemptive strikes may be needed to counter any imminent attack by the North and has vowed to buy American THAAD missile interceptors, while remaining open to restarting stalled denuclearisation talks.TestsIn launches on February 27th and March 5th, North Korea did not specify what missile was used, but said they tested components for reconnaissance satellites Kim said would soon be launched to monitor military activity by the United States and its allies.“The purpose of these tests, which did not demonstrate ICBM range, was likely to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future, potentially disguised as a space launch,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.The US Treasury, which has imposed a range of sanctions on North Korea over its weapons programmes, will announce new actions on Friday to help prevent North Korea “accessing foreign items and technology that enable it to advance its weapons programmes,” a senior US administration official told reporters in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.These steps would be followed by a range of further actions in coming days, the official added, without giving any details of the measures.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Yoon said they had agreed to ramp up three-way ties with the United States in responding to North Korea’s evolving military threat.Japan is also considering imposing additional sanctions against North Korea, as well as other diplomatic options, Kishida told reporters after a phone call with the South Korean president-elect.MissilesThe United States and South Korea both said the missile system, known as the Hwasong-17, was unveiled at an October 2020 military parade in Pyongyang and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021.The Hwasong-17 would be North Korea’s longest-range weapon, carried on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, with some analysts calling it a “monster”.Analysts said the tests likely used only one stage of the Hwasong-17, and may have adjusted its fuel use to fly at lower altitudes.Washington called the ICBM tests a “serious escalation requiring a united global response”. Seoul issued strong condemnation and urged Pyongyang to immediately stop actions that heighten tension.The intelligence assessments, released simultaneously by the United States and South Korea, came as North Korean state media reported Kim had inspected the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground.The facility has been used to put a satellite in orbit and also to test various missile components including rocket engines and space launch vehicles that South Korean and US. officials say require similar technology to that used in ICBMs.North Korea “has historically used its space launches to try to hide its attempted advancements of its ICBM programme”, the US official told reporters.At the Sohae station, Kim inspected facilities and ordered modernising and expanding it to ensure that “various rockets could be launched to carry multi-purpose satellites, including a military reconnaissance satellite,” the North’s KCNA news agency reported.“I think that the North Koreans are genuinely working on a set of technologies that have applications across both ICBMs and satellites,” said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US – based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.South Korea’s unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said it was monitoring Kim’s movements and urged North Korea to refrain from further stoking tension.Stay on top of the latest news with our

may never be resolved, a report from the Whitehall spending watchdog has warned.In a scathing report, the National Audit Office (NAO) said that the £5.5 billion project was “flawed from the start”, and that the Ministry of Defence failed to understand the scale and complexity of the work it was undertaking.It added that delays to the programme, which is already more than four years behind schedule, could now jeopardise plans to restructure the Army around a new generation of digitally enabled armoured fighting vehicles.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “A series of failures have led to delays and unresolved safety issues that will have a significant impact on the Army’s ability to use the vehicles.”Ministers publicly acknowledged last year that the programme was in trouble. They included problems with excessive noise and vibration, which have left dozens of troops needing urgent hearing assessments after taking part in trials on the vehicles.General Dynamics UK was contracted to supply 589 Ajax armoured vehicles, which were originally supposed to enter service in 2017. However, despite receiving more than £3 billion, only 26 have been delivered so far.Vibration issues ‘pose a significant risk’The NAO said that the concerns about noise and vibration have still to be resolved, and continued to represent a “significant risk” to the programme.While trials with Army crews have been halted, the NAO said that the company has continued production without receiving any payment in 2021.However, the Ministry of Defence has yet to set a revised date to get the first tranche into service and has no confidence that an April 2025 target date for the full operating capability can be met.The Army has to rely on its ageing fleet of Warrior armoured fighting vehicles as a result.“It is not yet clear whether the programme’s issues are resolvable,” the NAO said.‘Everything that can go wrong did go wrong’Dame Meg Hillier, the chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: “The NAO report reads like a checklist for major project failure where almost everything that can go wrong did go wrong.“It means Ajax has now joined the sorry pantheon of government projects which have gone off the tracks.”She added: “The Army is forced to continue using increasingly old and obsolete equipment which, aside from adding cost, reduces our capability at a time when dangers are only increasing.“Both parties must find a way out of the deadlock, work together to rescue the programme and ensure the Army gets the equipment it needs.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia could be preparing for renewed offensive, warns MoDPolitics latest news: Russia warned of \u0026#39dramatic increased response\u0026#39 from the West if chemical weapons are used in UkraineUkraine footage: Watch the moments of hope amid war with RussiaRussian airstrikes hit four Ukrainian cities in escalated air campaignHoli Festival 2022: How the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"The British public will be asked to offer homes to tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion under plans to be announced this weekend. Ministers will launch a hotline and webpage enabling iniduals, charities, businesses and community groups to offer rooms to refugees with no family links to the UK. The move follows criticism of the Home Office\u0027s chaotic rollout of its scheme for Ukrainian refugees with family in the UK, which has led to delays and complaints of excessive bureaucracy. In the Commons, Priti Patel avoided the scowls of the opposition bench and kept her eyes rigidly glued to her script as she announced a new streamlined approach to refugees. Madeline Grant sketches how the Home Secretary, floating like a butterfly, stung like a bee, channelled her inner Muhammad Ali. Helen Brown interviews mother of three Jo Cope, who tells how she discovered getting a visa is harder than fleeing war after she saved a friend\u0027s children from Ukraine.On the front line, a Russian armoured column trying to get into Kyiv was pushed back in a devastating strike from Ukrainian forces.Video posted on Twitter of footage seemingly shot from a drone shows the line of around 30 tanks and armoured vehicles, including a TOS-1 Thermobaric missile launcher.At least three vehicles were destroyed in what has been assessed as an artillery strike by Ukraine, with the others turning around to get out of the contact zone. Defence watchers criticised the Russian column for displaying poor tactics. Meanwhile, over in the Zaporizhzhya military hospital, the casualties arrive at all times of day or night. Roland Oliphant spoke to Dr Viktor Pysanko, who has been saving lives on both sides but describes a scene that really is war like the First World War or the Second World War. Follow the latest in our liveblog.

Heavily pregnant women, and new mothers clutching babies, were escorted from the blackened ruins of a maternity hospital in Mariupol that had been destroyed by an airstrike, in which three people were killed. They were the sort of unforgettable photographs that can come to define a war. Proof, if it were needed, that Russia is waging war not on the army, but on Ukraine itself.One woman was apparently unmoved, however: Maria Zakharova, director of the information and press department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Putin’s inscrutable spokesman. Asked about the attack in a press briefing, she went on the offensive. “This is information terrorism,” she said, claiming that Ukrainian reports about the airstrike were fake. This followed her earlier claims that Ukraine was developing biological weapons.To the unfamiliar, Zakharova’s sinister tone might seem shocking, but there is nothing new about it. She is merely the most prominent soldier in a clone army of media savvy Russian women who have taken on the job of lying for the Putin regime. They do it in fluent English, with apparent relish, and there are seemingly no depths to which they will not stoop. It may still be men driving the tanks and jumping out of planes. But in the new propaganda war, Putin’s elite shock troops are women. In a country that was used to government press briefings being conducted by dry men in drab suits, these women, with their swashbuckling style and salty jokes, as well as bright lipstick, big hair and sharp outfits, have been a breath of fresh air. Zakharova’s briefings have become must-watch events, amassing millions of views on YouTube.  A mixture of steel and showbiz has turned these women into celebrities. Who cares if they are doing the devil’s work?Yet Putin is far from the only authoritarian world leader to have employed smart women to help with his messaging. Between 2017 and 2020, Donald Trump used his political adviser Kellyanne Conway to similar effect, often via Fox News. It was Conway who defended then-press secretary Sean Spicer’s use of “alternative facts,” and who invented a fictitious atrocity, the Bowling Green Massacre, to defend the president’s immigration ban. For decades before she retired, the North Korean newsreader Ri Chun-hee, sometimes called the “Pink Lady” for her brightly coloured outfits, delivered national news – about nuclear developments or the ongoing success of the leadership – in stern, sometimes melodramatic tones. “I don’t know if Putin and these other leaders are deliberately choosing women, or if it’s simply that they are the best people for the job,” says Jo Tanner, a communications consultant and former adviser to Boris Johnson. “Possibly there’s a macho element in these male leaders choosing female spokeswomen. “I can see the logic of putting up a woman to defend an attack on a maternity hospital. You would be trying to take away the hard edges. But Zakharova is pretty robust in her delivery.” So much so that she, along with Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of broadcaster RT (formerly Russia Today), have been put on the EU sanctions list alongside oligarchs – Zakharova for having “promoted the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine”.Simonyan first came to attention in the UK in 2018 when she conducted the bizarre interview with the Salisbury Novichok poisoners, in which they claimed to be a friendly gay couple who had simply visited the town in order to see the cathedral’s “famous 123m spire”.  When she was asked how she felt about being sanctioned by the EU, she replied sarcastically, “Maria Zakharova and I took out handkerchiefs,” in order to “have a little cry.” Then there is Maria Butina, who was convicted of spying for Russia against the US in 2018, and now serves in the State Duma. On Wednesday, in a Today interview with Nick Robinson that sent marmalade spiralling from spoons all over Britain, she claimed that Ukrainians were shelling themselves. Nor should we forget Anna Chapman, the flame haired former spy, who found time this week to come out in support of the war, in between flogging children’s clothes on Instagram. Senator and government spokesman Valentina Matviyenko, meanwhile, claims that the invasion was the “only way to stop a brotherly war”. Jo Tanner says it’s a moot point whether these women are party to their own lies. “Internally, these spokespeople are playing on the fact that their own people have limited access to other sources of information,” she says. “The whole invasion is based on a complete lie, and is being fuelled by a continuation of that. You would hope that the spokespeople are being duped and they don’t know the truth when they’re delivering it. But you have to question that. They are cultured people doing these jobs. They must be able to see the other sources of information around the world, contradicting what they are saying.” Although Putin’s female mouthpieces have come up via different routes, they have in common conservative views and a history of unswerving loyalty to the chief. Simonyan was a Kremlin reporter, cutting her teeth during the Chechen War before being made editor of Russia Today when she was just 25. “She has a strong journalistic background,” says Emily Ferris, a research fellow at Rusi, a think tank, who specialises in Russia and Eurasia. “She was part of the Kremlin press pack. She proved that she was someone who could be trusted.” Butina was an assistant for Aleksandr Torshin, a Putin ally, who was sent to infiltrate American institutions, including the NRA, in the run-up to the 2016 election. Matviyenko is a longtime Putin loyalist, something which helped her become the first female leader of St Petersburg.Perhaps the most interesting is Zakharova, with the CV that could have taken her anywhere. Her mother was an art historian and her father was Russia’s ambassador to Beijing, where the family lived for 10 years, as a result of which Zakharova speaks fluent Chinese. She has the Russian equivalent of a PhD. “Zakharova is particularly aggressive against the West, which I think some Russians might view as a display of strength” says Ferris. “But Russia is still a pretty misogynistic country, and she also counters a lot of traditional visions of how women should be. I wouldn’t say I admire her, exactly, but it’s very difficult to be a woman in that role.” Sometimes called Putin’s “troll-in-chief”, Zakharova has built a reputation as one of the Russian president’s most combative outriders, unafraid to take the fight to the press. At one notorious briefing in 2018, she confronted a Finnish journalist who had dared to ask about an anti-LGBT campaign being prosecuted in Chechnya by its leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. Stepping out from behind her lectern, Zakharova suggested that the journalist might go and see for himself. “You’re not afraid, are you?” she said. “We’re not joking.” Then she winked. “It was very awkward and uncomfortable,” Erkka Mikkonen told reporters afterwards. “It was like getting called out by the teacher in school. She was trying to make me feel like an idiot.”“She really likes her job she gets a kick out of what she does,” Aleksey Maslov, an economics professor who taught Zakharova in the early Noughties, told Buzzfeed. “She has turned PR management for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs into high theatre.” “Partly these roles have ended up being filled by women because they are less prestigious than the big internal jobs,” says Mark Galeotti, a professor at UCL who specialises in Russia. “But there’s also an awareness that a succession of dull apparatchiks in grey suits didn’t work at punching up the message. Whereas the Zakharovas of the world absolutely get the coverage and the attention. It’s Ann Coulter syndrome.  “Their roles mean that a lot of these women are more famous outside of Russia than at home,” he says. “Butina was a kind of accidental celebrity. Simonyan is a shrewd careerist, with an eye for what will catch people’s attention. It’s hard to know what she believes in her heart of hearts, but at a certain point you make your choices. “Zakharova is probably a different case. She enjoys the combative nature of her job. My sense is that she absolutely believes what she’s saying.” These women are also proof that for a certain kind of ambitious young woman, the Kremlin can offer a path to the top faster than the private sector. “It’s not equal opportunities, exactly,” says Galeotti. “But the Kremlin is interested in tapping whatever human resources it has. Leave your morals at the door, and it helps if you’re attractive.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia could be preparing for renewed offensive, warns MoDPolitics latest news: Russia warned of \u0026#39dramatic increased response\u0026#39 from the West if chemical weapons are used in UkraineUkraine footage: Watch the moments of hope amid war with RussiaRussian airstrikes hit four Ukrainian cities in escalated air campaignHoli Festival 2022: How the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british army numbers plunge more","story":"British Army numbers plunge by more than , in just three months, figures revealThe Government has abandoned a pledge to maintain the size of the Regular Army at , and will let it dwindle to , - making it the smallest Army for  years.

Shadow Defence Minister Luke Pollard said: “Conservative ministers have cut the British Army to its smallest size in  years, with frontline troops bearing the brunt of these cuts. Our Armed Forces are essential to our national security and resilience. “With growing Russian aggression, the Government is pushing ahead with further cuts to the Army by , troops over the next three years. “Ministers must halt these cuts now. Labour also expects a big boost for defence spending in the Chancellor’s upcoming budget.”It comes as Keir Starmer today told Nato troops in Estonia “the eyes of the world are upon you”. Visiting a Tapa military base with shadow defence secretary John Healey, he thanked soldiers for providing “reassurance” through their presence at the base in the country bordering Russia.He added that “there is no time for party politics” because the world faces “a very grave situation” amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. A small number of serving British personnel are believed to have gone absent without leave to join the fight against the Russian invasion. Boris Johnson warned they would face court martial on theirto the UK, as Ministry of Defence chiefs have banned all service personnel from travelling to Ukraine “until further notice”.Armed forces minister James Heappey said earlier this week: “It is illegal for British service personnel to first of all go absent without leave in the first place, but to go absent without leave in order to fight in a foreign war is simply unacceptable, and frankly risks the United Kingdom being wrongly claimed by Russia to be a belligerent in this. “Service people who might think they are doing the right thing should reflect it is % not the correct thing to be doing.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBritish ArmySoldiersWar crimesCrimePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Days after the party fundraiser, on July , , the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines flight  was shot down by a surface to air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.And just months earlier, Putin had faced international condemnation over the annexation of Crimea.But speaking to LBC Radio’s Andrew Marr today, the former PM insisted Mrs Chernukhin had attempted “absolutely no influence” on UK policies on Russia.Askedhe remembered the game, he said: “I do, I remember - and there was absolutely no conversation about Russia, finance, Putin or anything .”  “We had a very careful system for vetting who could and could not give money to the Conservative Party. “A small handful of people had any connections with Russia, and as I’m concerned most of them were dissidents, often Ukrainians.” Mrs Chernukhin was born in Russia, studied in the United States and became a British citizen in . She is legally eligible to vote and make donations to UK political parties, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part.Ms Chernukhin has repeatedly paid for access to successive Prime Ministers ministers in Party fundraising auctions, including a ‘girl’s night out’ with Theresa May and Liz Truss, dinner with then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and a second tennis match with Boris Johnson, after he became Prime Minister.In total Ms Chernukhin has given almost £ million to the Conservatives - and is the biggest female political donor in British history.Mr Cameron went on: “But crucially, this point - Britain had the strongest anti-Putin policy of any country in Europe. “Who threw him out of the G  Who insisted on the sanctions  Who passed the rules on beneficial ownership  “So I think it’s a giant red herring to suggest in some way that Russian money somehow influenced policy against Putin and Russia.” He added he was the “strongest ally in building a really robust case in holding Putin to account.”  Asked what Mrs Chernukhin and other Russian expat donors were paying for when they gave money to the party, he replied: “Like many people who come and live in this country and make it their home, they get involved in politics because they care about this country, and making sure it’s an open, tolerant and democratic country.” He said there was “absolutely no influence” on the UK’s Russia policies adding: “If they were trying to buy something, they didn’t really get it, did they ” On Tuesday evening, Mrs Chernukhin was given the Award of St Agnes, one of most prestigious honours handed out by the Republic of San Marino at a ceremony in London. The event was attended by a high-level government delegation from the micro-country, including Captains Regent Francesco Mussoni and Giacomo Simoncini, the dual heads of state. Tory MP Andrew Rossindell, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on San Marino, attended the event and gave a speech.

But they do not single out the Prime Ministers behaviourBoris Johnson at a No press conference the day before the lockdown Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsThe government today announced the full list of issues that will be covered by the Covid public inquiry. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry last year after fury at his slow decisions to lock down, which scientists believe cost lives.It will start hearings in the spring and publish any reports in a timely manner, though many fear this will not happen until the next election.Todayaposs draft Terms of Reference do not name Boris Johnson or promise to look at the inidual behaviour of the Prime Minister. That could come as a blow to bereaved families after ex-aide Dominic Cummings accused him of a litany of failings.But they do vow to look at how prepared the government was and how decisions were made, communicated and implemented, including in the disastrous month before lockdown was imposed on  March . While the inquiry will not investigate inidual cases, it will listen to bereaved families and seek to learn lessons for any future pandemic.Scroll down for the full terms of reference - or have your say in the comments. Importantly it will also have reasonable regard to relevant international comparisons, suggesting the levels of death and disease in the UK could be compared to other European nations. And it will look at the response for shielding people, the poorest forced to rely on sick pay of less than £ a week, and those subject to aposdo not resuscitateapos orders. It will examine the response for care homes, where the virus swept through killing tens of thousands of people despite ministers pledging a aposprotective ringapos. But the inquiry will also look at the merits and problems of lockdown itself, not just the virus response that triggered it.Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “The inquiry is a one off and historic opportunity for the terrible suffering and loss of the past two years to be learned from, to ensure these tragedies are not repeated in the future. “The Government finally publishing the draft Terms of Reference is a huge step forward, and we look forward to feeding into the consultation on them. “Sadly, today’s announcement comes far too late. We will never know how many lives could have been saved had the Government had a rapid review phase in Summer , as we called for at the time. “Crucially, Boris Johnson must now commit to implementing the chairaposs recommendations for the Terms Of Reference in full. The fact his office is under police investigation for breaching their own rules means thathe attempts to interfere with what the inquiry looks into, it risks ruining its credibility before it’s even begun.” Boris Johnson suggested the terms of reference will changethere are complaints, as there will be a four-week period to consult on them. He said: It is vital that we get its terms of reference right and that people can have their say. To deliver this, Baroness Hallett will now lead a period of public engagement and consultation, which will last for four weeks. This process will inform further refinements to the terms of reference before they are finalised and the inquiry begins its important work. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the findings must be delivered before the next general election.” Here is the full list of whataposs been announced today by the government, in the governmentaposs own words. In relation to central, devolved and local public health decision-making and its consequences:preparedness and resilience how decisions were made, communicated and implemented intergovernmental decision-making the availability and use of data and evidence legislative and regulatory control shielding and the protection of the clinically vulnerable the use of lockdowns and other ‘non-pharmaceutical’ interventions such as social distancing and the use of face coverings testing and contact tracing, and isolation restrictions on attendance at places of education the closure and reopening of the hospitality, retail, sport and leisure sectors, and cultural institutions housing and homelessness prisons and other places of detention the justice system immigration and asylum travel and borders and the safeguarding of public funds and management of financial risk.The response of the health and care sector across the UK, including:preparedness, initial capacity and the ability to increase capacity, and resilience the management of the pandemic in hospitals, including infection prevention and control, triage, critical care capacity, the discharge of patients, the use of ‘Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’decisions, the approach to palliative care, workforce testing, changes to inspections, and the impact on staff and staffing levels the management of the pandemic in care homes and other care settings, including infection prevention and control, the transfer of residents to or from homes, treatment and care of residents, restrictions on visiting, and changes to inspections the procurement and distribution of key equipment and supplies, including PPE and ventilators the development and delivery of therapeutics and vaccines the consequences of the pandemic on provision for non-COVID related conditions and needs and provision for those experiencing long-COVID.The economic response to the pandemic and its impact, including government interventions by way of:support for businesses and jobs, including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, loans schemes, business rates relief and grants additional funding for relevant public services and benefits and sick pay, and support for vulnerable people.Identy the lessons to be learned from the above, thereby to inform the UK’s preparations for future pandemics. In meeting these aims, the inquiry will:listen to the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss as a result of the pandemic. Although the inquiry will not investigate inidual cases of harm or death in detail, listening to these accounts will inform its understanding of the impact of the pandemic and the response, and of the lessons to be learned highlight where lessons identied from preparedness and the response to the pandemic may be applicable to other civil emergencies consider the experiences of and impact on health and care sector workers, and other key workers, during the pandemic consider any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic and the state’s response, including those relating to protected characteristics under the Equality Act  and equality categories under the Northern Ireland Act , as applicable have reasonable regard to relevant international comparisons and produce its reportsand any recommendations in a timely manner.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonHospitalsCare homesNursing homesPublic inquiryPublic servicesPoliticsHomelessnessCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Government had promised to increase teachers pay by % over the next two years and bring them up to £k by September . But the proposed increases for more experienced teachers are lower, with increases of % in  and % in , equating to an average rise of just under % across all teachers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated. Given soaring levels of inflation, the proposals for teacher pay would see a real terms cut of % for more experienced staff between  and . And when taking the decade of Tory cuts to teachers pay the IFS estimates teachers will see a pay cut of % from  to .  For those at the top of the pay scale, equating to around a third of classroom teachers, this is equal to a pay cut from £, to £,. Luke Sibieta, research fellow at the IFS, said: The Governmentaposs proposals for teacher pay in  and  would enable them to deliver on a manesto commitment to raise starting salaries to £,. However, smaller pay rises of -% per year for most other teachers are likely to represent real-terms cuts and would follow on from more than a decade of real-terms pay cuts. There is also a risk that the highly unstable geopolitical and economic situation pushes inflation higher still. While there are clearly signicant pressures and demand on school budgets, schools need to be able to recruit and retain high-quality staff to meet those challenges. An increase in school funding of close to £ billion in  means there is room for a higher pay award within planned school budgets. A higher award than that proposed by the Government may carry fewer risks than a lower one. It comes as millions of workers are set to face a £, pay cut in April when inflation skyrockets due to Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine. MPs were told yesterday the cost of living crisis will prove fatal for some of the poorest families as Brits face soaring energy bills, rising inflation and national insurance hikes. Living standards across the UK will be slashed by around £, per household as Boris Johnson unveiled severe sanctions on the Kremlin. In the wake of this, the Chancellor faces a huge judgement call on whether to borrow or allow households to face the biggest price hike since the s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has claimed.  IFS director Paul Johnson said: Will he do more to protect households from the effects of energy prices which have risen even further in the last two weeks  If he doesnapost then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis. If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances. Prices have already suged by .% in the year to January , due to rising energy, fuel and food prices. Labour has blasted the Tory Government for allowing the cost of living crisis to spiral over the last six months. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: The Conservatives should halt their National Insurance hike in April – and they must look again at Labour’s proposal for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut household energy bills by up to £. But we’ve also got to get out of this Tory high tax, low growth trap that is making our economy less resilient and leaving public services weakened. That means growing our economy – by buying, making and selling more in Britain and through our Climate Investment Pledge, Labour will get us firing on all cylinders. According to forecasts, someone on a median salary of £, is likely to be around £ worse off, thataposs £ more than earlier forecasts. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: Teachers and other educators are already in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis even before the impact of higher inflation.They canapost afford any more pay cuts, but the Government can afford to invest in our public services including education.Cuts to public sector pay damage the private sector too, due to the reduced spending power of public sector workers. Cuts to education cause signicant economic damage, because economic recovery depends on investing in the skills and potential of our young people. Government investment to protect our public services including education is essential, and that means restoring pay cuts instead of inflicting more of them.

The updated UK sanctions list said Mr Abramovich has had a close relationship for decades with Putin, which the football club owner has previously denied.The Russian businessman was named alongside billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska on the list, which imposes assets freezes, travel bans and a prohibition on transactions with UK iniduals and businesses. These elite iniduals have a collective net worth of £ billion, the Foreign Office said in an official announcement. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. Todayaposs decision brings the total number of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by Britain to , with another five already on the list. Sanctions have also been imposed on Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and a number of Belarusian officials  Liz Truss said: Today’s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression.The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame. Boris Johnson said: There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putinaposs vicious assault on Ukraine. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was the right decision but it should not have taken the Government weeks. He said: Too few oligarchs linked to Putinaposs rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK Government. We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the Government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap.Here are the new names added to the sanctions list. Roman Abramovich Roman Abramovich is one of the most high-profile Russian oligarchs in the UK thanks to his ownership of Cha Football Club. Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £. billion and has a multi-million pound property empire in the UK, also has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, the UK Government said. He sold a % stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £. billion in . He recently announced plans to sell the top-flight football club, which he has owned since , after initially saying he was passing stewardship to the clubaposs charitable foundation. Abramovich has denied having strong ties with Putin but the Government said he had had received financial benefits from the Kremlin, including tax breaks for his companies, the buying and selling of shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and contacts in the run up to the  World Cup in Russia.The list shows he has been sanctioned both on the basis of his personal connections to the Kremlin and preferential contracts over the years, but also the role the Evraz steel company plays - the British government believe it is providing steel to the Russian military The football club has now been seized by the UK Government but ministers have issued a licence authorising Cha to continue playing matches. Season ticket holders and those with games already booked can still attend matches, but no new tickets can be sold and the clubaposs merchandise shop will close. Abramovich’s UK property will also be frozen with not even cleaners allowed to enter it. But the asset is still only “frozen” - not actually seized by the UK government. Technically the tycoon’s family - who are not directly targeted with sanctions - could stay in his homes but officials believe it would be practically very dficult. Oleg Deripaska Industrialist Oleg Deripaska, who is Abramovichaposs former business partner, was among those newly added to the sanctions list. The Russian tycoon has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. Deripaska is estimated to be worth £billion, with a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK.  He hit the headlines in  when he hosted Labour grandee Lord Peter Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu. Mr Osborne was accused of trying to solicit a donation for the Tory party from the oligarch - something he denies. The US designated Deripaska in , which is means a personaposs assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them. Igor Sechin Tycoon Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. The UK Government described him as a particularly close and influential ally of Putin and he is understood to be regarded as Putinaposs number two.  He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. The French Government seized a yacht linked to the oligarch last week. Andrey Kostin Andrey Kostin is the chairman of VTB bank, Russiaaposs second largest bank. The bank was designated by the UK last month. The UK put his net worth at an estimated £ million. Kostin was described by the FCDO as a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through the bank.  He has previously accused the West of waging economic war against Russia through sanctions. He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller The chief executive of Russian energy company Gazprom is one of the most important executives supporting the Kremlin. Miller served under Putin in the s when the now-President was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. UK officials believe he has been going along his career trajectory with Putin since the Russian President was was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in s.  Miller has already been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He served alongside Putin in the KGB in Dresden, East Germany, in the s. They have remained closely associated ever since. Tokarev has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Dmitri Lebedev Dmitri Lebedev is the chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya. The UK designated Bank Rossiya, widely considered to be the Kremlin’s private bank, on  February . Lebedev was sanctioned by the US in .

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

The history student first started feeling unwell in August , but she claims doctors told her she had a blockage in her body. The mum from Essex said: I was on the contraceptive pill. I was taking it every day and even through my pregnancy, I was taking it every day. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here I didnapost really have any symptoms. I was still having periods every month and didnapost have a bump or anything like that. When she first saw a gastroenterologist in October, Ellie claims she had blood tests which didnapost detect any hormones that indicated she was expecting. She recalled: The only reason I started going to the doctors was because I had stomach pain, was really uncomfortable and felt like I was putting on weight. I did a pregnancy test at home and thought aposoh, itaposs negative, it canapost be thatapos and had six doctors say that I wasnapost pregnant.  I went to the doctors and they looked me over, sent me for some blood tests and gave me a pregnancy test while I was there, and it came back negative. They thought it was something to do with my digestive system so I was sent to specialists. All of the easy stuff was being ruled out by tests and they thought it was quite serious and that I basically had a blockage somewhere. She even claims she had an ultrasound scan on  December which didnapost detect anything in her womb - but the following day she realised that wasnapost the case. After going out for dinner to celebrate her grandmotheraposs birthday, Ellie went to bed but woke up hours later with excruciating stomach and back pain.  After throwing up for the next four hours, Ellieaposs mum called an ambulance at am and she was rushed to AE. Ellie recalled: I went for a wee and it felt like all of my lower stomach muscles were just pulling and I thought aposthereaposs something there, thereaposs something going on thataposs not quite rightapos. While on the toilet, Ellie screamed out to the nurse who rushed in to examine her. I said the pain was really bad and worse than it ever had been and they basically pushed me onto my side and her head was born, and that was the first time I knew that I was one, pregnant, and two, in labour, she recalled. Her head came out and the doctors recoiled back from the bed and said aposwe need to get a midweapos and pulled the panic button. At that point I had another pain and she was delivered on the bed behind me.  I didnapost quite believe it. I thought I was hallucinating at that point as well because of the pain and then I had this bundle put next to me and cuddled up with me, and there was a little baby face. And that was the first time I kind of fully believed that this was happening to me. Ellieaposs daughter Alicia was born at .am on  December  weighing lbs oz. Ellie claims she had been taking the contraceptive pill for six years and was advised by doctors that this meant that it wasnapost as effective as it should have been. She was also told it was regulating her hormones, which is why her pregnancy wasnapost detected via tests. Ellie believes her pregnancy wasnapost spotted on the ultrasound because Aliciaaposs back was against her spine, which also explains the excruciating back pain she experienced during labour.  After Ellieaposs friends and family got over the shock, they rushed to her aid to provide the new mum with nappies and baby equipment - seeing as sheaposd not had time to get anything ready for Alicia. Ellie said: Because I was still in that panic mode, my first reaction was aposI canapost be a mum, I canapost do it, please donapost.apos I spent  minutes alone with her and said aposyou know what,my body could have done that, I can do it, itaposs meant to beapos and I just fell in love with her at that point anyway. I rang my friends and they didnapost believe me, so they had to come to the hospital and they all cried. I think I was the only person that didnapost cry, because I was still in a bit of a blur. Now Ellie couldnapost imagine her le without Alicia, who she describes as a whirlwind of energy. She said: Sheaposs an absolute little fighter, she had nothing wrong with her and we joke that she was pickled through the pregnancy.Did you have a surprise miracle baby  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcBut she is incredible, smart and she started walking when she was -months-old. She is just amazing and full of beans. I canapost imagine my le without her now. Itaposs crazy.

Dubbed ‘Deltacron’, the new French-based strain combines both lineages. However, its severity is not yet known.But there is a warning that immunity is waning in the elderly as one scientist added that it is aposthe real thingapos. The World Health Organisation said it is apostracking and discussingapos the iant following research into the strain. There is no clear data yet to show whether Deltacron is more infectious than its predecessors. Health chiefs told The Sun a very small number of cases have been detected in Britain, but more details are to be reported in a briefing on Friday.Aris Katzourakis, professor of evolution and genomics at the University of Oxford, said: “It is one to keep an eye on. This one is legit. Dr Stephen Grfin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “Whilst it doesn’t seem to have taken off as a dominant strain yet, this could be due to a very slow start based upon seeding density - the number of initial cases, he said.“There are multiple scenarios that can play out here in terms of what this means for people that become infected as this combination of viral proteins may behave dferently to either parent. “The French cluster appears to be a validated occurrence where a recombination event has given rise to a virus fit enough to circulate.Last month, the UK Health Security Agency announced it was investigating a iant named “Delta x Omicron Recombinant ”.However, it is not knownthis is linked to the French-based Deltacron.  Hospitalisation in the UK have shown an aposuptickapos in the past fortnight, data shows. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study estimates around , people are catching Covid each day - a  per cent hike in one week. Study co-founder Professor Tim Spector said: “The ‘official’ UK dashboard rate that continues to provide a misleading picture of the pandemic in the UK and should be scrapped. “The major increase in new cases across the country and in the elderly is a worry, especially as we now see an uptick in hospitalisations for the first time. “This increase was predicted when all restrictions were lted. “We are likely to continue to see high infection and prevalence rates of  in  people for the foreseeable future.” Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UKHSA, said: “The increasing presence of the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see Covid circulating at high levels.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of OxfordCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In it, they opened up about many members of the Firm - with Harry accusing his dad Prince Charles of cutting him off financially and not taking his calls. Even after the explosive chat, he appeared on the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting and talked about total neglect on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See. Later reports claimed that relations between the pair were at rock bottom - but recently there have been signs that Harry, Meghan and Charles could be ready to bury the hatchet. Here we take a look at them... Full of praise  One of the first signs that Harry and Charlesapos relationship could be improving was just a few days into . Charles wrote an essay for Newsweek, where he issued a call for urgent action to save the environment.In the piece, he praised both Prince William and Harry for their work in raising awareness of the issue. He spoke about how he was proud of both of his sons for having recognised the threat of climate change. He said: Most recently, my elder son, William, launched the prestigious Earthshot Prize to incentivise change and help repair our planet over the next ten years by identying and investing in the technologies that can make a dference. And my younger son, Harry, has passionately highlighted the impact of climate change, especially in relation to Africa, and committed his charity to being net-zero.

Shortly after the Newsweek essay was released, the Mirror revealed that Charles had held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with Harry. Sources close to Charles said that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship. One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Regular contact And it seems these video calls might not be a one-off for Harry and Charles and itaposs been suggested they talk regularly.Thataposs because, writing in the , royal expert Camilla Tominey claims that Prince Charles is thought to be in regular contact with his youngest son.However, she added: Whether Meghan will everto the UK remains to be seen. Olive branch invitation Meanwhile, it has also been reported that Charles offered his son an olive branch by offering him an invitation to stay with him the next time he brings his family to the UK.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood. But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. Meghanaposs photo Meanwhile, another sign came on Tuesday when eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a touching photo of Meghan Markle that has pride of place in Charles and the Duchess of Cornwallaposs home.Camilla welcomed three female rowers, who crossed the Atlantic in record time, to Clarence House - the London home she shares with Charles - to mark International Womenaposs Day. They were joined by former male rower Tim Christian and were pictured chatting with Camilla in a sitting room at the royal residence.  Behind where the guests were sitting, royal fans noticed a side table that was filled with lovely family photos. And one of them included a stunning black-and-white image of Meghan with Charles on her wedding day in . When Meghan married Harry, Charles escorted the bride halfway down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - and the framed photo appears to depict this.

Hospital admissions have also risen sharply, with , people in hospitals with the virus on March  and  requiring a mechanical ventilator.The worrying figures come just weeks before the government plans to scrap free lateral flow tests for most people on April .Are you worried by the rise  Have your say in the comment section Free PCR tests will also not be available to people with symptoms as the government implements its aposLiving with Covidapos plan, introduced on February .

Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency , told Sky News: These data confirm that cases have declined substantially following the peak of the Omicron wave.However, the increasing presence of the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see COVID circulating at high levels.

Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said it was “impossible to make a sensible prediction” about the size of any BA. wave but the situation needed close monitoring.He told the: “The worry is that it’s hard to see anything happening in the next few weeks that will reverse the growth of BA. unless, that is, people decide on their own account to step up precautions.”Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, said the recent rise was foreseeable. “We’ll see a great deal more of this, along the lines of recent resurgent spikes in Scotland and Hong Kong,” he said. “Caseloads were by no means low or under control as we came out of all mitigations and, when you add in waning immunity and the enhanced transmissibility of BA., it looks like we are in for a dficult period, especially for the elderly.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDepartment of HealthGrant ShappsHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sanctions have been imposed on a government level while companies have also inidually decided to stop their trade with Russian firms.It is thought that the boycott of Russian goods along with other economic sanctions could force Vladimir Putin into ending the invasion. Many major supermarkets have stopped selling Russian products, with some taking more signicant action than others, reported the Liverpool Echo. Tesco said it will not be removing any products from its shelves, but it will not place any further orders with Russian suppliers.A spokesperson for Tesco reportedly stated that it would no longer be “buying products from businesses that are wholly Russian-owned”. A statement from the supermarket read: “We are supporting humanitarian relief efforts through our partnerships with the Red Cross, food banks and other relief organisations to help those affected in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.” Here are all the products that have been removed from supermarkets: AsdaAsda has confirmed it is removing all products that originate from Russia from its stores and online - around  items in total.Most of these are spirits, though the list also includes fish and some sweets. Asda’s co-owner Mohsin Issa said: “We stand with our customers and colleagues who are shocked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine – and our thoughts are with those people whose lives are affected by this crisis.”On March , Asda and its charity, the Asda Foundation, announced a £m package to support displaced Ukrainian families in Europe and the UK. Aldi The budget-friendly retailer has said it will no longer sell Russian vodka.At the start of the month, Aldi announced that they would be making a donation to the Red Cross Ukraine Crisis Appeal.They said in a statement: We stand together with Aldi colleagues across the world and will be making a donation to the Red Cross Ukraine Crisis Appeal.

We have reviewed our product range and have decided to remove from sale all products that are % sourced from Russia. The supermarket giant has also recently renamed its Chicken Kiev to Kyiv - the Ukrainian capital - to stand with Ukraine. Customers should see the change in packaging over the next few weeks.  Co-op, Morrisons and Waitrose The Co-op, Morrisons and Waitrose have also removed Russian vodka from their shelves. A spokesperson for the Co-op said the decision to remove the sale of Russian-made vodka was a sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine. A spokesman for Morrisons, meanwhile, said: “We have taken action on our vodka lines today including delisting Russian Standard.” Waitrose and John Lewis said earlier this month they would no longer sell products made in Russia, starting with Russian vodka and one line of pizza oven pellets.

Others who stayed at The Airport Hotel in Manchester claim there was a huge stench of cigarette smoke and alleged their bedding had not been changed for three weeks.The budget hotel has faced complaints from multiple guests online, and some have claimed that they found suspicious stains on a duvet and dirt throughout their bedroom, ManchesterEveningNews reports. The accommodation, which is rated two out of five bubbles on TripAdvisor, is owned by Britannia Hotels - which has recently been voted the worst hotel chain in the UK for the ninth year running.In recent weeks, a series of terrible reviews have been shared on the travel site, and guests at the Northenden hotel branch branded it diabolical and filthy. One guest, named Emma, claimed that she had been staying in the hotel after fleeing domestic abuse. Rating the hotel just one star, she wrote: Cleaning staff haven’t changed my bedding in THREE WEEKS actually think I’m going to be sick from how they’ve treated me. Another, named Laura alleged she had an awful experience where she found herself sinking right through the mattress through to the other side. Laura claimed that after she changed rooms three times she ended up in one with stained bedding. She said: Given room  and wanted a little sleep. Pulled back the duvet and the bed springs were coming through the mattress so we were given another room on the same floor. I sat on the bed and sunk through it! It jolted my back really badly. I took a picture of the mattress to show the manager.  Was given a third room and the manager came with us and again a mattress with the springs sowingthrough. He admitted that all the mattresses in the hotel were in the same sorry state. So I asked for spare duvets to sleep on to try to create padding from springs. One of the spare duvets had blood on it! I then got the spare pillows down and they had hairs all over them from a previous guest. Also there were chocolate buttons under my bed and a chupa cup wrapper under my friendaposs bed. Certainly not cleaned. Putting hygiene sticker on the door make no dferenceyou do not vacuum the floor! She also claims that she woke up in the morning with terrible back pain and was forced to lie on the dirty floor to try and relieve it. Another guest, Catherine B, said it was the worst hotel she has ever stayed in. She said: Our allocated room was an unprepared room that had not been cleaned, it had dirty sheets on the bed that had clearly been slept in and mud on the carpet. This was rectied, but our subsequent room was dreadful. The mattress had springs you could feel through the sheets, and the edge of the mattress had collapsed. The whole hotel is worn out and everything needs replacing. The lts smell of stale cigarette smoke. The whole place has an unpleasant odour, possibly due to the smoking rooms, and cigarette smoke infiltrating the whole building. Avoid at all costs. Another user, Aidan, included pictures of a stained door handle and a stain on the floor, saying: Honestly, DO NOT STAY HERE! Rooms are filthy, unfit for purpose and theyaposre just an absolute joke all around. The lts look like they haven’t been replaced since the s.

Despite this, not everyone has had a bad experience at the Airport Hotel, with one recent guest saying it was absolutely fine. One read: Our room was fine. Clean, warm and quite spacious actually but the bed was a bit old and uncomfortable. Other than that itaposs dficult for us to really find fault. We had a burger and chips from the bar which was perfectly edible and we only stayed in the room for just over  hours. Itaposs not The Ritz and the room decor was a bit tired but for our purposes, the Britannia was absolutely fine. Another recent review added: Perfect for our needs for an early flight from Manchester airport! The room is cleana little basic but plenty space for our family!

Kate had her sister Pippa as her maid of honour while Prince William chose his younger brother Prince Harry as his best man.Harry kept up best man tradition by giving a speech at the wedding reception - and according to many of the guests it was the highlight of the big day, evenhe did make Kate cry. Royal author Katie Nicholl gave an insight into the tear-jerking speech in her biography Harry: Le, Loss, and Love.  She said: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. The speech was peppered with Harryaposs classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: aposWilliam didnapost have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kateapos. Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate aposBabykinsapos, to much laughter from the guests.

When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. Kate and brother-in-law Harry previously had a jovial relationship - he even famously described Kate as the sister he never had and the pair were often seen giggling or sharing a joke at royal events.But according to royal expert Duncan Larcombe, Harry and Kateaposs sibling-like relationship is now long in the past.  It comes amid a growing feud between William and Harry and the fact that Harry and we Meghan Markle decided to quit as royals and leave the UK for Calornia. And speaking earlier this year as Kate approached her th birthday, Duncan told OK! : Kate was, as Harry said, the sister he never had and clearly that is not the case anymore.There was a time when Harry would have been instrumental in any celebrations or any fun that the couple were having, but those days are long in the past.

The Money Saving Expert founder warned about forthcoming price rises which will impact Brits in the coming months.Martin revealed that the price of stamps and prescriptions will rise from April , the Manchester Evening News reports.First class stamps are going up by p to p, and nd class stamps will now cost p, up by p. Consumer expert Martin issued a useful tip to adults in the UK to help them save money ahead of Christmas. The key rule here is to stock up now on these class stamps i.e those that say first or second. In the past when prices went up Iaposd always say you could use them indefinitely but you can only use these until January , , Martin said.  So buy [these] Christmasapos stamps nowyou can do so. Ordinary stamps are set to be replaced by bar coded stamps from February . Martin also advised that you could still buy the existing stamps now, and then swap them in for the new ones via a free scheme that is going to come later in the year. Butyou are going to use stamps in the future, you may as well buy them in now whilst they are cheap, he added. His advice comes as family finances face being stretched as Ofgemaposs price cap will rise for  million homeowners, with the average household bill increasing by around £ per year.Earlier this week Martin issued a new video with three things everyone must do before prices rise on April . This included checkingyou can stockpile energy now to beat the price hike, taking a meter reading nowyou pay by direct debit and checking how you can claim a £ council tax rebate from April. Keep an eye out for a letter from the council because each council will tell you its claim system and you need to watch for that,” said Martin. If youaposre not eligible for the £, say, because youaposre in a higher band, then there is a discretionary £ million fund being set-up to help those who are struggling. “It will be up to each council to decide how it distributes it, but be ready to claim that.

The collision, which involved a motorbike and a Nissan, happened in Liverpool on Wednesday at about .pm.Afterwards, the motorbike was reportedly left in the middle of the road in flames after the rider ran off from the scene, LiverpoolEcho reports. Jake Carter, from Childwall, has shared Ring doorbell footage and a CCTV clip of what happened on his TikTok page after the crash happened outside his home. The -year-old claims the Silver Nissan, which was hit by the scrambler bike, belonged to a mechanic who was coming to his home to look at a car.  He claims the mechanic indicated and drove towards his house and onto his drive. However, he claims that as the driver turned into the driveway, two scrambler bikes flew up the road and smacked into the back of the Nissan. Ring doorbell footage shows one of the riders jumping on his wall and screaming: You nearly killed me lad. What were you doing   In footage shared with the ECHO, a masked person wearing a balaclava can then be seen jumping onto the bonnet of a Range Rover on the drive and smashing it with his foot. The Range Rover was not involved in the crash. Speaking over the TikTok video, which shows the CCTV footage, Jake Carter said: Three lads wearing balaclavas were extremely confrontational and aggressive to the gentleman.  The mechanic is an older guy who is lovely and he was extremely shook up [sic] by this situation. But then one of the three musketeers decides to do a little bit of a jigg on the wall before jumping onto my dadaposs car and basically kicked the windscreen in. Spiderman then jumps back on the wall before fleeing the scene on another scrambler. Jakeaposs video of the crash and the thug later vandalising his dadaposs car has been viewed on TikTok more than , times.  It was shared on his page @Jakecartermusic with the caption: Help us find who these scumbags are, someone must know something  They’re missing a scrambler now! Please share. In the video, Jake points to the ECHO article about the motorbike being left abandoned in the middle of the road. He then says: So this happened outside our house in Liverpool today and one lovely boy decided to do some bodywork to my dadaposs Jeep. Police confirmed they are aware of the incident and are appealing for information. No one was injured in the incident but both the Nissan and Range Rover were damaged.A spokesperson for Mersyside police said: We are appealing for information following a report a motorbike was on fire in Childwall this afternoon .At around .pm emergency services were called to a report that a motorbike was on fire in the middle of the road on Childwall Park Avenue, near to the Black Woods.

The terraced home in Christchurch, Dorset was listed on the market on Tuesday March . The large living room takes up over half of the downstairs and its main feature is a detailed ceiling painting that depicts angels flying and sitting on clouds. The depiction is bordered with round gold and blue trim with ious patterns.  A bust of a woman stands tall at the back of the room, while gold trimmed patterned chairs and couches are positioned next to the light blue walls. There is a marble coffee table that sits on an old fashioned royal-looking carpet whilst a large gold rimmed mirror hangs on the back wall. Breaking the Roman theme, there is a flat screen TV hung from the wall and a guitar amplier resting on one of the chairs.  Leaving the lavish room, the rest of the house appears to be far more common. The kitchen is of a good size and has a double glass door that leads to the garden. Two of the three bedrooms are of good size and can comfortably accommodate double beds, while the third room could only fit a single bed.  The only bathroom in the property is situated upstairs and has a large bath and a separate shower. In their listing on Rightmove, Goadsby, who are managing the property wrote: A spacious terraced home situated in a popular area being just yards from Two Riversmeet Leisure Centre with its golf course. Christchurch town centre is also easily accessible.  There is a covered entrance porch which has a storage cupboard, a door leads through to the lounge. The lounge is a good size with a front aspect window. A door leads through to the kitchen breakfast room which has ample space for a dining table whilst also having a good range of wall and floor cupboards with working surfaces over... There are  doubles, both having fitted cupboards and Bedroom  is currently used as an office.  The bathroom benefits from a corner bath with separate shower cubicle, pedestal wash hand basin and low level w.c. One social media user saw the unique living room and decided to share it on Reddit: For just £k you can enjoy the wonders of the Sistine Chapel from the comfort of your own living room. The post has over  likes and has been commented on over a dozen times.Reddit users found the living room amusing.@Grumpyandproud said: I was not prepared for that living room. @Keiepse wrote: aposThe lounge is a good size with a front aspect window.aposAmazing that the agent couldnapost think of anything  for the description. @Leftpillz commented: Itaposs a pretty appropriate design given the cityaposs name, Christchurch. @Nicowltan replied: That living room is insane, but Iaposm a big fan of the dog at the back door.@busyphil added: Wow.

Two years on, we have seen communities come together, neighbours look out for one other and groups form across the UKCharles Burrell Centre manager Nik Chapman, outside the centre in Thetford Image: MATTHEW USHERByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Mar |comments At the peak of the pandemic, on the Henley Green estate in Coventry, residents got used to the sight of two top-of-the-range Jaguars delivering food.The local community centre had turned its ‘Grub Hub service’ into a delivery service for isolating residents. As it grew from  members to supporting , people, they had asked local business for support. “Jaguar Land Rover let us use two of their vehicles,” says Dianne Williams, , CEO of the Moat House Trust. “We went out delivering meals in these two white jags. It was brilliant.”We are days away now from the second anniversary of lockdown. Two years on, we have seen communities come together, neighbours look out for one other and groups form across the UK. Never mind that – to use words of one campaigning organisation – we were led by donkeys. The British public were lions – acting as a pride. This week, the Mirror has been celebrating working class solidarity and community spirit after revisiting our  Wigan Pier Project journey. Now, we are paying tribute to those who stepped up during the pandemic. From the Knowle West Alliance who fed people in Bristol, to an advice delivery service in Berwick-on-Tweed, to the Levy Corona Helpers in Manchester’s Levenshulme and Centre in Grimsby, this was a national effort carried out at grassroots level. Hyper-local micro-miracles that have changed the face of Britain. Over , mutual aid groups – modelled on systems of support used by black radicals in America – provided solidarity, not charity, supported by a staggering three million volunteers. Existing community projects transformed their provision. Trade unions turned out volunteers, as well as getting workers furloughed and preventing redundancies.  The Mirror teamed up with the Red Cross for a Kindness Will Keep Us Together campaign and more than , signed up. From driving people to hospital appointments to delivering essential medicines, more than , acts of kindness were carried out across the country in just the first four months of lockdown.More than , people signed up to the NHS volunteer scheme. In the first three weeks of lockdown, , people signed up to become community volunteers. More than , people donated their time in  to support the vaccine rollout.Groups formed to help with food shopping and food parcels, collecting prescriptions and providing dog walking. They helped tackle loneliness, were a source of trustworthy Covid information, set up community gardens, and much more. But most importantly, in dark times, every act of kindness was a beacon of hope. The Charles Burrell Centre in Thetford, Norfolk, became a hub for mutual aid that has never ended. “We had a lady in this week enquiring about eligibility for fuel voucher,” Nik Chapman, CEO of The Charles Burrell Centre in Thetford, says. “In the last eight weeks, she only switched her heating on for Christmas Day and had been eating all food cold. She has been making extreme decisions to stay out of debt.”  The Centre provides a supermarket, a community fridge, a hygiene and a fuel bank – services accessed by around , people. “It’s not just about any food,” Nik says. “We need to combat diabetes, obesity and rickets. Le expectancy in this part of Thetford is  to  years less than the more affluent parts. Part of that is nutrition.” He adds: “% of the people who come are employed – a lot work at local supermarkets but they can’t afford to shop there.” Some  miles away in London, the Manor House Development Trust realised many families were unable to home school because they had no internet access. “People would usually come to our spaces to use the wi, but during the pandemic we couldn’t do that,” CEO Simon Donovan, , says. So, they crowdfunded to get residents old and young online. They delivered art packs to kelp kids learning and connected knitters and sewers who got to work making PPE. More than  volunteers gave out , pre-cooked meals to local residents – , kilos of food. Two years on, some Mutual Aid groups have already pivoted to help refugees from Afghanistan, and now Ukraine – putting our government to shame. Meanwhile, the crisis after the pandemic is only just beginning. Vulnerable families face rocketing bills. Many are far worse off than when they were furloughed, while others have lost the £ pandemic uplt to Universal Credit.This incredible network of local groups stands poised to help – but it faces its own challenges, from volunteer burn out to a lack of footfall in charity shops and cafes. Locality – which supports local community organisations – will publish a new report next week that will argue government should put communities in charge of its levelling up funding – including the Community Ownership Fund and UK Shared Prosperity Fund. “Two years ago, an amazing thing happened,” Tony Armstrong, chief exec of Locality, says. “At our hour of need, we looked to each other for help and rediscovered the awesome power of community. Now government, funders and other decision-makers must put their faith in these organisations and give them the powers and resources to get on with the job. There can be no levelling up without powering up community organisations everywhere.”  Done properly, what happened during the pandemic can be a blueprint for Levelling Up. Instead of reinventing the wheel with top-down, eye-catching schemes, the government should strengthen existing community-led projects. “I think we all know it is going to get worse,” Nik Chapman says. “The cost of pretty much everything is rocketing. Undoubtedly the tragedy in Ukraine will have an impact. It’s a crisis. But at least we can be there to say, ‘it’s not going to be alright, but at least you’re not alone’.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSRed CrossHospitalsChristmas shoppingSupermarketsCoronavirusDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is a blustery outlook for the weekend with a mixed bag before warm weather pushes north. BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker said: The last couple of days the weather really has been quite good, beautul sunny skies for some of us across eastern parts of the UK but things are probably going to turn now. The cloud you can see on the satellite image is a weather front and it’s approaching. It means rain, and really that’s how it is going to be over the next few days.” Looking at Friday he said that there will be heavy rain sweeping in and winds will start to strengthen during the day but it will remain mild. Mr Schafernaker continued: “Now Saturday we see another area of low pressure with new fronts approaching us and this again spells heavy rain initially for western parts of the UK. In the South West as this low pressure increases you can see strong winds blowing around and we could be talking about gusts of mph, maybe even mph around the Isle of Scilly and the top of Cornwall, so really very blustery and even stormy for a time.  Next week we are expecting the temperatures to rise even as high as C or C in south west parts of the UK. Fellow BBC weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas agreed: Moving forward to the start of the new working week, heading on into Monday and it looks like eventually we will lose that low pressure to the north of the UK and we will be seeing a bit of quieter spell of weather for Monday, so less windy for most of us. Still a little bit windy and showery across Scotland first thing and we could see a few spells of light rain across parts of England and Wales but it looks like that should fizzle out during the day and temperatures should [be] C or C, double figures further north.  “But the milder weather is on the way it’s moving its way in from the south moving into Tuesday.” She continued: Tuesday potentially bringing a little bit of rain in the south and the east at first that looks like it will fade away leaving a predominantly dry day with some sunshine, less breezy … best of the sunshine further south and east with temperatures up to about C.” UK forecast for the next  days Windy today with rain moving northeastwards followed by showers. Today: Early cloud and patchy rain in the north and east clearing to sunny spells for a time before cloud and rain . In the south and west, early rain, heavy at times, followed by sunny spells and showers later. Windy. Tonight: Often rather cloudy with showers or longer spells of rain, heaviest and most frequent showers probably over southern, western and central parts during the early hours. Becoming less windy. Saturday: Sunny spells and showers for many, though showers will tend to ease from the south later. Dull, wet and windy weather developing in the west and southwest during the afternoon. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Unsettled on Sunday with showers or rain, wettest and windiest in the northwest, some brighter spells too. Drier for most on Monday and Tuesday, though rain in the northwest.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Using side-by-side pics, Hayley - who goes by the username @ hayleymadiganfitness - showed the dference between an Insta Pool Pose Vs What I see in the bathroom mirror, showing a posed pic next to what her bum looks like in reality.In a powerful caption, Hayley explained: Dferent poses, dferent camera angles, dferent posture, dferent lighting can all make a huge dference to how a body is perceived and more specically how you see your own body! You will see your body in all types of angles and poses. You will see your body relaxed and unposed. You will see yourself in many ways so do not let your eyes deceive you by telling you to feel negative towards your own body.  She continued: You have the power to change your mindset, to look at your own body in a kinder manner. To be kinder to yourself and to your mental health. To be kinder to your body, because it is your home and you only have one so treat it with the best kindness you can offer! We often pick holes in our bodies continuously but when you realise that no one worth having in your le wouldn’t ever pick those same holes about you is an important thing to remember. The people that care and love you do not see you the same way, all they see is the happiness, the love, and the sparkle that you bring to them and the world.

Many people have been greatly touched by Hayleyaposs wise words, which are so very important in an age where le filtered through a social media lens can seriously impact the way we view our bodies.One person thanked Hayley for bringing some honesty to Instagram, really admire you for this, while another described her honesty as inspiring.A third person remarked that they wished such pics were shown in high schools, adding: I speak for myself around that age, I only saw the ‘perfect’ Instagram bodies.

But it seems one man on Reddit didnapost get the memo, as he admitted he only recently found out about the special prize-winning eggs - just hours after polishing off a half white, half milk chocolate Creme Egg.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The student, who posted his story anonymously, confessed he had no idea that the egg was special until he saw an advert for the promotion just a few hours later when he had already eaten the chocolate treat and thrown the foil wrapper in a public bin.He said: I am an international student studying in the UK, and so I don’t really keep up with the ads here. A few months ago, Cadbury released  prize-winning eggs across the country with the chance of winning a range of cash prizes including £, .Long story short, I was scrolling through Instagram today and saw the prize-winning egg that looked identical to the one I ate a couple of hours ago. It then dawned on me. I potentially ate £,. The manaposs blunder has left him facing utter defeat as he comes to terms with the potential jackpot he missed out on, as he added: I don’t actually know what  to say other than utter defeat. I think I have officially hit the lowest point in the short  years of my le. While finding one of the rare Creme Eggs is a dficult task in itself, the chances of actually bagging £, are very slim - as only six of the  winning eggs are actually worth the top prize. The six eggs were hidden in an Asda, Co-op, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and an independent retailer, while a further three eggs worth £, on sale in a Waitrose, One Stop and a Booker shop.  Four eggs worth £, are being sold across Iceland and Booths stores, and there are  eggs with prizes of £, while the rest are scattered throughout participating retailers and are worth £ each. Commenters on the Reddit post were sympathetic to the manaposs plight, but many of them suggested he may be able to salvage his prizehe kept hold of his wrapper. One person claimed: To claim, you simply call a number that’s printed on the tin foil wrapping of the winning egg. While another added: Thataposs irrelevant. Evenyou ate the egg, the code you need is on the wrapper, you donapost need the egg itself. So you enjoyed the chocolate, get the packaging out of the bin and collect your winnings! Unfortunately for the student, he had been eating his egg while out and about - so threw the foil wrapper into a public bin and was unable to retrieve it. However, terms and conditions for the Cadbury Creme Egg hunt state that a picture of you not eating your winning egg may be required via email to prove that youaposre the rightful owner of the winning egg. Prizes must be claimed by June ,  and you’ll have to call a number that is printed on the tin foil wrapping of your winning egg to register your win. Andyou really canapost resist the urge to scoff your winning egg, Cadbury has teamed up with sustainable fashion brand Rua Carlota to create a line of clothing that makes it impossible to actually eat the chocolate treats. The line includes a top, balaclava, and gloves, and will be available for one day only on Friday  March at am, via the Rua Carlota website.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cadbury Ltd.ChocolateFood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But one man on Reddit has been having a particularly tricky time after his Tinder date completely stood him up and refused to meet with him, as she claimed he was too fat. The -year-old man shared his story anonymously and claimed he was due to meet up with a woman heaposd met online, but when she saw him from afar she decided he wasnapost her cup of tea - and bolted from the date.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In screenshots of their texts posted in the Tinder forum on Reddit, the woman said: I just saw you from afar and Iaposm sorry I canapost meet you. I donapost like guys who are too fat, Iaposm not attracted to them. Iaposm sorry so itaposs better for me to go back home than to pretend I like you. Good luck with our upcoming dates on Tinder. The man was understandably baffled by the womanaposs message, especially as he pointed out there are pictures of him on Tinder that show his full body - including one of him shirtless. But she pressed on, stating: I thought you were less fat. If that wasnapost enough, the woman also took aim at the manaposs age, claiming there was no way he could be  and insisting he looked closer to .  She said: Itaposs better that way than pretending I like you. And you donapost look , you look like youaposre much older. You look like youaposre , maybe I know because you havenapost found a girlfriend yet. Take care of yourself more. When the woman doubled down even further and told the man to go to the gym some time, the man decided heaposd finally had enough and snapped back. He told her: Iaposm the one dodging a bullet here. And in the title of his Reddit post, he explained: My first tinder experience in a long time. I’m not the smallest weighing in at kgs and ’”. I don’t know how she couldn’t tell I’m the size I am considering I have my gut out on my tinder profile and my Instagram isn’t making me look skinny either.Commenters on the post were firmly on the manaposs side, as many of them took the time to make sure he knew to ignore her shallow comments. One said: You looked great in those pictures bro. She’s too immature for you and apparently extremely shallow. As another added: You look great and you deserve worlds better. I want to personally thank her for not wasting your time. While others were left suspicious of the woman, as they thought she could be a catfish who is making up excuses not to meet with him so she doesnapost expose her true identity. Someone said: I don’t know why but I just have this feeling you were being catfished. It just seems like a ton of projection. But in any case, that was really hurtful and I’m sorry you went through that experience. That is a truly unhappy person to speak to someone that way.

A young woman has shared how she was left disturbed during a flight after the man seated next to her began acting inappropriately, making her feel so uncomfortable that she claims she cried for ten minutes.During a recent flight, where there were only two seats per row on the plane, a model and actress named Melanie found herself sat in the window seat, with an old guy - who she didnapost know - beside her in the aisle seat.According to Melanie, the man proceeded to use both armrests, leaving her without an armrest and squished up against the window.

At this point, Melanie says she was already crying and freaking out, explaining to her followers that she has been sexually assaulted in the past, a factor that only added to her panic about the situation. After Melanie told the flight attendants what was going on, they kindly went back to get her stuff from her seat for her, as she was too scared toto the row where the man was sitting. They get my stuff from my seat and they move me to first class, and for the whole flight I was crying and trying to calm down and move on, she explains.

The comment read: No negativity here, but your tattoo on your forehead reminds me of beautul bosoms.And Zahja, who posts on TikTok under the username @zahja_, said: Oh my f***ing god. Lovely!The woman could then be seen bursting into a fit of laughter, and in the caption of the video, she agreed with the commenter about their observation.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

The -year-old, who lives out in Otago on New Zealandaposs South Island, lives an extraordinary le which involves performing dentistry on himself and not collecting any benefit to survive. There was no particular animosity or argument in the family that broke them apart - but the separation came after the death of Little Johnaposs brother which hit everyone very hard. Little John was battling addictions and watched the collapse of his relationship - and thataposs when he moved out to live in the cave. And he hasnapost moved for the last  years. After publication Stuff shared Little Johnaposs story, his family, including his sister based in Australia, got in touch saying they were so grateful for the words about him.Little Johnaposs sister said: It feels like a weight has been lted, no longer fearing the worst and wondering where he was. It also caused his father, who Stuff agreed not to name and who is based in Dunedin, New Zealand, to contact a foodbank to try to track him down. Michelle Kerr, from the Mosgiel Community Foodbank, told  News it was a huge step for him. Little John explained that he knew his fatheraposs address but hadnapost visited him since he moved to the South.  But on Wednesdaythe father and son were finally reunited after  years apart. Little Johnaposs dad said it was a wonderful experience. The pair enjoyed a meal and spent quality time together - Little John even spoke to his sister in Australia. Little John even found out his mother had died in . The father and son decided they plan to see each other again in the future.  Living several kilometers away from the closest human structure, Little John said itaposs there that he found peace with God and became close with his fellow Christians.Little John himself said the Stuff article had helped him too as he has been able to form bonds with local residents. Where previously they were wary of picking him up, he can now hitchhike. And a few weeks ago Little John said he heard people calling his name who had obviously gone looking for him. Struggling to find his cave at first, they began calling his name, to which he replied Gaposday. Little John said he had had some offers from hopeful aposcave womenapos, but not as many as he wanted. He particularly likes the cold months in the Otago caves and plans to spend winter there. Explaining why he lives in the cave he said for me itaposs natural, and natural is healthy.  He also doesnapost want to claim the unemployment benefit or eventually the pension because he said the money would give him access to his addictions. Little John explained heaposs always had a problem with booze and smokes but now he smokes and drinks much less basically because he canapost afford it. He has given up on Government support, come off the dole and closed his bank account in what he describes as a really big step. Doing odd jobs and using food banks, he gets by on around  a year. Little John added that he lives in a cave because itaposs free but also because nobody bugs him there.

But with state media having backed the Ukrainian invasion the majority of Russians appear to seemingly be in support - and it is Putinaposs control over journalists that has helped him to rule without any signicant opposition. Now, though, on a programme hosted by Vladimir Soloviyev, a staunch supporter of Putin’s regime, guests openly criticised the attack on Ukraine with one saying it was like “Afghanistan but even worse.” The use of Afghanistan as an example is signicant in Russia as it is seen as a military humiliation - with the country having spent  years in the country before withdrawing in . Soloviyev has been pedalling state propaganda even agreeing that the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol this week was “fake news” - claiming the building was now being used by Ukraine troops.He was left fuming, though, by comments on his Thursday night show where they questioned what the Russians were doing in Ukraine.Karen Shakhbnazarov, a filmmaker and political commentator, took a dig at the decision to invade Ukraine on the Russia  channel. “The war in Ukraine paints a frightening picture, it has a very oppressive influence on our society. Ukraine, whichever way you see it, is somewhere with which Russia has thousands of human links, he said, reported the Daily Beast.  The suffering of one group of innocents does not compensate for the suffering of other innocent people... I don’t see the probability of denazication of such an enormous country. We would need to bring in . million soldiers to control all of it. He added: The most important thing in this scenario is to stop our military action. Shakhbnazarov did toe the country’s line that the war was caused by the United States but he said that a “humanitarian disaster” would also see Russia’s allies like China and India distancing themselves.  The host, who is one the Russians to have been sanctioned by the EU and has had an Italian villa seized, was left annoyed by the analysis but other guests were also critical. Semyon Bagdasarov, a Russian Middle East expert, agreed with Shakhbnazarov and said that Russians need to prepare for total isolation. He drew the parallels with Afghanistan saying: Let Ukrainians do this denazication on their own. We can’t do it for them... As for their neutrality, yes, we should squeeze it out of them, and that’s it.  We don’t need to stay there longer than necessary... Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse  There are more people and they’re more advanced in their handling of weapons. We don’t need that. Enough already... As for the sanctions, the world has never seen such massive sanctions.” Other media shows have also given an insight into the war casualties in Ukraine with Russian soldiers dying, which is also going against the official line that the battle is going according to plan.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"walking football kicks off again","story":"Walking football is exactly what is sounds like – a slower version of the beautul game where players walk instead of running.Available in Campbeltown to people aged  and older, it is designed to help people get fit and maintain an active lestyle, no matter their age or fitness.It also supports people getting back into footballthey have given it up due to age or injury.According to Walking Football Scotland, the sport has many benefits which may help improve not only people#s physical health but also their mental health.It also offers social benefits as it allow participants to meet new people, forge new friendships and eliminate feelings of social isolation.Organised by liveArgyll, the Campbeltown sessions will take place weekly from today , from pm to pm, in the new venue of Campbeltown Grammar School#s sports hall.Those interested in taking part can book a place at the reception of Aqualibrium or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"get ready for an autumn puffer","story":"The race is organised by the swimming pool#s operator Mid Argyll Community Enterprises Limited, with the support of sponsors Scottish Sea Farms and Mid Argyll businesses and the co-operation of Scottish Canals, and usually takes place each March.In a Facebook update this month, the organisers said: #We have taken the decision not to run the race at the end of March this year as we will be gearing up at that time to get back in to the pool to get it re-opened after it being under redevelopment for the last year.#Once we have the pool back up and running we will then be able to focus on bringing you a race this autumn.#Please keep your eyes peeled on Facebook and our website for updates later on this spring and summer of our plans for the race.

the Military Medal at the Battle of Longstop Hill. He was commissioned in the field in Africa.Later advancing through Italy, Germany and Austria, he ended his service in an Austrian town called Dolsech, after which his home in Campbeltown is named.During discussions on his war service with Lt Col Donald Ross OBE and Col Robert Steele, it became apparent that he had not been awarded the Territorial Decoration to which he was entitled.The army medals office was approached and it was agreed MajMcMillan should receive this honour and he was awarded the Territorial Medal in the Queen’s New Year’s Honours List.At a ceremony last week, his family joined him, including son James who travelled from Canada to witness the medal presentation at the former RAF airbase at Machrihanish.Major McMillan said: #I am delighted to see some of my oldest friends here and as well as receiving this medal, it has made my day.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOIslay’s Ardbeg Distillery has been bought by Glenmorangie plc for £ million.Allied Domecq plc, which owned Ardbeg Distillery, will receive £ million of the total sum in tranches within the next three years.The sale includes the Ardbeg brand, the distillery and surrounding land as well as the stock profile which will come on stream as Ardbeg -year-old and -year-old stocks mature.It will signicantly strengthen Glenmorangie’s current portfolio of malt whiskies which include Glenmorangie and Glen Moray and will provide excellent potential for new brand development, utilising the company’s proven experience in premium brand management.Commenting on the acquisition, Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of Glenmorangie plc, said: #The company has made signicant progress since the introduction of a new strategy in .#We are particularly confident that our existing portfolio will continue to deliver above average growth and we wish to exploit our marketing capability to achieve a similar success rate with this Islay malt.#An opportunity such as Ardbeg, in a segment of the market which remains under developed, provides us with a rare opportunity.#Glenmorangie is well positioned in the Scotch whisky market, with a strong presence in the malt sector which grew by . per cent in the year to October  in export markets and by  per cent from January to October .FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Lachlan McKinnon, the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist officer, this week reported bumper bookings for the coming season.Talking to a Courier man, Mr McKinnon said that there had been a tremendous boom in the self-catering type of holiday.In fact, the association’s list of cottages, chalets and so on has become exhausted with the result that the months of June, July, August up until the middle of September are fully booked.A total of , enquiries were dealt with in the association’s Campbeltown headquarters by the end of February, an increase of  on last year.Mr McKinnon said he hoped the upward trend in self-catering holidays would continue further and preparations would be made to meet with the demand.It is hoped that the Arran-Kintyre ferry service proposed for this summer will be successful.Mr McKinnon’s plan is to bombard the landing jetty at Claonaig with advertising literature in an attempt to induce motorists south to Campbeltown.He feels strongly that the local authority, hoteliers and businessmen should spend more on advertising nationally in an all-out effort to attract tourism to the burgh.‘Unfortunately the tourist association does not have the money to advertise a specic place.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

The pupils all sat on the floor and the film made it look like they were moving in a line without moving their hands or feet.Jim Parkyn of Aardman Animations also joined in for a session and demonstrated how to make model characters from single pieces of plasticine, rather than adding bits together, as pupils# found these often fell apart.This skill has been used frequently since and some of these creations will be evident in the children#s own short animation films which will be showcased on the large screen at Campbeltown Picture House next week.Mhairi Hendrie from the cinema has facilitated the smooth transitions between the schools and ensured ample space was made available for sessions. This enabled the project to spread out and the children to have more hands-on experiences.Eoin Bruce from Campbeltown Grammar School is another expert who joined pupils and shared many technical know-how tips.There are two showcase events planned for Friday, March , and the schools hope people can go along to Campbeltown Picture House and join them.Glenbarr and Clachan#s films and awards will start at am.

Pupils are being asked to work through the key points of the proposals, then discuss the pros and cons together, before agreeing a unied response on behalf of their school.Argyll and Bute Council says it is working with teachers to make sure young people with additional support needs are included in this process.#This consultation with pupils has already begun to make sure their views are heard and considered, as the change proposals are further developed and refined before being presented to the council#s education change committee,# said a council spokesperson.The WISEAll spokesperson added: #What will young learners learn from this exercise  If they are being asked to engage with an age appropriate version of the materials sent to adults, they will simply see a glossy advert for a new school leadership model.#There will be no evidence for the need for change and no explanation of how the changes will improve the key issues identied falling pupil numbers and dficulties recruiting staff.#They will see no alternatives to the education service proposals.

So for someone to attempt that at high speed against another player who is going at high speed, who is upright trying to tackle him, and execute it in the end but on the way to doing that his forearm touches that player’s face ...  “The fine margin for that, from something which would have been celebrated as a great hand-off, to be sent off from the game and you are not going to play for three weeks, is ridiculous in my view. And World Rugby need to come out with a statement and make a distinction between something which is legal and encouraged in the game, and not put attempted hand-offs in the same criteria as a high tackle or a dangerous ruck clear.“They [the English ] followed the head-contact process, but I think that is wrong in this situation,” he added. “We should be protecting the attacking player in a circumstance like that when he is up against someone trying to tackle him upright.“So, obviously we’re disappointed for Duhan. He’s very upset. But we’ll move on, and Kyle will go and grab his opportunity. But I have real questions about the game and what we’re trying to do here, when a hand-off to the face is allowed and encouraged.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snps-independence-project","story":"The SNP’s current excuse not to inflict a second, unnecessary, isive referendum on Scotland follows similar postponements because of Brexit and Covid. If a project has to be cancelled three times because it would be unwise, foolish and dangerous to proceed then it is reasonable to conclude the project is fundamentally flawed.If Scotland, truly was oppressed by being part of the United Kingdom and there was a genuine appetite by the majority to separate Scotland from family and friends in the rest of the United Kingdom then the SNP would proceed regardless of other factors.It is over for the SNP separation project. The United Kingdom will stay united.Bruce Halliday, Dumfries.NO RIGHT TIME FOR INDYREFRUTH Marris right to say that now is not the time to go for a second independence referendum. I would go further and say that there is no right time in the foreseeable future. The Ukraine crisis, along with pandemic recovery, climate change, Brexit fallout, NHS waiting lists, rampant inflation, ageing population, housing shortages and falling education standards are just some of the myriad problems governments and elected representatives will have to deal with at international, national and local level over the coming years and decades. They will all lead to more demand on council services and fewer financial resources to deal with them. Local council elections may seem trivial in comparison, but whatever your political views we should vote for candidates who are motivated by something other than separatist ideology. Use all your single transferable vote choices to elect people who will concentrate on solutions and not those who would add further distraction, complexity and uncertainty to an already dficult situation.Ms Marr quotes Martin Niemoller’s famous reasoning that bad things happen because “I did not speak out”. The council elections are our next chance to get our voices heard. Mark Openshaw, Aberdeen.FM SHOULD STAY OUT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRSYET again, Scotland’s First Minister simply cannot resist offering her opinion and even advice to Nato over the Ukraine crisis. She completely ignores the fact that she and her Government have no role to play in foreign affairs as this is not a devolved area of responsibility, but no matter, in she es again. Quite why those involved in the decision-making process within Nato would take a blind bit of notice of her “advice” is anyone’s guess, particularly when her “advice” is seriously misguided and potentially disastrous. Does she not believe that Nato would already have introduced a no-fly zone over Ukrainethis was practical  Does she not understand the implications of Nato forces shooting down Russian jets  All this from a First Minister and a party that not long ago wanted to leave Nato, still wants to remove nuclear weapons from Scotland and in effect be defenceless against any Russian aggression but of course then remain a beneficiary under the nuclear defence umbrella provided by Nato. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon might want to concentrate on everything in Scotland that is and has been broken under her watch.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.RUSSIA COULD GO NUCLEARTHE United States has intimated that Poland’s cunning attempt at mission creep around what is in effect a redeployment of its Mig-s to the USAF base at Ramstein in Germany has been, quite rightly, vetoed by the US.It ill behoves the First Minster to add her own to the voices suggesting that the option of a no-fly zone be kept on the table. A no-fly zone is precisely the sort of mission creep that could lead to a limited nuclear exchange. In case those who advise Ms Sturgeon on matters military have not pointed this out, tactical nukes in the Russian arsenal do exist. And as insane as it sounds, “escalate to de-escalate” is part of Russian doctrine.Bill Ramsay, Convener SNP CND, Glasgow.  "},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-subway-inner-outer-circles-stopped","story":"Initially, the Outer circle service was reported to have been suspended at around : am due to a power failure.As of around : am it was confirmed that both the Inner and Outer circle services have now been suspended as workers race to resolve the issue.Apologies all, both Inner and Outer Circles suspended due to power failure.

It’s great just not being rushed off my feet  .“The biggest thing is actually having the time to properly rest, maybe go and get a sports massage, or a bath or just take the time after a session to have a proper stretch off. And that’s all made a massive dference.“I’m loving the whole new lestyle and it’s got me in the best shape possible for this fight. It’s also given me a better balance and given me a social le back too!“They say a happy fighter is a dangerous fighter and I think we’re going to see that on the night.”Sutherland has collected belts in his two previous fights, lting the WBC youth title in the outdoor show at Hamilton last summer before stopping Michele Esposito at the Ballroom in November to win his WBC international silver strap.“The last fight went well although I maybe made it a harder night’s work than it really needed to be,” he admits. “There were some mistakes in there, backing up too much and sitting on the ropes. I got into a bit of a fire-fight, maybe it was the crowd or I just wasn’t switching on from the start.“I knew I had the power to hurt him and the bell saved him in the third and fth rounds. But I kept chipping away and the referee did the right thing by stepping in to stop it.”Signing a contract with boxing streaming channel Fightzone has given the southpaw a bit more structure to his career trajectory. Sutherland already expects to be back out again in June and believes fighting regularly will strengthen his chances of moving quicker into title contention.“I loved fighting at the Ballroom the last time,” he adds. “It was the first time Fightzone had been there and they were comparing it to the famous York Hall in London.“They couldn’t wait to come back up here and I think my next three fights will all be at the same venue. That’s great for me and also for my fans knowing they’re not going to have to travel to watch me in action.“Being able to bring big boxing nights back to Aberdeen has been fantastic. With the backing of Fightzone, my manager Sam Kynoch, my trainers plus my nutritionist I feel that everything is going in the right direction. I’ve got a good team behind me now.“I’ve got a quick turn around for my next fight which is pencilled in for June . It’s good now I’m full-time not to have to wait too long between contests.“I want to keep pushing to get closer to an opportunity for the British and Commonwealth titles before the end of the year, or maybe step up and go for a WBC European title.“I’m quite big for the weight so we’ve got the option of moving up to super-welterweight at some point as well.”The other item on Sutherland’s boxing list is to fight one day at Pittodrie. His beloved Aberdeen aren’t enjoying the best of seasons and the man known as Deadly joked he’d love to go in and sort them out.“I think I’m the only hope the city’s got of winning anything for a while!” he laughs. “There are maybe a few characters in the Dons dressing room who need straightening out. I had hoped Scotty Brown was going to do that but maybe I’ll go in and have a word!“I’m hoping to make it along to a few more games now I’m boxing full-time. Hopefully I can also speak to the folk at Pittodrie to arrange for me to fight there one day as that would be class.”"},{"url":null,"title":"small-ponder-kara-hanlon-make-big-splash","story":"She had, after all, spent most of her junior career training in a .m pool which, in elite swimming terms, is little bigger than a puddle. It is, then, quite a jump from those humble beginnings to being Scotland’s newest national record holder having broken a -year-old mark held by one of this country’s best-ever swimmers. Last month, Hanlon broke the long-standing Scottish m breaststroke record, which had been held by World, European and Commonwealth medallist, Kirsty Balfour.  Such a feat is a far cry from her early days in the pool. Hanlon was born and bred on the western isle of Lewis which, unsurprisingly, did not have any Olympic-sized pools to boast of. So, while many of her peers were honing their skills in top-of-the-range facilities on the mainland, Hanlon was doing what she could in a pool a quarter of the size of a full-scale swimming pool and was forging a path no swimmer from the islands had ever managed before. “The pool was tiny but we made it work. “We did things that seem crazy to me now – things like set up a rope and swim up and round it to make it a m pool,” the -year-old recalls. “We did hardly any distance – I was probably doing k a week compared to -k per week now but I really enjoyed it and that’s when things started to develop and I was doing things no one from the islands had ever done before.  “I remember the first time I ever saw a m pool was the first time I raced in a m pool. It seemed absolutely huge.  “And actually swimming it felt so long – I remember realising I wasn’t even halfway and I couldn’t believe it.” At the age of , Hanlon moved to Edinburgh to study and with Edinburgh University boasting an impressive swim set-up, Hanlon has slowly but surely established herself as the best female breaststroker Scotland has to offer, which was confirmed by her getting her hands on that long sought-after Scottish record just a few weeks ago. “It was great to get the Scottish record – I’d been looking to break that for a long time so to finally do it was really nice and get my name in the record books,” she says. “It was pretty surreal to break Kirsty Balfour’s record – there’s been so many good Scottish breaststrokers since Kirsty so for me to be the one to break it was a really big thing and something I’ll remember for a long time. “And now it’s about building on that time.” Hanlon has a big few weeks ahead of her. Starting today, she will compete at the star-studded Edinburgh International, with some of Britain’s very best talent on show such as Olympic champions Adam Peaty, Duncan Scot, Kathleen Dawson and James Guy also in action. For Hanlon, who will be racing on her home turf at the Commonwealth Pool, this weekend is the perfect aperit to the British Championships in four weeks’ time, which will double as the trials for this summer’s World and European Championships, as well as the Commonwealth Games. Having missed out on qualication for the  Commonwealth Games by a mere . of a second, Hanlon is determined to ensure there is no repeat over the coming weeks. “The Edinburgh International is always a good meet and I’m really excited to get going,” she says. “For me, this is pretty much a dry run for the British Champs – everyone I’ll be racing at Trials will be in Edinburgh so that’s great and it’s always good to see where everyone is. “Getting onto GB teams is definitely something I’m striving towards.  “My big goal is to qualy for the Commonwealth Games at the trials and then anything on top of that will be a bonus.” Despite the odds being stacked against her due to her early lack of access to top class facilities, Hanlon’s talent has prevailed which, she admits, was something she did, at times at least, have doubts about. And as the Commonwealth Games draw closer, Hanlon admits she has far loftier aspirations than merely making it onto Team Scotland, with the possibility of becoming the first swimmer from the western isles to win Commonwealth silverware crossing her mind. “When you’re young, you always dream about what you could do but when you go through le, there’s always ups and downs so at times, I did doubt it was possible to get to this point. So to now be here is pretty nice,” she says. “This first goal is to qualy for the Commonwealth Games but then the second is to swim as fast as I can when I get there and hopefully be in contention for a medal.  “That’s a really exciting position to be in.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

This tricky operation was months in the planning to ensure every little detail had been thought of and that we got it right.“As a result of everyone’s hard work and the meticulous planning and safeguarding that went into this operation, we’re absolutely delighted that the nine vehicles have been successfully recovered.“Our attention now turns to getting things in the park back to normal for everyone. We’re refilling the reservoir to its original level, in a controlled manner, and we’re continuing to test water quality to ensure there are no issues.“Mother Nature will take its course and the people of Paisley can once again enjoy this space in a safe manner.”In the run-up to removal day, the water level of the reservoir was gradually lowered daily to bring it to a workable level that would help mitigate for any possible environmental impact. Rigorous testing and monitoring of the water was carried out on a regular basis.Additional mitigation measures were put in place to help avoid any impact on the local water environment. A fish rescue was carried out by Ayrshire Rivers Trust and booms were positioned to help soak up any potential contaminants.Once the reservoir was at a safe level, ers entered the boggy basin to pre-sling the cars in preparation for them being winched from the mud and silt by a recovery truck.From beginning to end, it took just one day for the nine vehicles to be towed out.

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces. You should always check whether the machine is working and not assume free parking is available.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We had the intelligence… but actually we didn’t need it, because Putin announced his designs on Ukraine in public,” she said.“He set his plans down in black and white and put them up on the Kremlin’s website. But still we didn’t want to believe it.“Well, we believe it now. The world has woken up. The era of complacency is over. We must rise to this moment.”She said Russia had become a “global pariah”, with its only allies – aside from Eritrea – now “a vassal state, a rogue state, and a war criminal”.“In the UN General Assembly  countries voted to condemn Russia’s actions,” she said.“Putin’s only supporters were Syria, Eritrea, Belarus and North Korea. Never did we think the great nation of Russia would be reduced to this – aside from Eritrea, its only allies are now a vassal state, a rogue state, and a war criminal.“Putin is shunned and isolated. He has made his country a global pariah.”Making comparisons between the scale of the Ukraine crisis and the World Trade Centre terror attack in , Ms Truss said: “How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era.”While she said there had been a “phenomenal, united effort” to impose sanctions on the Kremlin, she insisted “we are not doing enough”, calling for allies to ramp up the pressure on Mr Putin’s regime.She went on to urge the international community to change its approach to dealing with antagonistic world leaders, saying it is time to end “strategic dependence” on hostile and authoritarian states, including a departure from using Russian energy.It comes after the UK and the US on Tuesday announced they will phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year as part of increased sanctions on Moscow.\" data-title\"POLITICS Ukraine\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aabdebcabcfedYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDcyNzk ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aabdebcabcfedYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDcyNzk ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aabdebcabcfedYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDcyNzk ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"She said countries should also be “exploring other possible areas of dependence”.“Whether it’s minerals or rare earth metals, we should work to prevent future problems before they emerge,” she said.Meanwhile, Ms Truss called on allies to strengthen deterrence, pointing out that many countries still do not meet the target of spending % of GDP on defence.And she said leaders must show support to non-Nato countries that “could be the next target of Putin’s aggression”, such as “our friends in the Caucuses and the Western Balkans”.“We also need to ensure that the global security architecture is fit for this new era,” she added. vw,vw,px, px\"“China looms large over this debate,” she said, with Beijing “increasing its assertiveness and expanding its armed forces at breakneck speed”.“They claim a policy of non-interference. They claim to respect sovereignty and have refused to support Russia’s aggression in the UN. We want to see them follow through on those claims,” she said.Ms Truss also called for “stronger alliances” to be formed around the world.“We should be drawing more countries into the orbit of those who are prepared to stand up for sovereignty,” she said.The Foreign Secretary admitted that “in the past we have sometimes neglected the strategic importance of some countries”, including partners in the Indo-Pacic, Africa and the Gulf. vw,vw,px, px\"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called for ‘stronger alliances’ to be formed around the world “They want alternatives to working with authoritarian regimes who load their balance sheets with debt. So we must provide that alternative,” she said.Ms Truss concluded by saying the West will “not rest” until the Russian president fails in Ukraine and the country’s sovereignty is restored.“Putin must lose, because the consequenceshe doesn’t would be huge,” she said.“So we will keep strengthening our response… replacing doubt with determination… complacency with conviction. We will never let our guard down again.“We will be tough… not because we want conflict, but because we want to prevent it.“Be tough, get peace.

The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial. The net-zero carbon roadmap produced for Belfast is enlightening in this regard. Currently, % of Belfast’s emissions come from the domestic housing sector, with transport responsible for % of emissions, public and commercial buildings for % and industry %.Belfast’s roadmap includes an assessment of the potential contribution of approximately  energy-saving or low-carbon measures.I don’t think anyone knows where the money is coming from to pay for these initiatives, but it may be the case that a slowness to act has brought us to the point where we can’t quibble on the cost.Andrew Webb is chief economist at Grant ThorntonMost ReadNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Top VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlay moments captured by photographer Mark Condren at the Ukraine borderPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest EnvironmentFrom Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth to Blue Planet – how environmentalism info is just a click awayFour main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyOur love affair with the car is poisoning very air we breathePedal power: Cycling Culcavy mum doing school run on two wheels after ditching carEnvironment In Focus: North West cricketers take on ‘responsibility’ of climate action as sport most vulnerable to changeLatestInjuries made Coleraine’s Lyndon Kane question his future in the game but now he’s aiming for League Cup gloryPackage for Lorraine Kelly sparked ITV security alert that forced shows off airUkraine: Putin faces ‘dramatic increased response’he uses chemical weaponsIreland boss Andy Farrell in no mood to engage with Eddie Jones’ mind gamesJarrod Bowen remains a major doubt for West Ham’s second leg against Sevilla,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He also judges in the obedience and agility categories.Michaelis joined by his we Kate, also a judge, and their son Crawfordwho is competing in the show with his border collie Denny.The popular dog show was on a two-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic but just yesterday the National Exhibition Centre saw tens of thousands of dogs and their handlers arrive to show off their prized pooches.Owners and pets will see dogs from around the world compete in the agility and obedience competitions over the next three days, as well as the show dogs organised by breed, although only one can be named top dog on Sunday in the ‘Best in Show’ category.The Northern Ireland team consists of three border collies, three golden retrievers, a black Labrador and a Sheltie cross — all hoping for a rosette.“We have a really strong team this year, with some really great handlers,” he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “What makes a winner at the end of the day, is pairing the right dog with the right person —the partnership isn’t right you won’t be on to a winner. “Normally the weak link is the human when there is a mismatch like that,” he added.“The dog is always the strongest and always wants to do its best but being paired with the wrong handler is usually what lets them down.”As a show of support for the local team, the Irish Football Associationhave sponsored all the leads and collars for the competition, as well as providing the pampered pooches with their very own Northern Ireland jerseys through the Urban Pup brand.Both Michael and his we Kate are obedience and agility judges, with Kate being named one of only two accredited obedience stewards for the show this year.He said it is a “huge honour for someone this side of the water”.“Northern Ireland only has one vote in the competition, compared to Wales and Scotland that have two, and the Midlands alone have four votes, so you need to be in the know to get a say and to know what you’re doing, so it’s a benefit to have me and Kate there,” he said.Due to their unique combined skills, the husband and we duo are normally flown to dog shows all across the world to judge.“Not many can do both and so we’d normally be sent to shows in the likes of the Netherlands, all across Europe, Singapore and even Abu Dhabi,” he said.Michael pointed out that judging is “a passion” of theirs.“We do this for the love of it and have been doing this for about  years now, but we have been involved with dog training for a lot longer,” he said.The McCartney family have been running Glen Craig Canine Training for the past  years from their home in Lisburn, but Michael said his love of dog training started from a young age when he joined the original Belfast Dog Training Club in  at the age of .“The club was where the peace line is now, between the Shankill and the Falls Roads in west Belfast. But when the Troubles broke out, they had to close it,” he said.“I remember seeing the poster on the wall advertising one of their meetings and I brought my first dog — a collie Labrador cross called Cap — and that was me hooked on dog training, from I was a wee lad.”Michael’s son, Crawford, has followed in his father’s footsteps.He first got involved in the young Kennel Club at the age of seven and has been competing in events ever since.Crawford has represented Ireland at both the European and World Agility Championships in previous years and also for the upcoming  competition.Michael said that it’s important to start training a dog as a pup.“From eight to  weeks they are like a sponge and will just soak up all that information,” he said. “Dogs just want to please you at the end of the day, and that is what we need to remember in this competition, as long as they get the rewards and positive reinforcement that they are doing a good job, they will do you proud, and we hope that is the case this year.”Most ReadNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Latest Northern IrelandInjuries made Coleraine’s Lyndon Kane question his future in the game but now he’s aiming for League Cup gloryFour main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyKieran McGeeney believes Armagh have to be more decisive to remain in Division One title huntUlster prepare for Leinster’s visit to Ravenhill knowing that the real fight to host a knockout match is just startingHeating oil firms facing abuse and tears as prices soarLatestInjuries made Coleraine’s Lyndon Kane question his future in the game but now he’s aiming for League Cup gloryPackage for Lorraine Kelly sparked ITV security alert that forced shows off airUkraine: Putin faces ‘dramatic increased response’he uses chemical weaponsIreland boss Andy Farrell in no mood to engage with Eddie Jones’ mind gamesJarrod Bowen remains a major doubt for West Ham’s second leg against Sevilla,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAuditor Kieran Donnelly, Credit: .Garrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe NI Audit Office has described the Department for the Economy’s failure to learn from the Renewable Heating Incentivescheme as “completely unacceptable” after highlighting a number of irregularities in its expenditure.Mr Kieran Donnelly, Comptroller and Auditor General , has issued reports on the results of his audits of the - annual report and accounts of the Department for the Economyand Invest NI .The reports summarise his assessment of both sets of accounts, which largely relate to grant support schemes launched in response to the Covid- pandemic.In -, DfE’s net expenditure totalled £. billion, a substantial increase from £. billion in -.INI’s net expenditure also increased by £. million to a total of £ million. This was largely due to the implementation of a number of emergency grant schemes, designed to provide support to businesses and iniduals subject to closure or restrictions.Mr Donnelly’s reports highlight four Covid schemes, totalling £ million, which, although recorded in Invest NI’s accounts, were actually controlled and administered by DfE. These include the Small Business Grant Scheme and the Tourism and Retail Sectors Grant.INI was instructed by the department to include the expenditure within its accounts as it had the correct legal powers to make the payments, whereas the department did not.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Donnelly concluded that INI had no role in the schemes’ design or delivery and that the schemes were actually administered by the department, meaning that the expenditure should have been recorded in the DfE’s accounts.It also means that the expenditure was incurred by DfE without the appropriate legal authority. As a result, he has qualied both sets of accounts on the basis that this expenditure was “irregular”.He also concluded that INI’s financial statements did not provide a true and fair view of the substance of the transactions and he has provided an adverse opinion on Invest NI’s accounts on that basis.Both the department and INI were provided with an opportunity to adjust their accounts to resolve the issues identied by the audit. They both declined to do so as they do not agree with the independent opinion of the CAG.This disagreement has, in part, contributed to the lateness of certication and publication of the annual report and accounts of both organisations.Mr Donnelly commented: “My report acknowledges the speed with which these support schemes were designed and delivered.“It is important to stress, though, that the issues I have identied do not merely pertain to technical matters, but to fundamental principles and standards of accounting with which all public bodies should comply.”The report also sets out the CAG’s qualication relating to Covid- business support schemes administered by Invest NI totalling £. million in -.Based on how these schemes were designed, INI relied on self-declarations by applicants as evidence that certain eligibility criteria had been met, with no corroborating evidence. As a result there was “insufficient audit evidence” to confirm that expenditure was regular.These schemes were launched at pace in response to the continued impact of the pandemic on Northern Ireland’s economy.Approval for their implementation was granted by Ministerial Direction, since the Department’s Accounting Officer was unable to provide evidence that these schemes would provide value for money or that there would not be an unacceptably high risk of error or loss of funds.In addition, Mr Donnelly’s report on INI notes “irregular income and expenditure” relating to a £. million loan made in previous years to Glenmore Generation Limited – an anaerobic digestion facility.The Department of Financeconsidered this loan to be irregular, because certain conditions of its approval had not been complied with and further approval had not been sought.Irregularities were also highlighted in relation to a £.m payment to Tourism Ireland Limited, where again DoF approval was not obtained.Commenting on these qualications to the accounts, Mr Donnelly said: “It is completely unacceptable that a Department fails to comply with the requirements of primary legislation it is relying on to make payments.“This is a basic requirement, and it is extremely disappointing to see that the Department has failed to learn lessons from its past failure on obtaining approvals required for the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme.”INI published its - Annual Report  Accounts on Wednesday. They say the accounts have been qualied by the NI Audit Office in two areas – expenditure relating to NI Executive Covid emergency response schemes and expenditure relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility.Responding to the qualications Mel Chittock, Interim CEO, Invest NI said: “We acknowledge the decision of the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualy our accounts.“The global pandemic was an unprecedented situation which required implementation and operation of emergency schemes outside of normal process.“I am confident that all the necessary steps were taken to provide the best solutions to get much needed emergency funding to businesses. We complied fully with the instructions given to us and NIAO found no irregularities.”Addressing the qualication relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility in more detail, she said under the Sustainable Utilisation of Poultry LitterScheme INI provided funding towards the build and operation of two anaerobic digestion plants.“The aim was to help resolve a signicant local environmental issue and to help Northern Ireland comply with EU nitrates targets, as well as provide economic benefits by supporting growth in the agri-food sector,” Ms Chittock said.“It was always understood that the development of anaerobic digestion plants using innovative technologies was high risk. This risk was balanced against the environmental and economic benefits to the NI economy.“The Glenmore facility encountered technical and operational dficulties and in  the owner operator decided to refinance the business. As a result, Invest NI, and the main funder, will not receive aon the initial investment made.“However, the plant remains operational, is contributing to the objectives of the SUPL Scheme, and producing green energy for two NI manufacturing businesses.”A review highlighted that there could have been improvements in Invest NI internal processes and that it could have taken more steps to better mitigate and manage the loan investment in this project.However, the Department of Finance concluded that some of the conditions it put in place around the loan were not met, and now views the loan as an irregular spend.INI insists that it has tightened its processes and procedures and formed a new Invest NI Governance Council focussed on implementing best practice and improvements right across the organisation.A DfE spokesperson said as the Covid crisis gripped the country, the department and its arm’sbodies responded immediately, with  schemes delivered at a cost of £m. which helped tens of thousands of local businesses.It is therefore disappointing, and not for the first time, that the Department is forced to clary its position following an NIAO report,” he added.“The Department’s accounts were presented to the NIAO in May , as agreed. A delay arose because of the NIAO’s interpretation of an accounting issue it had not raised the previous year when the same schemes were delivered.Despite obtaining extensive and robust legal advice supporting its approach, the Department was unable to persuade the NIAO of its position a position that was universally accepted and supported across Government.The Department’s Accounting Officer shared his legal opinion and wider supporting documentation with the NIAO in an attempt to agree a consensus. Unfortunately, a resolution to what was, and remains, a subjective issue in accounting terms, prevented the accounts from being laid on time as anticipated.”Most ReadNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Top VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlay moments captured by photographer Mark Condren at the Ukraine borderPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest Northern IrelandInjuries made Coleraine’s Lyndon Kane question his future in the game but now he’s aiming for League Cup gloryFour main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyUlster prepare for Leinster’s visit to Ravenhill knowing that the real fight to host a knockout match is just startingKieran McGeeney believes Armagh have to be more decisive to remain in Division One title huntHeating oil firms facing abuse and tears as prices soarLatestMore than half of young people ‘have been targeted by fraudsters’Fair Game: Cha crisis result of culture of ignoring financial sustainabilityInjuries made Coleraine’s Lyndon Kane question his future in the game but now he’s aiming for League Cup gloryPackage for Lorraine Kelly sparked ITV security alert that forced shows off airUkraine: Putin faces ‘dramatic increased response’he uses chemical weapons,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

True, our sportsmen, sportswomen and teams gave us much to cheer about and lted our hearts at times when there was little to celebrate. Sport did indeed keep going in the midst of adversity. But, looking back as an on-the-spot reporter, the notion of sport as an oasis of peace and harmony is just a tad revisionist.My job on the sports desk of the Belfastdid indeed seem normal compared to the work of my news-desk colleagues, who recorded more deadly scores as the body count mounted. But every now and then tensions on the streets spilled on to the terraces and sport migrated to the front pages for all the wrong reasons.My own personal baptism of fire arrived just two months into my Tele career, ignited by that bloody August Bank Holiday Monday of . Twenty-three people had died: four in the attack on Lord Mountbatten’s fishing boat off the Sligo coast eighteen soldiers in a double blast at Narrow Water, near Warrenpoint, all at the hands of the Provos and, largely forgotten, a curious English visitor, drawn to the water’s edge on the southern side of Carlingford Lough by the first blast at Narrow Water, who was shot dead by a panicking trooper who mistook him for one of the bombers. In the midst of the madness unleashed that sunny day, with community tensions stretched like piano wire and emotions off the scale, someone in the upper echelons of European football – and likewise the security services on both sides of the border – thought it a good idea to send Linfield to Dundalk, which is a few miles across the border in the Republic of Ireland, two days later for a European Cup tie. Talk about quenching flames with petrol.Context is everything for those born in the ensuing decades. Today, a Dundalk–Linfield game would not raise an eyebrow, let alone the state of high alert that accompanied the fixture in . Back then, Linfield was an exclusively Protestant team and club, drawing its support from staunch loyalist areas. The first Catholic players did not arrive until the s. Today, the team is fully inclusive. Dundalk at that time would have been a safe haven for on-the-run republicans and their sympathisers. A combustible mix at the worst of times. The events of that Bank Holiday Monday made the violence that would erupt inside and outside Oriel Park two nights later an absolute certainty – the blood was up – and still it was allowed to go ahead.Knowing what was going to happen, we journeyed like moths to a flame: our boss Malcolm Brodie in the driving seat of his Honda Accord automatic colleagues Bill Ireland, Gordon Hanna and me, his passengers. Three great newspaper men and sports writers, sadly no longer with us, and me, too young and foolish to be apprehensive and for whom the trip seemed like a great adventure. The reports they filed that night were never going to be about football. The normally bustling Dundalk we arrived in that afternoon was a ghost town, with the owners of pubs and shops hastily pulling down their shutters as word reached them of a pub wrecked by a busload of Linfield supporters in nearby Ravensdale. There wasn’t a Blueman in sight when we got there, but an advance party had clearly arrived as a Union Jack was fluttering from the Maid of Erin statue in Market Square. It was the calm before the storm.A blind man on a galloping horse could have seen the violence coming. Three thousand Linfield fans in a fleet of sixty buses descended on the border town where the local hoods were waiting, ready to defend their title. Gardaí, some not even in riot gear, were hopelessly unprepared, and outnumbered. Undisciplined stewards – bizarrely clad in white coats and resembling cricket umpiresDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up – attempted to drive back the rampaging Linfield hordes using wooden cudgels but were overrun. Worse still, the section housing the away fans was strewn with rubble that ought to have been cleared, completely negating the point of the police searches at the turnstiles. And a thin line of barbed wire was all that separated the goading Dundalk fans and police line from the snarling Linfield mob, who chewed it up and spat it out as they launched their attacks.An estimated  to  of the ,-plus Linfield supporters were involved in the violence, but, fuelled by drink and anger, they generated the sound and fury of ten times their number. However regular fans later asserted that many of these ‘supporters’ had never been to a Linfield match before.Unbelievably, at the outset, gardaí clodded stones back at them! The police baton-charged again and again but were driven back under the unreserved stand before calling in reinforcements. The trouble continued, despite appeals over the PA system by Dundalk and Linfield officials, and by Bluemen in the stands who were not involved in the violence and who tried to remonstrate with the mob. An uneasy peace settled, particularly after Warren Feeney scored the opening Linfield goal – though immediately after it, full back Terry Hayes was felled by a stone thrown from the Dundalk end. But more trouble was to develop. A tricolour was set alight at the Linfield end and, in response, the Dundalk crowd ripped up and burned a Union Jack.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn injured garda is led away from the pitch FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn injured garda is led away from the pitchComing up to half-time, the violence worsened, with more stone-throwing and more baton charges. However, at this stage, the gardaí appeared to be settling for a policy of trying to reason with the fans – at that stage they made no arrests and allowed the Linfield supporters not involved in the trouble to keep things under control.That plan soon broke down, however, and all hell was let loose during half-time, with vicious fighting, and Linfield fans up on the roof of the stand trying to remove the tricolour that was flying at full mast. Injured gardaí, many with blood streaming down their faces, were helped out of the ground and some stewards were also among the casualties. So, too, were a number of Linfield fans who had been arrested. We saw one dragged by police through the tearoom with blood gushing from a head wound.Dundalk officials continued to make appeals for order over the loudspeaker: ‘You are doing your club no good. Please stop firing missiles,’ they pleaded, to no avail. Later, when the teams took the field again, some of the Linfield players, led by their player-manager Roy Coyle, walked straight to the Linfield section involved in the violence and pleaded for order. Legendary captain Peter Rafferty and Feeney, scorer of Linfield’s goal, also appealed. Rafferty said afterwards, ‘There was one boy, and the smell of drink from his breath nearly made me drunk. Quite honestly, I’ve never seen any of those people at Windsor Park before.’They settled, but not for long. One fan climbed up on to the roof of the ground, and again tried to pull down the tricolour. He was tackled by a steward, who pelted the youth with stones and then retreated. And that was more or less the prelude for a big baton charge from gardaí. About three hundred of them rushed forwards, stepped over the barbed wire, which had been practically pulled asunder, and drove the Linfield fans back. More stones rained down on them, but they pushed on, driving the rioters back into the vast section of Linfield fans not involved, and who had earlier howled their disapproval of it all.At one stage, stewards rushed across the pitch while the game was continuing, but renowned referee Pat Partridge hardly noticed it. Meanwhile, behind the Linfield goal, the supporters were being driven back further and further into one corner.The casualty and arrest list by this time had increased signicantly. Order of Malta members had set up an impromptu First Aid room under the main stand before the ambulances arrived. Then the trouble spilled outside into Carrick Road. Three houses, a supermarket and a filling station were attacked and had windows smashed as the Linfield fans made their way back to the buses taking them home, parked up by the Harp brewery. The buses, too, were attacked, with more windows broken. Several had been smashed on the way to Dundalk as well, injuring some Linfield supporters.Meanwhile, in the Dundalk boardroom after the game, Linfield secretary Derek Brookes condemned the violence and, in particular, the troublemakers clad in blue. Their conduct, he said, had disgraced the club. ‘Unfortunately,’ said Mr Brookes, ‘they ignored our appeals for order, and Roy Coyle did his best as well. Fortunately, the hooligans were greatly outnumbered by genuine fans, and the game itself was played in a magnicent spirit. There was hardly a serious foul.’ Dundalk chairman Oliver Quinn said he was ‘sad and disappointed’. Referee Partridge said he wanted to make no comment, and neither would the UEFA observer at the match, Leo Callaghan from Wales. ‘It’s all here in my notes,’ he said. ‘But I don’t want to say anything. I’ll be making my report.’That report resulted in Linfield being held almost entirely accountable, being forced to pay Dundalk’s costs to travel to the Netherlands as well as an additional £, for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £ for providing insufficient security at the match. In an ironic postscript, Dundalk went on to defeat Maltese minnows Hibernians in the next round before drawing Celtic. The events of that night forty-two years ago in Dundalk showed Belfast would not have been ready for a match like that had it been Linfield who progressed.When order was finally restored as the Blue hordes left a shattered town, the ‘score’ was:  gardaí hurt  civilians injured, including  Linfield fans and a girl who remained in hospital the next day and  arrests made – mostly Linfield supporters, who appeared in court the next day and were fined.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and RTE journalist Charlie Bird with Ivan Little and Deric Henderson during the launch of Reporting the Troubles  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and RTE journalist Charlie Bird with Ivan Little and Deric Henderson during the launch of Reporting the Troubles And while the match itself yielded a £, ‘gate’, the Dundalk club revealed that the cost of staging the match, and paying for the damage would wipe out their profit. Linfield paid a high price, too, and not just reputational. UEFA chiefs quickly decided the club should carry the can for their supporters’ actions and ordered theleg to be played in Haarlem, Holland. Amid it all, a football match broke out, a credit to every player on the pitch and, fittingly, it ended in a – draw, Dundalk progressing with a – win, where Linfield’s goal scorer at Oriel Park, Warren Feeney, missed a penalty.That riot in  was by far the worst I have witnessed in a football ground in forty-two years chronicling the game here, and there have been many: the battle on the pitch at the end of the  Linfield–Glentoran Irish Cup final at Windsor the  final between the same clubs at which burning rafters rained down from inside the roof of the unreserved stand at The Oval Linfield–Donegal Celtic in  Cltonville–Celtic in the week of the internment anniversary in , when fans fought running battles with police who fired plastic bullets inside the ground, and when a service revolver was snatched and later used to murder an off-duty UDR soldier and the murder of reserve police officer David Purse, who was on duty at a Crusaders match at Seaview in . And so it went on through the s and s, the almost routine football disorder a microcosm of a violent and ided society.The fact that Dundalk has played without incident at Windsor in recent years shows how far most of us have come in the long, drawn-out decades of peace- and confidence-building since. And that has to be the biggest blessed relief of all.Jim Gracey was group sports editor of Belfast  Sunday Le, and spent over forty years reporting on local, national and international sport, including five football World Cups.

The festival was last held in .Cllr Hanna said that while it was disappointing that this yearrsquos event would not be going ahead, a number of suggestions for an alternative festival had been made. He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough. He steadied himself and began to address his companions.lsquoHe lted one hand and pointed ahead. He named the parts. He spoke of horses and ploughing points. He strained and balanced and explained.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

As with all aspects of museum work, this required both local and specialist knowledge, active travelling around the area and respectful relationships with the community.The museum developed a unique relationship with the community that was based on valuing and understanding the importance of lsquopeople and placersquo. The generous support of the community has been instrumental in creating the award-winning treasure-house that is the Down County Museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Downpatrick Family Autism Group fundraising to help get new home  ","story":"A FUNDRAISING drive towards establishing a new base has been launched by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.The group aims to raise pound, over the next year to create a centre in the town for its dedicated use.The supports  families with at least one child which has autism.Project co-ordinator Aine Sloan explained that parents believe the centre is needed for the development of their children and the group in general.ldquoWe want to make a practical dference to the children and young people and their families by providing a strong support network, she said.ldquoOur activities and events are a good way for families to get to talk to one another and realise they are not alone.ldquoIt is very important to have the opportunity to meet others who understand the daily challenges and struggles they face as a family.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July. It will replace the townrsquos previous mart which closed two years ago.However, the mart is part of a much larger project which includes plans for animal processing facilities, a conference centre and extensive retailing outlets.Mr Hugh Linehan, chairman of the co-operative, says it will be the most advanced project of its kind in Northern Ireland and will bring jobs and wealth to the area.ldquoWe see this as the way ahead for local agriculture, Mr Linehan said yesterday.Funding for the mart phase is largely complete.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

We are interested in solutions and putting people first and the Fishing and Seafood Development programme is one solution we must deliver on.ldquoI hope voters will remember issues such as this in May as they will be the people who elect a new Executive.Cllr Curran said the fishing and fish processing industries were an essential part of le in Ardglass and the local economy.ldquoThese industries must be protected and enhanced and this is all achievable, he declared.ldquoIt is welcome news that approval has been given for the programmersquos strategic outline case which allows DAERA to procure consultants to take forward detailed environmental and technical studies.ldquoHowever, this approval only allows DAERA to incur expenditure on work required to inform the later outline business cases upon which any later decisions to proceed with infrastructure development, such as the deepening of Ardglass harbour will be based.Cllr Curran said he hoped that the absence of the NI Executive and the uncertainty of its future does not obstruct the progress of the ldquovital fishing programme which offers so much potential for Ardglass and other local ports..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Regional rates frozen for business owners  ","story":"BUSINESSES and ratepayers have received some good news with confirmation that the regional rate has been frozen for another year.The decision by Stormont finance minister Conor Murphy is part of a poundm province-wide rates support package for the new financial year.He has also confirmed that the small business rate relief scheme benefiting thousands of business premises will also continue, explaining the message from businesses is that the rates holiday was a vital leline for them during the pandemic.The finance minister said the poundm rates support package to support the recovery will provide all businesses with a one month rates holiday with the exception of utilities and larger food stores while retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare, newspapers and airports will receive a three months rates holiday.Mr Murphy said businesses in the hardest hit sectors had paid no rates since March  and will now pay no rates until July.He said freezing the regional rate is intended to help with the rising costs being faced by families and businesses alike, with the extension of the small business rate relief scheme resulting in businesses automatically receiving a reduction of between % and % on their rates.The finance minister added: ldquoSmall businesses are at the core of our local economy and have a vital role in contributing to employment opportunities.ldquoI am glad to announce the continuation of the small business rate relief scheme which currently supports almost , business premises. The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

This is really about our clubs playing a role in their communities and being able to develop.“Sub-regional is the biggest gt this committee, or through the minister, could give to sport and that’s what we’re crying out for.”The comments came during a wide-ranging set of hearings on women in sport.NIFL said that despite signicant progress in recent years, more work is needed to encourage and support women in football.Women’s football in Northern Ireland received a boost last year, when the ladies’ squad made history by qualying for the Euro  tournament.That unprecedented success in qualying for a major tournament was repeatedly referenced by politicians at the committee yesterday, with members heaping praise on the team.Footballing officials pointed to signicant strides made in recent years, with large crowds attending matches and more opportunities for coverage on TV.Steven Mills, the chief operating officer at NIFL, said it was important that more women were in leadership roles in the organisation.“We are getting better at giving them a voice and supporting them. There’s certainly more work to be done,” he said.Northern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularShotgun and ammunition discovered in NI town - appeal for informationWATCH: Built-in-Belfast tungsten-tipped Starstreak missile to be shipped to Ukraine warzone for use in destroying Russian aircraftOver , ‘built in Belfast’ NLAW anti-tank bazookas sent to UkraineUVF murders of my dad and uncle gave our family a letime of trauma -  years ago today: European Remembrance Day for Victims of TerrorismPrice of home heating oil in Northern Ireland doubles in less than a fortnightMost PopularAldi’s sell-out pet sofa is back for  - how to buy, and the best alternative pet sofas UKBest multi cookers UK : the best electric and multicookers including the Ninja Foodi MaxBest garden parasols UK : garden umbrellas for blocking sun and wind, from Wayfair, Maisons Du MondeBest walking shoes UK : the best men’s shoes for hiking and walking from Salomon, Inov-, and MerrellIceland launches supersized £ Cadbury Creme Egg dessert in time for Easter                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Most of the land is currently vacant.A pedestrian footbridge over the Cardf Bay Link road would connect to the proposed new arena development, which is likely to get planning permission on Wednesday, March .Cllr Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: “One of the ways in which we will ensure that a signicant amount of the pedestrians leaving the arena on an event day doesn’t go past residential properties iswe can get that additional station on Pierhead Street.“Because then people would be able to walk out of the arena, across the public square, and then over a new bridge which will take them to that station and then off to the east of Cardf.”He was addressing the council’s cabinet on Thursday, March , about the wider regeneration plans across Cardf Bay. These include turning Lloyd George Avenue into a linear park and upgrading the cycling lanes there, building a velodrome at the International Sports Village, building a new lido near Techniquest, and hosting events at Alexandra Head.As well as building a ,-capacity arena, the wider redevelopment of Atlantic Wharf would also see the Travelodge hotel and Red Dragon Centre relocated, new museums, a multi-storey car park, hotels, apartments, a new tourist attraction, and a public square. Most of this would be built where the Red Dragon Centre, County Hall and car parks currently are.But some concerns already raised by local residents include the noise of bands playing at the arena, and thousands of people leaving after a concert late at night. Having a new metro station at Pierhead Street could ert those people away from houses and flats nearby..removeTransport for Wales is due to start working on the railway along Lloyd George Avenue this August, electrying the track. The current route to Cardf Bay only stops at Queen Street station, and not Central station, but could soon be upgraded to stop there too. Another new station could also be built at Loudon Square.A recent cabinet report said: “The initial phase of the Cardf Bayproject is due to start on site in August , and the plans to link the new line into Cardf Central and onto a new station at Roath Basin are moving rapidly through the design phases.“The council is working with the Welsh Government to extend the current investment in the Core Valley Lines extension, to provide a direct link to Cardf Central station and to extend the line further into Cardf Bay, connecting to a proposed new transport hub at Pierhead Street, and onto a new station at Roath Basin.“This would essentially form the first phase of the council’s Crossrail project. Positive discussions have taken place and remain ongoing with the owner of the Pierhead Street site, which has been identied as the preferred location for the new Cardf Bay transport hub.“Later phases of the council’s Crossrail project will see new stations delivered at Splott, Tremorfa, Newport Road and then onto the proposed new Cardf Parkway mainline station, providing the first public transport rail infrastructure for the east of Cardf.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a speech in the US on Thursday, the Cabinet minister said the West’s prior “illusions” that “the spread of peace and stability was inevitable” had been “shattered” by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s aggression towards his neighbour.Giving the Makins Lecture at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, Ms Truss said the Western world was now “paying the price” for “years of complacency”, as Russia “built its capabilities in plain sight”.“We knew what Putin was doing. We had the intelligence… but actually we didn’t need it, because Putin announced his designs on Ukraine in public,” she said.“He set his plans down in black and white and put them up on the Kremlin’s website. But still we didn’t want to believe it.“Well, we believe it now. The world has woken up. The era of complacency is over. We must rise to this moment.”She said Russia had become a “global pariah”, with its only allies – aside from Eritrea – now “a vassal state, a rogue state, and a war criminal”.“In the UN General Assembly  countries voted to condemn Russia’s actions,” she said.“Putin’s only supporters were Syria, Eritrea, Belarus and North Korea. Never did we think the great nation of Russia would be reduced to this – aside from Eritrea, its only allies are now a vassal state, a rogue state, and a war criminal.“Putin is shunned and isolated. He has made his country a global pariah.”Making comparisons between the scale of the Ukraine crisis and the World Trade Centre terror attack in , Ms Truss said: “How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era.”While she said there had been a “phenomenal, united effort” to impose sanctions on the Kremlin, she insisted “we are not doing enough”, calling for allies to ramp up the pressure on Mr Putin’s regime..removeShe went on to urge the international community to change its approach to dealing with antagonistic world leaders, saying it is time to end “strategic dependence” on hostile and authoritarian states, including a departure from using Russian energy.It comes after the UK and the US on Tuesday announced they will phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year as part of increased sanctions on Moscow.\" data-title\"POLITICS Ukraine\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aabdebcabcfedYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDcyNzk ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aabdebcabcfedYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDcyNzk ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aabdebcabcfedYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDcyNzk ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"She said countries should also be “exploring other possible areas of dependence”.“Whether it’s minerals or rare earth metals, we should work to prevent future problems before they emerge,” she said.Meanwhile, Ms Truss called on allies to strengthen deterrence, pointing out that many countries still do not meet the target of spending % of GDP on defence.And she said leaders must show support to non-Nato countries that “could be the next target of Putin’s aggression”, such as “our friends in the Caucuses and the Western Balkans”.“We also need to ensure that the global security architecture is fit for this new era,” she added.“China looms large over this debate,” she said, with Beijing “increasing its assertiveness and expanding its armed forces at breakneck speed”.“They claim a policy of non-interference. They claim to respect sovereignty and have refused to support Russia’s aggression in the UN. We want to see them follow through on those claims,” she said.Ms Truss also called for “stronger alliances” to be formed around the world.“We should be drawing more countries into the orbit of those who are prepared to stand up for sovereignty,” she said.The Foreign Secretary admitted that “in the past we have sometimes neglected the strategic importance of some countries”, including partners in the Indo-Pacic, Africa and the Gulf. vw,vw,px, px\"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called for ‘stronger alliances’ to be formed around the world “They want alternatives to working with authoritarian regimes who load their balance sheets with debt. So we must provide that alternative,” she said.Ms Truss concluded by saying the West will “not rest” until the Russian president fails in Ukraine and the country’s sovereignty is restored.“Putin must lose, because the consequenceshe doesn’t would be huge,” she said.“So we will keep strengthening our response… replacing doubt with determination… complacency with conviction. We will never let our guard down again.“We will be tough… not because we want conflict, but because we want to prevent it.“Be tough, get peace.

Some of the vehicles have moved into forests, Maxar reported, with towed howitzers nearby in position to open fire.The convoy had massed outside the city early last week, but its advance appeared to stall as reports of food and fuel shortages circulated.US officials said Ukrainian troops also targeted the convoy with anti-tank missiles. vw,vw,px, px\"A long line of people and cars waiting by the damaged Irpin River bridge during the Russian invasion, in Irpin Russian forces were continuing their offensive toward Kyiv from the northwest and east, notably trying to break through Ukrainian defences from Kukhari,  miles to the northwest, through to Demidov,  miles north of Kyiv, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in a statement..removeMeanwhile, Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered that so-called volunteer fighters should be brought into Ukraine.Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia knew of “more than , applications” from countries in the Middle East, many of them from people who he said helped Russia against the so-called Islamic State group, according to a Kremlin transcript.They want “to take part in what they consider a liberation movement”, Mr Shoigu said, on the side of Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.Since , Russian forces have backed Syrian president Bashar Assad against ious groups opposed to his rule, including Islamic State.Mr Putin told Mr Shoigu that Russia should help would-be volunteers to “move to the combat zone” and contrasted them with what he called foreign “mercenaries” fighting for Ukraine.A US defence official said Russian forces moving toward Kyiv had advanced about three miles in the past  hours, with some elements as close as nine miles from the city.The official gave no indication that the convoy had dispersed or otherwise repositioned in a signicant way, saying some vehicles were seen moving off the road into the tree line in recent days.In Mariupol, a southern seaport of ,, the situation was increasingly dire as civilians trapped inside the city scrounged for food and fuel. vw,vw,px, px\"Destroyed Russian tanks are seen on a main road after battles near Broy, north of Kyiv More than , people have died in the -day siege of the city, according to deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk.Residents have no heat or phone service, and many have no electricity. Night-time temperatures are regularly below freezing, and daytime ones normally hover just above it. Bodies are being buried in mass graves. The streets are littered with burned-out cars, broken glass and splintered trees.“They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,” Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation.Repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians have been thwarted by Russian shelling, Ukrainian authorities said.The number of refugees fleeing the country topped . million, and some , people have been evacuated during the past two days from seven cities under Russian blockade in the north and centre of the country, including the Kyiv suburbs, Mr Zelensky said. vw,vw,px, px\"Firefighters help a woman from a building in Mariupol He told Russian leaders that the invasion will backfire on them as their economy is strangled.Western sanctions have already dealt a severe blow, causing the rouble to plunge, foreign businesses to flee and prices to rise sharply.“You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes,” Mr Zelensky said in a video address, warning that “you will be hated by Russian citizens”.Mr Putin dismissed such talk, saying the country has endured sanctions before. vw,vw,px, px\"A man in a street damaged by shelling in Mariupol ″We will overcome them,” he said at a televised meeting of government officials. He did, however, acknowledge the sanctions create “certain challenges”.In addition to those who have fled the country, millions have been driven from their homes inside Ukraine. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said about two million people, half the population of the metropolitan area, have left the capital.“Every street, every house… is being fortied,” he said. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in unorm with machine guns in their hands.”Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days and are seeing heavier losses and stfer Ukrainian resistance than Moscow apparently anticipated.But Mr Putin’s forces have used air power and artillery to pummel Ukraine’s cities..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Russian convoy fans out around Kyiv, new satellite photos show article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Unfortunately we never know when someone near to us may need the services of AANI so let’s all try and raise some very valuable funds. “ On the day, Oonagh will also be joined by fellow AANI agribusiness group members, Martyn Blair and Barclay Bell. They are encouraging others from the agricultural sector to change the wellies for walking shoes on Sunday, May and join them for a walk, a chat and hopefully raise some funds for a great cause.
