Now, both men are plaintiffs in the lawsuit claiming that GM has done nothing to address the culture of discrimination in the workplace and failed to protect its workers.According to Taylor, who has worked for GM since 1978, expressions of racial hostility at the factory in Toledo were not limited to nooses.\u0027When I’d go to the bathrooms, I saw Nazi symbols on the walls and Hate blacks and Blacks shouldn’t be here,\u0027 he told the paper. In April of last year, Edwards said he was seated at a computer station when a white co-worker walked up to him, informed him that he was in his seat, called him the N-word and then pulled the chair from under him.Both Edwards and Taylor, who witnessed the incident, reported what happened to their union representative and the plant\u0027s human resources, but they say nothing came of their complaint. Silence in the face of their tears: GM chief Mary Barra\u0027s...Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin claims his Twitter account...Share this article    Edwards says he took this photo after discovering the noose hanging above his work station at the plant in March 2017 For Edwards, the alleged lack of action was nothing new: the veteran factory worker said he has endured racial discrimination for years without anyone in management doing anything to stop it. GM has pushed back against Edwards\u0027 version of events, saying it had workers at the Toledo plant undergo anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training following the noose incident last year. \u0027Every day, everyone at General Motors is expected to uphold a set of values that are integral to the fabric of our culture. Discrimination and harassment are not acceptable and in stark contrast to how we expect people to show up at work,\u0027 the car maker said in a statement. \u0027General Motors is taking this matter seriously and addressing it through the appropriate court process.\u0027But according to the recently filed lawsuit, the harassment targeting black employees continued, including one instance in which a white plant worker reportedly threw a rope at a black colleague, which earned him a 30-day suspension.           The complaint lists examples of racial harassment directed at African-American staff, including  \u0027whites only\u0027 signs painted on bathroom stalls (pictured)The lawsuit alleges that on one occasion, a white supervisor said during a meeting: \u0027what\u0027s the big deal about nooses? There was never a black person who was lynched that didn\u0027t deserve it.\u0027GM officials told the paper  that after the March 2017 noose incident, the company and the workers\u0027 union together produced a memo saying that the automaker has a zero tolerance policy for workplace violence or harassment. The memo was given out to each of the plant\u0027s 1,700 employees.GM said it has taken a host of other steps to ensure that the work environment is \u0027safe, open and inclusive,\u0027 such as training sessions at multiple plants, employee meeting and newsletters.          GM said that discrimination and harassment are unacceptable, and that the company has been conducting training sessions for staffIn March 2018, months before the lawsuit was filed against GM, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission found probable cause that \u0027GM engaged in unlawful discriminatory practices and ordered the company to take immediate action in order to provide its staff with a work environment free of harassment and hostility.A GM spokesperson said the automaker fully cooperated with the commission\u0027s investigation but disagreed with its findings. The lawsuit brought against the car maker seeks monetary compensation for lost wages and mental anguish, and also demands that GM fire employees responsible for creating a hostile work environment as a necessary step in overhauling the workplace culture. The complaint also calls for the company to step up security at the Toledo plant and erase any racist graffiti.   Nooses, Nazis and racist slurs tolerated at GM plant, lawsuit says"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/29/17/1BA46F62000005DC-0-image-m-39_1543511671591.jpg","title":"Former boss Network Rail given CBE regulator savages firm","story":"    The former head of Network Rail, Mark Carne, was controversially given a CBE today. The executive - pictured in 2012 - asked that no photos of the ceremony be made publicMr Carne spent five years overseeing the country’s rail infrastructure on behalf of the Department for Transport.But just before he lined up to meet the Duke of Cambridge yesterday, Britain’s rail watchdog announced it had launched enforcement action against Network Rail, accusing it of failing to do even the basics to operate a reliable service.Revealing train punctuality had fallen to the lowest level for more than 15 years, the Office of Rail and Road said the public body may have breached ‘condition one’ of its network licence with the Government. This requires it to run the railways efficiently and ensure the trains run on time. It is the first time the rail regulator has issued such a rebuke to the network owner in a decade.The watchdog ordered Network Rail to take ‘urgent action’ to address ‘systemic’ failings, which have resulted in months of disruption for passengers.          The award came on the same day the rail regulator slammed his former company\u0027s planning, which had led to passengers suffering delays and crowding on servicesLabour MP Wes Streeting said: ‘Network Rail itself has to shoulder enormous responsibility for the rail misery that has blighted the lives of so many passengers.\u0027If the wind was blowing the other way, I\u0027d be brown...Savvy London commuter, 28, saves £270-a-year by ditching the...Share this article    Customers were left fuming after scores are trains were cancelled amid timetable changes  First, strikes... now rail fare rises: Transport Secretary Chris Grayling blames union pay demands as train companies reveal New Year increases By James Salmon for the Daily Mail            Train fares are set to be increased today, with Transport Secretary Chris Grayling (seen today) blaming the union demands for inflation-busting pay rises for rail staffTrain fares are set to be increased today, with Transport Secretary Chris Grayling blaming the union demands for inflation-busting pay rises for rail staff.The rail industry will announce how much ‘unregulated’ fares, such as advance and first-class tickets, will go up by in January.The new prices, to be introduced on websites including National Rail Enquiries from 7am, will provoke anger among commuters, who have endured years of fare rises, strikes and deteriorating service.The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies and Network Rail, will also reveal how much the average train fare will go up by.This includes both unregulated fares, which are set by train operators, and regulated fares such as season tickets for commuters which are set by the Government in line with July’s Retail Prices Index measure of inflation.Passengers have already been told that the cost of regulated fares will rise by up to 3.2 per cent in January, adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of many season tickets. The overall average price hike is market sensitive and was not disclosed last night.The prospect of more increases has reopened a row between the Government and union bosses, who continue to demand steep pay rises for their members.The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, which has orchestrated crippling strikes across the country, is refusing to ditch the higher measure of RPI of inflation as a starting point for pay negotiations, despite the fact it has been widely discredited.In August, Mr Grayling urged unions to switch to the official CPI measure of inflation, but union bosses have refused to negotiate and instead threatened to stage more protests if pay curbs are imposed.Huw Merriman, a Tory MP and member of the Commons transport committee, said last night: ‘It cannot be right that the rail unions receive a higher wage based on RPI when most passengers, who fund these pay deals, only get pay rises using the lower CPI.‘If the unions are really serious about limiting fare rises, they should accept the same method for setting pay which their passengers are limited to, rather than threatening more strike misery.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markles Irish ancestors moved island going America","story":"    These extraordinary photos show a happy and carefree Duchess of Sussex on holiday in Malta just over a year before she first locked eyes with her future husbandThe REAL reason why Harry and Meghan are moving away from...EXCLUSIVE: George and Amal Clooney set to become Prince...Share this articleIt was taken when Meghan Markle, then a US actress, made a trip there in 2015 – the year before she met husband Prince Harry.

The UK has one of the highest pregnancy drinking rates in the world, at just over 40 per cent.The new study, published in the Preventive Medicine journal, tracked children born in the 1990s until the age of 15.The researchers looked for children with three different signs of FASD, including learning or behavioural developmental problems and physical anomalies such as growth deficiency and distinctive facial features such as a thin upper lip or small eye openings.          Critics said the study used a much lower bar to look for signs that alcohol had impacted a child’s development and vastly overstated the problemResearch leader Dr Cheryl McQuire, of the University of Bristol, said: ‘The results are based on a screening tool, which is not the same as a formal diagnosis. Nevertheless, the high rates of prenatal alcohol use and FASD-relevant symptoms that we found in our study suggest that FASD is likely to be a significant public health concern in the UK.‘Guidance states the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all if you are pregnant, or think you may become pregnant. It is important people are aware of the risks so they can make an informed decision about drinking in pregnancy.’The study’s 17 per cent rate of FASD is well above previous indications pointing to a level of less than 5 per cent.Clare Murphy, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said it would needlessly alarm many women, some of whom are already ‘racked with guilt’ because they drink before they find out they are pregnant. ‘We advise real caution over the interpretation of these findings,’ she said.‘This study, as the authors themselves acknowledge, does not prove any causal link between pregnancy drinking and the developmental outcomes recorded, and may cause pregnant women and parents needless anxiety.’But Dr Christopher Steer, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, praised the study, saying its methodology and the large numbers of subjects involvled ‘add considerable relevance and significance to the findings’. "},{"url":null,"title":"George Amal Clooney set Prince Harry Meghans born childs godparents","story":"    George and Amal Clooney are all but confirmed to be among the lucky godparents of Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s first-born child, DailyMail.com can reveal.

Now, both men are plaintiffs in the lawsuit claiming that GM has done nothing to address the culture of discrimination in the workplace and failed to protect its workers.According to Taylor, who has worked for GM since 1978, expressions of racial hostility at the factory in Toledo were not limited to nooses.\u0027When I’d go to the bathrooms, I saw Nazi symbols on the walls and Hate blacks and Blacks shouldn’t be here,\u0027 he told the paper. In April of last year, Edwards said he was seated at a computer station when a white co-worker walked up to him, informed him that he was in his seat, called him the N-word and then pulled the chair from under him.Both Edwards and Taylor, who witnessed the incident, reported what happened to their union representative and the plant\u0027s human resources, but they say nothing came of their complaint. Silence in the face of their tears: GM chief Mary Barra\u0027s...Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin claims his Twitter account...Share this article    Edwards says he took this photo after discovering the noose hanging above his work station at the plant in March 2017 For Edwards, the alleged lack of action was nothing new: the veteran factory worker said he has endured racial discrimination for years without anyone in management doing anything to stop it. GM has pushed back against Edwards\u0027 version of events, saying it had workers at the Toledo plant undergo anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training following the noose incident last year. \u0027Every day, everyone at General Motors is expected to uphold a set of values that are integral to the fabric of our culture.

There was never a black person who was lynched that didn\u0027t deserve it.\u0027GM officials told the paper  that after the March 2017 noose incident, the company and the workers\u0027 union together produced a memo saying that the automaker has a zero tolerance policy for workplace violence or harassment. The memo was given out to each of the plant\u0027s 1,700 employees.GM said it has taken a host of other steps to ensure that the work environment is \u0027safe, open and inclusive,\u0027 such as training sessions at multiple plants, employee meeting and newsletters.          GM said that discrimination and harassment are unacceptable, and that the company has been conducting training sessions for staffIn March 2018, months before the lawsuit was filed against GM, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission found probable cause that \u0027GM engaged in unlawful discriminatory practices and ordered the company to take immediate action in order to provide its staff with a work environment free of harassment and hostility.A GM spokesperson said the automaker fully cooperated with the commission\u0027s investigation but disagreed with its findings. The lawsuit brought against the car maker seeks monetary compensation for lost wages and mental anguish, and also demands that GM fire employees responsible for creating a hostile work environment as a necessary step in overhauling the workplace culture. The complaint also calls for the company to step up security at the Toledo plant and erase any racist graffiti.   Nooses, Nazis and racist slurs tolerated at GM plant, lawsuit says"},{"url":null,"title":"Jeep unveils Gladiator pickup truck produced road giants 26 years","story":"    The new Gladiator was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday in a spectacular ceremony          Demonstrations during the ceremony showed a doorless version of the car driving over a pile of logs\u0027Unquestionably a truck and instantly recognizable as a Jeep, the all-new 2020 Gladiator is the ultimate vehicle for any outdoor adventure,\u0027 Tim Kuniskis, head of the Jeep Brand in North America, said.\u0027There is tremendous demand for this unique vehicle from our loyal Jeep customers and pickup truck buyers everywhere.\u0027Born from a rich and proud heritage of tough, dependable Jeep trucks, Gladiator combines rugged utility, versatility and functionality resulting in the most capable midsize truck ever.\u0027With its four doors, and a five-foot bed, the Gladiator is 31 inches longer than a four-door Wrangler.

The executive - pictured in 2012 - asked that no photos of the ceremony be made publicMr Carne spent five years overseeing the country’s rail infrastructure on behalf of the Department for Transport.But just before he lined up to meet the Duke of Cambridge yesterday, Britain’s rail watchdog announced it had launched enforcement action against Network Rail, accusing it of failing to do even the basics to operate a reliable service.Revealing train punctuality had fallen to the lowest level for more than 15 years, the Office of Rail and Road said the public body may have breached ‘condition one’ of its network licence with the Government. This requires it to run the railways efficiently and ensure the trains run on time. It is the first time the rail regulator has issued such a rebuke to the network owner in a decade.The watchdog ordered Network Rail to take ‘urgent action’ to address ‘systemic’ failings, which have resulted in months of disruption for passengers.

The overall average price hike is market sensitive and was not disclosed last night.The prospect of more increases has reopened a row between the Government and union bosses, who continue to demand steep pay rises for their members.The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, which has orchestrated crippling strikes across the country, is refusing to ditch the higher measure of RPI of inflation as a starting point for pay negotiations, despite the fact it has been widely discredited.In August, Mr Grayling urged unions to switch to the official CPI measure of inflation, but union bosses have refused to negotiate and instead threatened to stage more protests if pay curbs are imposed.Huw Merriman, a Tory MP and member of the Commons transport committee, said last night: ‘It cannot be right that the rail unions receive a higher wage based on RPI when most passengers, who fund these pay deals, only get pay rises using the lower CPI.‘If the unions are really serious about limiting fare rises, they should accept the same method for setting pay which their passengers are limited to, rather than threatening more strike misery.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Grenfell Tower safely evacuated little seven minutes expert tells inquiry","story":"    The remains of Grenfell Tower (pictured), which claimed the lives of 72 people.

Young Mary married George Merrill.

In March 1941, Doris Sanders married gas station owner Gordon Markle. In 1944, they had a son Thomas Markle – Meghan\u0027s controversial father.Prince Harry shares a connection with Malta.

The UK has one of the highest pregnancy drinking rates in the world, at just over 40 per cent.The new study, published in the Preventive Medicine journal, tracked children born in the 1990s until the age of 15.The researchers looked for children with three different signs of FASD, including learning or behavioural developmental problems and physical anomalies such as growth deficiency and distinctive facial features such as a thin upper lip or small eye openings.          Critics said the study used a much lower bar to look for signs that alcohol had impacted a child’s development and vastly overstated the problemResearch leader Dr Cheryl McQuire, of the University of Bristol, said: ‘The results are based on a screening tool, which is not the same as a formal diagnosis. Nevertheless, the high rates of prenatal alcohol use and FASD-relevant symptoms that we found in our study suggest that FASD is likely to be a significant public health concern in the UK.‘Guidance states the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all if you are pregnant, or think you may become pregnant. It is important people are aware of the risks so they can make an informed decision about drinking in pregnancy.’The study’s 17 per cent rate of FASD is well above previous indications pointing to a level of less than 5 per cent.Clare Murphy, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said it would needlessly alarm many women, some of whom are already ‘racked with guilt’ because they drink before they find out they are pregnant. ‘We advise real caution over the interpretation of these findings,’ she said.‘This study, as the authors themselves acknowledge, does not prove any causal link between pregnancy drinking and the developmental outcomes recorded, and may cause pregnant women and parents needless anxiety.’But Dr Christopher Steer, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, praised the study, saying its methodology and the large numbers of subjects involvled ‘add considerable relevance and significance to the findings’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/02/51D1ED2A00000578-0-image-a-59_1540953650953.jpg","title":"David Attenborough released truly wild album","story":"    David Attenborough (pictured above) recorded the album during filming his Zoo quest series Over recent years, the Christmas No 1 slot has often been taken by X Factor finalists or charity singles.In previous decades, a novelty hit was often the festive bestseller, such as There’s No One Quite Like Grandma in 1980, or Mr Blobby in 1993.This year, there’s perhaps an even more unlikely contender for Christmas No 1 in the album charts — Sir David Attenborough. More astonishing still, Britain’s best- loved broadcaster’s bid involves music performed on a nose flute, a Paraguayan harp and a didgeridoo.It is a double CD of music he recorded during his globe-trotting adventures for the BBC during the Fifties and Sixties, while filming his Zoo Quest series.‘Although the programmes were primarily about animals,’ he says, ‘I always took the chance of recording some of the music on each trip. When I came back, I handed the tapes to the BBC and they’ve been sitting in Broadcasting House ever since.’But these are not rough amateur recordings. Sir David carried a state-of-the-art portable recorder that ran off eight bulky torch batteries: it was cumbersome and heavy and had to be rewound by hand, but produced high-quality sound. The microphone acted as a speaker, too, so that, at the press of a button, he could play back the tape for singers and musicians to hear.Torn to pieces by the pack: Wild dogs rip baboons apart...Lion cubs born in David Attenborough\u0027s Dynasties documentary...Share this articleMany of them had never met white Westerners before, let alone encountered such sophisticated technology, and their reactions were always the same: ‘First bemusement, then huge smiles.’Sir David’s fascination with folk music began in the early Fifties when he learned of the work of U.S. folklorist Alan Lomax, who recorded blues singers in America’s Deep South. As a young TV producer, he invited Lomax to London and record British folk singers for a live TV series called Song Hunter.‘One of our most amazing performers,’ remembers Sir David, ‘was an Irish lady called Margaret Barry who had, Alan said, a very important ballad called She Moves Through The Fair.’ He was entranced by her music and recorded Miss Barry several more times, in London’s Irish pubs with his portable recorder.          Pop star Adele (pictured above) had previously been hailed as having released a strong Christmas albumIt was natural that, for his subsequent job, Sir David would want to take his tape machine with him. For the next nine years, between 1954 and 1963, he travelled the world for Zoo Quest.Now, for the first time, we can hear the remarkable sounds he discovered around the world. Many would have been lost for ever without his tapes: ‘Back then, there were remote places where traditions that had developed over centuries were still continued. They had no knowledge of the Western music that has since enveloped the world.’Among the weird and wonderful instruments that may help Sir David top the charts are . . .          The nose flute (pictured above) is one of the instruments which will be featured on the album Zany xylophoneA sort of xylophone from Sierra Leone, the balange was recorded on the first Zoo Quest series in 1954, accompanied by iron rattles and drums. ‘We were fortunate,’ says Sir David, ‘to find a real virtuoso of the balange, who played a wonderful piece for us.‘I played it back to him. He listened intently, but I could see he wasn’t impressed by Western technology.‘He said that he could quite understand how the machine could record that particular tune, because it was after all pretty simple.‘Now he would play something that would really show whether my metal box could learn a piece of music of real complexity. He played a dazzling piece, full of scales and rapid notes, and then gave me a look as if to say: “What about that, then?”          Stringed bamboo will also feature on the album that was put together on David Attenborough\u0027s travels‘I rewound it and he put the speaker to his ears. I could see his eyes rolling with pleasure — he was very impressed.’The ‘biscuit box’the za-za is another West African instrument, consisting of a tin can or ‘biscuit box’, with ‘struts and strings, and bits of gravel inside. As you play with your thumbs, you shake it up and down to give the rhythm, so one musician creates a very complete sound.’Haunting orchestraThe gamelan is not a single instrument, but an orchestra in Bali, Indonesia — ‘the biggest collection of instrumentalists playing together outside the Western tradition,’ says Sir David. There can be as many as 30 or 40 players, playing gongs or metallophones such as xylophones. ‘They play by memory, with none of the music written down, and they are so dedicated that they will rehearse every night.‘In those days, we heard this haunting music every night in the villages of Bali: energetic and dramatic, full of fire, excitement and thrill.’Funeral guitarA three-stringed instrument carved from wood, like an ornate guitar, the gambus is commonly used at weddings and other occasions in Borneo. Sir David first heard it played in a remote Dyak village: ‘They were an extraordinarily hospitable people who lived in long communal houses, sometimes 100 yards long. They had gongs that they played in a stately and moving way, and the gambus.          Sir David’s final trip for the Quest series took him to Australia’s Northern Territory. In Arnhem Land, he saw an Aboriginal artist from the Burada tribe making a didgeridoo, a sacred instrument‘One night, they seemed to go on much later than ever. Next morning, I asked whether there had been a celebration. It was a funeral, they said — and I discovered I had spent all night beside the body!’Paraguayan harpThe national instrument of the South American country, it had never been heard on British television before Sir David recorded it in 1959.The sound proved popular and was used as the Zoo Quest theme.The harp has between 32 and 46 strings, played with the fingernails. ‘They don’t have any pedals, unlike European harps,’ explains Sir David, ‘so you can make great sweeping runs.’ The CD includes the show’s theme tune, Guira Campana, which translates as The Bell Bird.Nose fluteIn 1963, Sir David and his camera crew received a royal summons from Queen Salote of Tonga to film some of its traditional ceremonies. Her court had an official Custodian of Tradition, who was a virtuoso of the nose flute.This bamboo instrument, the great naturalist explains, ‘is played by holding it up to one of your nostrils and then stopping the other nostril with your thumb. The courtier practised it every evening and sometimes played nose flute chamber music with a group of friends.’Queen Salote also had a resident palace band who played every day. She composed royal music, including a foot-stomping lullaby that would be guaranteed to wake any baby.Turtle callersIn Fiji, priests practise an ancient art known as turtle calling. A deep, slow incantation is reputed to bring the giant reptiles swimming up from the depths — but, when Sir David first heard of the custom, he didn’t believe it was possible.‘The local priest, a shy man, told us he could summon up turtles with a song — and, if he performed it correctly, a huge white shark would follow. I was very sceptical, I must say. He took us up to a cliff, overlooking a bay, where the ocean was a wonderful amethyst blue, and he stood on the cliff and started a chant. And, as he sang it, a turtle suddenly came up to the surface.‘I was still dubious and thought perhaps this was simply a place where there were a lot of turtles.‘It slowly ed down again and, immediately, a large white shark appeared and swam just where the turtle had been. I was impressed!’Further east, on the New Hebrides, now called Vanuatu, the crew became the first to film the custom of land-ing — where youths would hurl themselves off high platforms with just a liana (jungle vine) tied round their ankle to prevent them from breaking their necks.As they prepared to jump, recalls Sir David, ‘the villagers sang to give them courage. It was a Stone Age version of bungee-jumping’.In New Guinea, trekking into the jungle to film birds of paradise, he recorded their team of porters — at least 100 villagers helping to lug the heavy equipment along the trail. ‘Many had not seen Europeans before. The sound of their voices struck me as really quite magical.’Bamboo beatsSir David describes the valiha of Madagascar as ‘a 2ft length of bamboo with strings running along its length and wrapped round it. You play the tube by holding it in front of you like a harp and plucking it with your thumb’.It is the traditional instrument of the Merina people who live in the middle of Madagascar, off the South African coast. Their greatest festival is the day of retournement or The Return: ‘They go to the burial grounds and bring out the corpses of their ancestors that have lain there, some for decades, some for centuries, wrapped in silken shrouds.‘You might think it is a doleful occasion, to be carrying around corpses, but no — they believe their ancestors should be welcomed with joyful music.’Sacred DidgeridooSir David’s final trip for the Quest series took him to Australia’s Northern Territory. In Arnhem Land, he saw an Aboriginal artist from the Burada tribe making a didgeridoo, a sacred instrument.

It was called Yurlunggur, the name of a serpent god. He was the great rainbow snake who emerged out of a waterhole in the Dreamtime, or the time of the Creation.’Later, the BBC team filmed an initiation ceremony, at which young men, their bodies decorated with painted lizards, writhed along the ground and under Yurlunggur.‘Magani blew down it to make the god speak,’ says Sir David. ‘It was very moving and this music takes me back into prehistory.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"World leaders partners arrive Buenos Aires ahead G20","story":"    France\u0027s First Lady Brigitte Macron, 65, French president Emmanuel Macron, 40, Argentina\u0027s president Mauricio Macri, 59, and First Lady Juliana Awada, 44           Theresa May arrived in Buenos Aries early today, descending the plane steps alone as husband Philip opted to stay in the UK          US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrive ahead of the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires          US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump disembark from Air Force One upon arrival in Buenos Aires          Canada\u0027s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau arrive ahead of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires on Thursday          Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) and First Lady Peng Liyuan arrive at the Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires on ThursdayThe long-running dispute over the Falkland Islands - still claimed as Las Malvinas by Argentina, 36 years after the 1982 war - is likely to be discussed in a one-on-one meeting with President Mauricio Macri, but is not thought likely to dominate the talks, which will focus on trade.More awkward for Mrs May could be a potential encounter with  Prince Mohammed, after the UK\u0027s condemnation of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October.Trump prepares to flex diplomatic muscle at Argentina G20...Share this articleAsked whether Mrs May would be willing to shake the Crown Prince\u0027s hand, a senior UK official said the PM believed it was important to \u0027engage\u0027 with Saudi Arabia and would take any opportunity to get across Britain\u0027s message on the need for \u0027full accountability and full transparency\u0027 over the Khashoggi killing and an end to bloodshed in Yemen. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was supposed to arrive in Buenos Aires early on Friday, but her plane returned to Germany on Thursday night due to a technical problem.  Mrs Merkel and German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will resume their travel on Friday, but the long flight time means they will miss the opening of the summit.

O\u0027Neil said she anticipates that to be \u0027quite smooth\u0027 in Mexico and Canada, but passage could be more complicated in the United States after midterm elections flipped the House of Representatives, meaning the next speaker could be Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi.\u0027There are some ... things in there that I think Democrats can support,\u0027 O\u0027Neil said. \u0027But I can\u0027t imagine having a new NAFTA is going to be Pelosi\u0027s first priority when she comes in, so I\u0027d expect it to be drawn out.\u0027It stands to be a short visit for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who is scheduled to return to his country for the inauguration Saturday of his successor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.On Thursday, Mr Macron also criticised protectionist stances by Mr Trump but said they have no plans for a one-on-one at the summit. The two have increasingly clashed in recent weeks on everything from Mr Trump\u0027s nationalism to wine tariffs.

The German military blog Augengeradeaus reported that the plane\u0027s transponder was transmitting the code 7600 which refers to a radio malfunction.Later, the delegation traveled by bus to a hotel in Bonn. Delegation sources said a different government plane would fly Merkel and Scholz to Madrid, where they would switch to a commercial carrier for the final leg of the trip.The delay will complicate Merkel\u0027s schedule at meeting where the G20 members already expect to face very difficult negotiations on myriad issues.Merkel, who had planned bilateral meetings with the presidents of the United States, China, Russia and India, was unlikely to arrive in Buenos Aires until Friday evening, German government sources said. It was not immediately clear which bilateral meetings would have to be rescheduled.Scholz was grounded on the same A340 aircraft last month after an International Monetary Fund meeting in Indonesia, according to German media reports. They said the issue involved damage caused by rodents.                                                    The French president envisions himself as a new leader of the free world and is fashioning himself at this summit as the anti-Trump - a champion of the Paris climate accord, defender of the postwar system of global trade and crusader against multinational tax evaders.Mr Macron warned that Europe might not sign trade deals with the South American regional bloc Mercosur if Brazil\u0027s incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, pulls out of the Paris accord.Taking the world stage at the G20 is a welcome relief for Mr Macron, who has faced mass protests at home over rising fuel taxes that are the biggest challenge yet to his presidency. But his party dominates parliament and neither faces re-election until 2022.Other European leaders at the summit are facing domestic struggles of their own. Mrs May is fighting for political survival as she tries to pull her country out of the European Union. Mrs Merkel is preparing to leave politics after announcing last month she would give up leadership of her party, a post she has held since 2000. Italy\u0027s Giuseppe Conte heads a populist coalition that is clashing with the EU and suffers internal isions.

Consult a psychiatrist? Mount some kind of coup? Maybe invoke the 25th amendment, which was in the process of being ratified when the book was first published and which provides for the removal of a president from office in case of incapacity?It’s a compelling premise, luring the reader through a maze of disorienting what-ifs. But can the dark notion of a clinically insane president be expected to speak to audiences in 2018, a half-century after the book was first published?Kidding! While the name Donald Trump goes unmentioned in the Vintage press materials, the decision to bring the book back into print was blowing in the wind. Earlier this fall, Vintage publisher Anne Messitte saw a cable news spot about the book delivered by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, and the journalist Bob Woodward separately mentioned the book in an interview about Fear, his non-fiction chronicle of the Trump administration.“Not only was I entertained and amused by reading the book for the first time this year – I did not read it in the 60s,” Messitte told the , “I just felt that it was a book that needed to come back into print to be part of the escapism and conversation of our current political moment.“I read it more broadly as an imagined political satire” than a book about Trump, she said. “It’s political fiction, a thriller about what would happen if the government was not functioning the way people expected it to.”Written by the late journalist Fletcher Knebel – “the grandfather of the modern political thriller”, in the appraisal of critic Terry Teachout – Night of Camp David was originally published in the stream of Washington suspense novels that surged after the Cuban missile crisis. Many of those books – Seven Days in May, Fail Safe, Advise and Consent and The President’s Plane Is Missing – became movies that still populate lists of the best cold war thrillers.Night of Camp David was not made into a film, perhaps because the book’s basic premise – “Wouldn’t it be scary if one of the fallible humans in charge of nuclear war went insane?” – had exploded on to the big screen just one year prior, in Doctor Strangelove.Part of the sport of reading Night of Camp David today is measuring the distance between the presidential conduct that freaked out the fictional senator MacVeagh and the conduct of the current White House occupant.It does not detract from, and in fact depending on one’s cast of humor it might add to, the book’s entertainment value to say that Knebel’s imagination of what a dangerously unwell president might act like in private pales in comparison with what Trump does and says for all the world to see.The president in Night of Camp David rants to MacVeagh that he wants federal agents to surveil all US phone calls, wishes to pursue a union with Canada and believes a shadowy cabal is out to get him.“It is sheer folly to have that man anywhere near the command and control machinery,” remarks the defense secretary, Sidney Karper. “It might lead to wholesale murder.”But what would Karper make of Trump? The current president has seen crowds where none exist, deployed troops to answer no threat, attacked national institutions – the military, the justice department, the judiciary, the vote, the rule of law, the press – tried to prosecute his political enemies, elevated bigots, oppressed minorities, praised despots while insulting global allies and wreaked diplomatic havoc from North Korea to Canada.He stays up half the night watching TV and tweeting about it, then wakes up early to tweet some more, in what must be the most remarkable public diary of insecurity, petty vindictiveness, duplicity and scattershot focus by a major head of state in history.(Also, he might be president because of a deal his campaign made with Russia, and he might still be beholden in some secret way to that country.)Present-day concerns about whether the nuclear codes have fallen into the wrong hands are sufficient that the commander of US Strategic Command, General John Hyten, was asked point blank in a November hearing about what he would do if ordered to launch a nuclear strike.“I provide advice to the president,” Hyten said. “He’ll tell me what to do, and if it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen? I’m going to say, ‘Mr President, that’s illegal.’ Guess what he’s going to do? He’s going to say, ‘What would be legal?’ And we’ll come up with options of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that’s the way it works. It’s not that complicated.”It’s not that complicated.It’s a testament to Knebel’s skill that Night of Camp David remains thrilling, even for a reader in Trump’s America. But the question inevitably arises (sorry) as to whether life has surpassed fiction. Consider the fact that while audiences in the 1960s surged to Washington fiction, the bestseller lists today are stacked with non-fiction, from Woodward’s book to Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury to Stormy Daniels’ Full Disclosure to Luke Harding’s Collusion.Messitte said it appeared that readers were picking up Night of Camp David alongside non-fiction books.“We looked at the early pre-sale of Fletcher Knebel, it’s being co-purchased online by people who are really looking for non-fiction,” she said. “So one of the questions we have is, is this a special work of fiction that’s going to cross over and appeal to that non-fiction audience that we know has been so strong.”With Robert Mueller closing in and the president feeling increasingly cornered, there’s no telling what plot twists are to come or how the current tale will end.As MacVeagh tells his wife: “Martha, this is the most frightening thing that’s happened in this country in a long while.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f2c8a6aeee0800abccf0d7b1d523f5cb363072/0_0_1825_1095/master/1825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=683529b60423bfd6c57664a87ce67e3d","title":"brexit britain austerity","story":"“The polls called the referendum wrong” is a common misapprehension. In fact, while they were clearly wrong in the past two general elections, opinion polls were mostly right – at least within a margin of error – all the way through the 2016 referendum campaign. Although most commentators chose to interpret the polls through the prism of their own confirmation bias (what their friends thought would happen), and therefore assumed remain would walk it, the eventual close-run win for leave was fairly well predicted.Latest polling suggests that remain has improved its showing a little – although the net result is still “neck and neck”, too close to call. The problem with most polls, however, is not that they might be wrong but that they mask how polarised British voters’ views have become.Our work at BritainThinks identifies four Brexit tribes, not two, and shows that as much as two-thirds of opinion is clustered at the extremes. We identify the “diehards” who were delighted by the original referendum result, and have few significant concerns about leaving the European Union. At the opposite end of the spectrum sit the “devastated pessimists”, who were extremely disappointed by the result and can see no positives at all in leaving.However, voters are united in their view that Brexit is not going well – although this is driven more by impatience (“why hasn’t it happened already?”) than detailed analysis of the negotiations. Playing the focus‑group game of “If Brexit were an animal, what would it be?”, voters say it is the slowest animal they can think of: a sloth or a tortoise. They are also united – and doubly frustrated – that the Brexit process is distracting politicians from the issues that really matter, and feel far more tangible: the high cost of living, precarious employment, housing shortages, rising crime and, most of all, cuts, especially cuts to the NHS. Some worry out loud that “dragging out” the negotiations is an excuse to insure against these failures.Among the public, there is some anxiety about the prospect of “no deal” but little clarity about what it would mean. Most expect that the current deal (which they struggle to describe) will be rejected by parliament, and are even more concerned about what they assume will be more political turmoil, and continued stasis on the policy areas they regard as priority. They feel that they, the public, have been left out of the discussion, and this may explain a growing public appetite for a further referendum – although there is considerable concern about what the terms of the vote might be.Against the backdrop of ision, Brexit must be seen as a symptom not a cause. It has highlighted deep-rooted inequalities and differences in values that have existed for many years, and for this reason many “diehard” leave voters still believe that the long-term gains of leaving the EU will be worth any short-term pain. Although, as the prime minister has noticed, eight out of 10 say they want to see “the country come together”, it is hard to see how that can happen – wherever the Brexit negotiations and any subsequent votes take us – until those issues are addressed.• Deborah Mattinson is founder director of the research and strategy consultancy BritainThinks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056f6ba71b90c4fd55580dc61331e61f41eb04af/0_146_4717_2832/master/4717.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=539365fa867b5b1665217a2c9a15536a","title":"the joy of not finishing books if you dont like it dont read it","story":"You simply will not read every book in your lifetimeNot enjoying that book you’re reading?Quit. It’s okay. You’re allowed to do it.I can already feel some readers seething with rage at this idea. Lucky for me, this group is now required by their own solemn values to read through the entirety of my argument. They can’t leave if they’re not enjoying it. This whole piece is now a hostage situation.But there’s a reason to my madness.There are a lot of books and we are but mortals. You simply will not read every book in your lifetime. As The Twilight Zone teaches, even if you are the final person on Earth with nothing but time to read, the powerful forces of dramatic irony will ensure your glasses fall to the floor and shatter. We have to accept that when we walk away from this life, we will each leave behind a number of books that, had we ever flicked through their pages, could have had a profound effect on our lives. That’s sad to imagine but it’s a fact of life. It also makes every second you spend wasting your time on a novel that doesn’t grab you entirely unconscionable.I am not saying you shouldn’t persist with a book because it’s difficult at first. Sometimes overcoming that initial struggle is what makes a story beautiful. Slowly a world is unlocked to you as you move from decoding a story to coming along for the ride. That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the moment we all know too well when you’re three hundred pages deep, you’ve tried time and time again to engage with the text and yet you still don’t care in the slightest about these people and their problems.You find yourself flicking to the back of the book over and over again just to calculate how many pages you have left. The pile of books at your bedside table calls to you. But for some reason, you keep struggling on.If it were a film, you’d walk out. If it were a Netflix series, you’d move on and never think on it again. Yet when it’s a book and requires a great deal more time commitment, it’s harder to take out the bookmark and move on.Part of this is the sunk-cost fallacy. When I have already invested so much time into a book walking away suddenly means that time is wasted. So, to avoid this loss, we waste more time and more and more to justify the time we had already spent.Instead, go back to that first moment and remember, you haven’t poured too much time into this book already to quit. You’ve simply poured exactly the right amount of time to realise this book isn’t for you.People don’t like to be defeated by books. We can see there are pages remaining and maybe there is wisdom in those final thoughts that would make the previous weeks entirely justified. Sometimes that is true but it’s very much the exception rather than the rule. Why must we follow something bad all the way to the end on the off-chance it might turn good?At some point it becomes a calculation of ego. When a book is finished it becomes a trophy. When it’s left half-finished it becomes an albatross. It occupies your mind like the tell-tale heart, mocking you, symbolising your failure.But it doesn’t have to be like this. There’s a joy that comes from putting down a book that isn’t working for you. It’s a little expression of freedom and control. It’s like ending a stale relationship. It’s not your fault it didn’t work out. It’s not the book’s fault either. But it’s just not working for you. Sure, it’s sad to say goodbye but you tried and now possibility is once again at your fingertips.Of course this doesn’t hold for all books and all writing. If you are currently sitting in a forklift and the instruction manual just isn’t quite grabbing you, I would still insist that you finish reading it. Same goes for guides to bomb-defusing and books you’re about to be assessed on in your end-of-year exams. The last thing I want is for you to write an essay about just how great this Gatsby guy seems to be, based on the one-third you actually consumed.This is for the books that are holding up traffic. The books that stop you from reading because you can’t bear to face your unfinished project. I’m telling you to let them go. You’ll both be better for it.We are here to fart around and enjoy ourselves not be guilted by books that were more dynamic and exciting when they were still trees. They’ve already lost you. It’s over. Let them go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4afebbbab9079bb0d27fa6b3dc746e7510511730/0_163_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad6b2d3f4ca75a18e2b2cf543ca1baa","title":"zip wire lake district honister pass","story":"The proposal for the Honister Pass has been approved by the park authorities. But profit cannot triumph over beautyThe Honister Pass, from Borrowdale to Buttermere, links the two loveliest places in England. It is a ravine of exquisite ruggedness, a retreat from the crowds of Windermere and Keswick. In the national gallery of scenery, Honister is the Mona Lisa. To whom does this beauty belong? The answer is supposedly to us all, guarded by the Lake District national park. But it is claimed by a company that, it appears, wishes to exploit the existing slate mine at the pass’s summit with a kilometre-long zip wire down one side of it. The structure would be on the slopes of Fleetwith Pike, in the heart of wildest Cumbria, backing on to Pillar and Scafell and looking across to Dale Head and the Cat Bells ridge.The mine’s present owners run it as a successful tourist business, which I admire. Their plan to increase their appeal with a zip wire has been twice rejected by the park authority as harming “the remoteness, tranquillity and wildness” of the pass. The owners, it seems, refused to accept this, and the authority has now caved in and let them go ahead. The only hope lies with the planning minister, James Brokenshire, calling in the decision.In the 1880s a local vicar, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, pleaded with parliament not to allow the same mine to drive a railway up from Derwentwater into the same pass. He said that the owners would “damage irretrievably the health, rest and pleasure of their fellow countrymen, in order that they may put a few more shillings … into their private pockets”. Then, parliament got the point and refused the railway. Will it do so now?In these battles some arguments carry weight and some do not. I love Snowdonia as I do the Lakes, and it too has a sensational 100mph-plus zip wire. But it is at Penrhyn, outside the national park and in an area already devastated by tips and quarries. It does not detract from the surrounding beauty.This cannot be said of Honister, and the park authority’s arguments appear to be meretricious. It would apparently “create jobs”, which is an argument for any development anywhere. Indeed, insofar as Honister has an economic asset – as the Lake District’s defence groups have all pleaded – it is specifically its emptiness and tranquillity. The owners argue that their attraction would bring “younger people” to the Lakes. But youth should not confer privilege in planning decisions. Today’s thrill-seekers are tomorrow’s peace-seekers. Nor do I see any lack of young people on Fleetwith Pike. It is crowded with them. I am sorry if they are not spending enough money at the mine shop, but that is not a planning consideration.The argument over Honister has to be reduced to essentials. It is not about theme parks and Disneyland, any more than it is about preserving something in the famous aspic. The promoters do not want a cafeteria on Hay Stacks, a 4x4 race track round Borrowdale or a casino in Seatoller – or at least not yet. It is specific, whether private profit should override manifest natural beauty. The body specifically set up to guard the latter has switched to the former. Its leaders should surely resign.The wider challenge is clearly to find a new language by which these debates about beauty can be conducted. Failure to do so is leading to the collapse of countryside protection across Britain, outside and now even within national parks. Any and every development is at the mercy of a Whitehall that has reverted to the values of pre-war laissez-faire. The word beauty is dismissed as “subjective” and no longer carries force in planning circles, which is perhaps why auction houses prefer the words “important”, “rare” or “significant”.The beauty of the Lakes, especially the inner lakes around Honister, lies in their seclusion and calm but these are delicate qualities to champion. Their early defenders – Ruskin, Wordsworth, Beatrix Potter and the National Trust – were accused of spoiling them by the mere act of publicising and saving them, and thus drawing visitors. Alfred Wainwright, the Lakes’ most ardent eulogist, and Harry Griffin, the ’s country diarist, attracted millions to the fells over the years. They brought far more “jobs and young” than any zip wire. But to them, these heights were for people on foot, for climbers, walkers and those who wanted to get away from the zip wires of the world. The Lakes were for those who would respect mountains, not crush them with technology.If the case for Honister is lost, I cannot see the legal basis for a national park refusing any money-making application, not least the outrageous eight-lane zip wire recently proposed over Thirlmere. Intended for “high-octane tourists”, this was stopped only after the RAF claimed it might interfere with its low-flying bombers. The issue was not of beauty, but of one desecration being used to override another.Those sitting on Fleetwith Pike and gazing down on Wainwright’s “gravelly shore and heather blooms, and Pillar and Gable’s unfailing watch” are not spoiling the enjoyment of others. Those who would e screaming down a zip wire are doing just that. Anyone wanting to see something similar should visit Switzerland’s Zermatt valley, its summer scenery ruined by zip wire-like ski-lifts everywhere.The alternative is California’s answer to the Lake District, the magnificent Yosemite Valley. Here numbers are controlled, conservation is meticulous and the park authority would rather die than put zip wires down El Capitan. We seem totally philistine. Must we take lessons in landscape beauty from California?To Brokenshire now falls the awesome responsibility of seizing his brief moment in history. The park wants to slash Mona Lisa. Brokenshire must rescue her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af31d9c3a841a7e3c8acbedd71d8711ea14cf0c/0_134_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d764346b40797d74ca2421b7979e653","title":"suspended swansea university academic vehemently denies wrongdoing","story":"Head of management school lodges formal grievance as he is suspended alongside vice-chancellorA senior academic at Swansea University, who has been suspended alongside the vice-chancellor pending the outcome of an internal investigation, has denied any wrongdoing and has lodged a formal grievance against the registrar now in charge of the institution.Prof Marc Clement, dean of the school of management, instructed lawyers to launch the grievance against the registrar and chief operating officer, Andrew Rhodes, who earlier this week informed staff of the investigation and subsequent suspensions.Rhodes, an alumnus of Swansea who joined the university as registrar in April, was previously a senior civil servant working as director general of operations at the Department for Work and Pensions. In line with the university ordinances, the registrar is now acting vice-chancellor.A letter from Clement’s lawyers to members of Swansea University council, seen by the , said their client “vehemently” denied any wrongdoing, was “astounded” by his suspension and would do “all it takes to clear his good name and protect the institution to which he has dedicated a significant proportion of his professional life”. Attached to the letter was a notification of grievance.On Monday, staff and students at the university were informed that an internal investigation had been under way for the past few weeks and as a result the serving vice-chancellor, Prof Richard Davies, in post since 2003, had been suspended while it continued.Clement and two other members of staff from the school of management were also suspended – all on full pay. In a message to staff Rhodes gave no detail about what was being investigated, but said it did not concern the academic performance of the university or its financial wellbeing.The letter from Clement’s lawyers, Capital Law, said there had been no discussion of the allegations with their client prior to his suspension. “Had this occurred, he would have been able to allay the concerns raised. This would have avoided a very public suspension, the significant negative press interest and damage to the reputation of the university and of our client.”It went on: “The allegations appear to have been generated from incomplete, cursory and misleading due diligence. The upshot being that instead of now working for the furtherance of the university’s own interests, our client has been forced to take legal advice to protect his own position.“Our client wishes this matter be resolved as swiftly as possible, not only to limit the damage this may cause to the reputation of all parties involved but also to the vital work he is involved with within the university.”According to reports in Welsh media, members of Swansea University’s medical school have also written to council members expressing their support for both the vice-chancellor and Clement.“Both these men have worked tirelessly over many years to transform Swansea University,” the letter says.“Without them, there would be no school of medicine or the Bay campus. The public spectacle created beggars belief and to see these men treated in this manner brings grave concern for what our university is becoming.”A Swansea University spokesperson declined to make any comment relating to correspondence with council members. “However, we are satisfied that all procedures have been carried out robustly and correctly and in line with the university’s statutes and ordinances.”Under Davies’s leadership, Swansea University has made ambitious progress in recent years, opening a new £450m campus and climbing up the university rankings. It has also been involved in the £1.3bn Swansea Bay City Deal, signed off by Theresa May last year, to fund 11 projects in the area over the next 15 years, in particular a £200m state-of-the-art “wellness and life science village”, a huge regeneration project planned for Llanelli’s Delta Lakes area.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said it was “very unusual but not unprecedented” for a vice-chancellor to be suspended. Four years ago, the Plymouth vice-chancellor Prof Wendy Purcell was suspended pending a review.The Swansea vice-chancellor’s suspension came just weeks after Davies, who earns £252,000 a year, announced plans to retire at the end of the academic year. “This is not the time to reflect on the past,” he commented at the time.“There are more successes and exciting opportunities in the pipeline and, in the fast changing environment of higher education, including Brexit, 12 months is a long period. My focus will be on business as usual which includes, of course, helping to maintain the upward trajectory of the university.”According to Hillman, the climate in universities has changed in recent times, with vice-chancellors under increasing scrutiny from their governing bodies. “Governing bodies are a more important part of the picture than they used to be and have greater responsibilities – and they are beginning to flex their muscles a bit,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24254012d75fda815d40e093a6d4e2bf09e38af1/0_119_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8bf331c5c1310aa05c3abef6bb27bf","title":"china urged lead way efforts save life on earth un","story":"Delegates at UN bioersity conference turn to Beijing to avoid point of no returnChina must play a leading role if the world is to draw up a new and more effective strategy to halt the collapse of life on Earth, according to senior delegates at the close of this week’s UN bioersity conference.With the US absent, Europe distracted and Brazil tilting away from global cooperation, the onus has shifted towards Beijing, the diplomats said after two weeks of slow-moving talks on how to maintain the natural infrastructure on which humanity depends.China will host the next high-level negotiations, in 2020, which will be the most important in more than 10 years. This is the deadline for nations to agree on fresh global targets for the protection and management of forests, rivers, oceans, pollinators and other wildlife.Conservationists hope this “new deal for nature and people” becomes as much of a priority as the Paris climate accord and helps to reverse the current wave of extinction, which is at the highest rate the world has seen since the age of the dinosaurs.Over the coming two years, China should champion the cause of nature as France championed the cause of climate in the run-up to the Paris deal in 2016, urged the diplomats.“China is very important. It can be a great leader,” said Hesiquio Benítez Díaz, Mexico’s director general of international cooperation, who helped organise the previous global bioersity conference. “We’re reaching the point of no return for many species. It’s really bad, but people don’t see this issue.”Rather than leaving bioersity on the fringes, where it has until now been dealt with mostly by politically weak environment ministers and NGOs, he hoped Beijing would use its clout to ensure the subject was high on the agenda of G8 and G20 summits and to press for participation by heads of state in 2020. They also want the issue to be taken up by communities, companies and iniduals.This message was echoed by the executive secretary of the bioersity convention. “We tell China that the bioersity agenda needs a lot of championing,” said Cristiana Paşca Palmer. “They were instrumental in the success of Paris and they can play a very important role.”Until recently, China’s dire pollution problems and woeful record on wildlife conservation meant it would have been an unlikely champion of nature. However, under President Xi Jinping perceptions have started to shift. The government has promoted the concept of “ecological civilisation”, established hundreds of environmental courts and played a positive role in global climate talks.At the conference, Beijing sent mixed messages. It initially ignored a proposal to get involved in preparations with Mexico (the previous host) and Egypt (the host this year), and it remained low-key in Sharm el-Sheikh over the past two weeks of talks. “We were very nervous about their silence,” confided one foreign diplomat.But those familiar with the Chinese delegation said this reflected a difference of approach. Rather than set ambitious public goals, they said the country preferred to set expectations low and work at a higher level behind the scenes. “They are really determined to succeed, but they don’t know how to do it,” said another source.There was recognition that the current global management plan has been a failure: among the 20 Aichi bioersity targets, only one – on the creation of protected areas – is measurably close to being met. Highlighting the low priority that even the host government put on nature, a shop near the conference centre was openly selling an illegal lion hide for $1,500 (£1,170).This convention established a process to draw-up a “Post 2020 Road Map” with more forceful and effective goals. But the political winds are even less favourable than in 2010. Brazil, which played an important role eight years ago, will soon have a far-right government and its diplomats spent much of the time on niggling issues that could have an impact on exploitation of its world-leading bioersity. At one point the conference spent 35 minutes debating whether to be “concerned” or “deeply concerned” about the impact of climate change.A row broke out between developing and developed nations over how to share the economic benefits from genetic sequencing information. Tense negotiations were also needed to set new guidelines for gene drive technology, which can be used to eradicate entire species. Governments stopped short of imposing a moratorium, but built in strong precautions by insisting that no research be allowed without risk assessment , risk management and the consent of any communities who might be affected by the release of modified organisms.Crucially, the delegates struggled to identify what kind of target should be set. There was widespread agreement that bioersity needed a single measurable headline goal – equivalent to the 1.5-2C (34.7-35.6F) in climate negotiations. But there is, as yet, no single metric that can cover the complex interaction of life on Earth. Instead, discussions centred on setting either zero net loss of natural habitat or a broad goal to “bend the curve”, which means reverse bioersity loss worldwide through a series of bottom-up national commitments and wider demarcations of nature reserves, protected areas and traditional or indigenous community land.Pooven Moodley, the executive director of the NGO Natural Justice, said the conference had seen progress in terms of greater recognition of the need for improved environmental rights and more land tenure for indigenous groups. But he said overall the negotiations had failed to take into account the urgency of the crisis. “It does feel like rearranging the deckchairs as the Titanic sinks,” he said.Frustrations were also expressed by Ruth Davis, the deputy director of global programmes at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. “I am used to the UN – its ups and downs – but it’s still disorienting listening to hours of wrangling over single words in obscure documents in empty rooms when this is supposed – quite literally – to be about a plan to save life on Earth,” she tweeted.Despite occasional grumbles, delegates said the situation would be worse without the convention, which at least obliges governments to assess bioersity and report every four years (with the exception of the US, which is the only nation that does not take part). Protected areas – the one concrete target from 2010 – have expanded substantially in the past eight years. Conservation efforts have also helped to pull a few species including whales and mountain gorillas back from the brink of extinction.Pasça Palmer, the UN head of bioersity, said she too wanted more urgency, but she remained optimistic that a deal could be done in 2020. “The best possible outcome would be to have a clear recognition that bioersity is infrastructure affecting life and development. We have to govern in a holistic way, not just one species. And we need to make it clear in people’s minds that without it, we won’t have a healthy planet.”China will have its work cut out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7959caad6a236e63e00bac82b7727afec3f55210/0_237_2002_1200/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb78ea1ce26d0b7a2c85f95c2543716c","title":"matthew mcconaughey ive never done a film thats lived up to what i imagined","story":"The actor’s McConaissance, his rebirth as a grizzled character actor, has won him widespread acclaim. He talks about career wobbles, his work with young offenders – and why he’s never truly satisfied with his workAt this point, the sight of Matthew McConaughey scuffed up and scuzzy, without a tan but with a shirt, is no longer a shock. It has been seven years since the McConaissance that saw the actor stop (or, at least, curb) toplessness to be conciously reborn as a grizzled character actor.But what remains surprising is just how low – or rather high – he is now willing to go. Previous roles of the McConaissance (“I don’t mind the word,” he grins. “It’s got a good metre”) have seen him embrace fried-chicken greased vileness (trailer-trash thriller Killer Joe), pot-bellied greed (mining saga Gold) and life as an emaciated rodeo redneck (Aids drama Dallas Buyers Club). But they have still always been heroes on some level, even if there are a lot of caveats. Underneath it all, they are winners.White Boy Rick is the first time that is not the case. McConaughey’s character – a single father in 1980s Detroit struggling to keep his family together as his son falls deeper into a drug-dealing underworld – sports a jacket so musty you can almost smell it from the stalls. Richard Wershe Sr spearheads a string of schemes predestined to fail. This is a man repeatedly – and convincingly – referred to as a loser.“I didn’t choose to play the loser,” drawls McConaughey amiably in Toronto earlier this autumn. “I played a guy who’s trying to win but doesn’t. You can’t fault him for not being a hustler and a guy with some endurance but he’s ill-equipped, man. He’s living on hopes and dreams of the future but he’s fricking paralysed in the present.”Such empathy with his character is understandable. At some point in the mid-2000s, McConaughey also felt trapped. Smugly flirting his way through a decade of films such as How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Failure to Launch, Fool’s Gold and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past had given him repetitive romcom strain. “The things that were really interesting me, I wasn’t getting offered.” But unlike Welshe, he had the confidence, the agency and the cash to end his stasis.His agent was instructed to send him only glamour-free, small-budgeted scripts. Before long, his mantlepiece was groaning (an Oscar, a Globe, a Gotham, a Screen Actors Guild award for Dallas Buyers Club, an Independent Spirit award for Magic Mike, another for Mud, a New York Critics Circle gong for Bernie, endless nominations – and a few wins – for his existential cop in the first season of True Detective).McConaughey didn’t just prove to the world he could act – or preemptively extend his professional sell-by date. He also managed to nix the notion that People’s Sexiest Man Alive 2005 was a vain clotheshorse. Face to face, he still looks like a matinee-era cowboy, hair and stubble at perfect length, tan intact, shirt buttons more undone than not. This is a guy who definitely still surfs at the weekend. During his comeback, he has been careful to play down those pin-up chops, or at least slather them in unfortunate facial hair – though he is at pains to stress it is not a conscious rejection.“I was not running from anything, I was running to,” he says. At times, McConaughey seems to channel a particularly convincing self-help audiobook. “This is just the next chapter. I didn’t go seeking. I didn’t go: ‘I want roles where I can really transform, I want roles where I can get skinny or fat.’ You look at the character and I go: ‘Well, who is that?’”In getting to grips with such a motley crew, the actor has enormously broadened his brand – and audience. From playing an oiled-up veteran stripper in Steven Soderbergh’s Magic Mike to a closeted, fetish-loving gay reporter in Lee Daniels’ bizarre potboiler The Paperboy, he has embraced a fluidity that happily expands an on-screen sexuality previously wasted with beefcake womanisers. Meanwhile, he has kept a finger in the mainstream via the likes of Sing and Interstellar. Rare is the cinemagoer – multiplex or arthouse, all genders, all sexualities – who doesn’t admire him.He has simultaneously become one of the most prominent Christian actors in Hollywood, expressing passionate gratitude to God when accepting his Oscar (“He’s graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand”), speaking in 2014 about the importance of viewing his marriage “spiritually”, then, two years later, claiming that “mankind has bastardised religion”. Yet he’s also, somehow, a pro at flogging luxury watches, and a creative director for Wild Turkey, the Kentucky bourbon distillery. It’s a slick, nuanced rebrand, a tightrope walk of morality that can make him seem alternative or conservative, depending on the circumstance.His involvement in White Boy Rick is born partly from social conscience. Along with his wife, Camila, with whom he has three children under 11, he set up the Just Keep Livin’ foundation, “dedicated to helping teenage kids lead active lives and make healthy choices to become great men and women”. That means not embarking on the kind of choices made by the real-life Rick, who, after heading deeper into criminality, became the FBI’s youngest-ever informant before heading to jail, where he remains to this day, the longest-serving non-violent juvenile offender in Michigan’s history – which is where McConaughey visited him.“I’ve talked to many people in prison,” he says, “and most of them say they’re innocent. Not him. But he said there have been people who sold a lot more than he did who came in after him and are already out. There are murderers who have come in and got out the math of the sentence does not add up with the crime committed.”Does McConaughey think Wershe’s sentence reflects a system that punishes non-violent drugs offences too harshly? Or was Wershe an exception?“Oh, man,” he says, “I don’t know how equipped I am to answer that. Look: on a personal level, I know and understand that consequences can and do help people decide to take the right path. At the same time, you gotta look at it in a different way and say, ‘Well, let’s look at where is this happening. Who are the repeat offenders? How much are people a victim of what they’ve already inherited and all they know?’”So far, so circumspect. But for a man only a year off 50, McConaughey can seem – as well as look – remarkably youthful. His enthusiasm is puppyish, positivity on full-beam: “I see the bright side of everything,” he says, randomly, at one point. He asks me how old I am.“See, you’re 34 and I’m 49 but I’d still call you ‘sir’,” he laughs. “I find myself doing that still. I have more people that come and want me to share my experiences now than I did before. And I go: ‘Yeah, OK, I guess I’ve been doing this for 26 years. Oh yeah, I’m a father of three. Oh yeah, I do have some experience under my belt.’“In life in general – but also specifically in our business – there’s an initiation process and people don’t just let you in. I didn’t have many people let me in on some things and years later I’m going: ‘Come on, man, you could have just told me that it took me seven years to figure it out!’”McConaughey, a media studies graduate from Austin, Texas, was 23 when he got his breakthrough: he was spotted by Richard Linklater in a TV ad for the local paper. The director cast him in Dazed and Confused in 1992 – a hugely significant and splashy first role – and an enduring cult film. But the road was rocky: his father died during filming and four years of ropy horror and crime procedural TV followed before a followup breakthrough, in the John Grisham adaptation A Time to Kill. While his first film showcased a knack for playing the slacker, his second allowed him to demonstrate a more refined southern charm and courtroom command. Suddenly, there came a flood of scripts – but again, he found himself at sea. “The discernment was a challenge at that point,” he says, drily.There were unusual, often ill-advised choices. Despite his credentials as a leading man, he opted for smaller roles in Steven Spielberg’s Amistad, Robert Zemeckis’s faith-based sci-fi Contact and Linklater’s heist flop The Newton Boys. He regrets passing on Guy Pearce’s role in LA Confidential, and he auditioned for the part of Jack in Titanic and was bereft to lose it to Leonardo DiCaprio.The McConaissance, too, has not been without its blips. In 2015, there was Gus Van Sant’s lethargic, Cannes-booed disaster The Sea of Trees, which was never released in the UK. Gold, the 2016 crime drama, was pure distilled Oscarbait that never saw even the glimmer of an award. The American civil war epic Free State of Jones, from the same year, was a project close to his heart that few audiences cared for last year, the reviled franchise non-starter The Dark Tower came and went.It’s hard not to start wondering what comes after a renaissance. Might it even be time for a new era in his reinvention? After all, he’s the first to admit to consistent career wobbles. The gap between screenplay and finished film is such a gripe he teaches a class of his own creation at the University of Texas called Script to Screen. He won’t name names, he says, but naivety about what can happen to a performance is “absolutely” something that has burned him in the past.“I’ve given this advice: don’t do press junkets or talk about the film until you’ve see it. I’ve done that before and I went and saw the movie and I was like: ‘Every interviewer I’ve talked to must have been thinking, what fricking movie is he talking about?’’You can see why such embarrassment would pique him: this is a man who likes to pride himself on good, old fashioned honesty. “I mean,” he says, stumbling for the first time in our meeting, “I’ve have never been in a film or given a performance that was as good as I’d hoped it would be.” He pauses, carefully and cautiously delivering what feels like a fresh realisation. “I’ve come close. I’ve seen some that are close. The movie that was closest to the script that I’ve ever been a part of is Mud. There was like one scene different and the dialogue is almost exactly what Jeff Nichols wrote.”He’s not being too hard on himself? There’s that Oscar, after all …“Hard enough! I wouldn’t say too hard!”But his forthcoming projects seem, on the face of it, unlikely to offer the opportunity to achieve what he wants. He’s a fisherman seduced by Anne Hathaway in the noirish, yacht-set thriller Serenity then comes Harmony Korine’s comedy The Beach Bum then Toff Guys, Guy Ritchie’s return to the gangster genre.Still, if McConaughey is drifting, he is, at least, cheerful about it. “I’m still getting off on acting,” he says. “I’m not bored at all. Acting is like a working vacation for me. I can’t wait to go to work. I’m scared about it, I love it. I love the adrenaline of it. I’m confident with it. I’m surprised with it. It spooks me in a good way.”He continues evangelising. “I really like the adventure and experience of ing into it. It’s an excavation. It’s a construction. It’s architecture, building something. I’m happy. I look forward to it. I don’t make many films my kids can see yet but I look forward to them one day looking at my stuff and going: ‘Oh, I see what Dad was doing!’”And if anything might spur him back to pre-McConaissance fodder, it’s surely this. “Yeah,” he grins again. “We’re not sitting them down with Killer Joe any time soon.”• White Boy Rick is released on 7 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/247e0ca10790fe32043e11eb88f230553815ae72/553_45_2245_1347/master/2245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c513e451c9d1d9c376f785a07c9a56c9","title":"mowgli legend of the jungle review wendy ide","story":"Originally slated for release in 2016, this Andy Serkis-directed Kipling adaptation was shelved and finally sold to Netflix – it’s getting a limited cinema release just before its launch on the streaming platform – partly to avoid competing with Disney’s live-action remake of The Jungle Book. But I can’t help but suspect that there are other issues at play here, not least the fact that it’s hard to pin down just who its audience is meant to be. There’s rather too much peril and bleeding animal trauma for it to work for a family audience without horrifying younger members. But the association with The Jungle Book means that I can’t imagine adult audiences flocking to see it. It’s a pity, because this is a visually striking, technologically impressive picture.The jungle is a richly realised backdrop, dense with lurking dangers and creeping, crawling biomass. The slight uncanny valley effect of the motion capture performances notwithstanding, the computer generated animals are largely persuasive as both flesh and blood creatures and as characters.

Constantly on the hunt for the next avocado, but never coming close. Yuzu is definitely not the next avocado. Still, it is giving it the college try in that it too is a culinary weathervane with a quirky history, one that tastes nice once you have got your head around it and is absolutely everywhere once you start looking for it.The bare bones: yuzu is a fruit that originated in China, now tends to be grown in Japan and in its raw state is pretty ugly. It looks a bit like a lime that fell off a lorry and in fact tastes a bit like that, too – a sort of sharp hybrid of lime, lemon and grapefruit. It’s not exactly subtle, but juiced and mixed with other things, it certainly has the audacity to go mainstream.I first came across it in Nigel Slater’s 2013 book, Eat: The Little Book of Fast Food, with a sidenote saying it was available in specialist Japanese supermarkets five years later, it comes in four incarnations at Waitrose and as a seasoning at both Sainsbury’s and Tesco.Nobu (the fancy restaurant with all fish and no carbs), celebs and several outposts have been doing magical things with yuzu for ages. It is the (no longer) secret ingredient of Nobu’s footballer’s-wife classic, miso-marinated black cod, and now the restaurant has turned it into a one-bite tart as part of its affordable-for-Nobu festive afternoon tea (£30 with a glass of wine). It’s not the first place you think of come Christmas, but that doesn’t mean they don’t know how to do afternoon tea.The tart is a resounding success, the yuzu custard all zingy and bouncy, and barely set in its case, overshadowing the rest of what is a great tea party, served on china with black tea and snow crab tempura sandwiches. The whole shebang is joyous – each macaroon and cake is shaped into something seasonal such as a tree or a reindeer, which clash comically with the otherwise serious interiors of the restaurant.If you want the full yuzu experience, my advice is to treat it like you would a lemonlimegrapefruit and eat it in something sweet, ideally somewhere Japanese. I tried almost everything yuzu-based I could for the purposes of this column. If you can track it down, Sansu’s yuzu and salty lychee drink manages to not be disgusting, while a small bottle of yuzu juice from Waitrose peps up a green-salad dressing. Despite some heavy Googling, yuzu peel, an Asian staple, eluded me. This is a shame – one of its main uses is added to a bath as a relaxant, presumably for when you have overdone the yuzu.

The clock had ticked on to the hour-mark with PAOK heaving to repel another of the hosts’ attacks when Gary Cahill and Cesc Fàbregas retrieved possession, with the latter slipping Callum Hudson-Odoi free into space down the left.The teenager scuttled forward, Léo Matos backing off further with the forward’s every delicate touch, before effortlessly stroking away an early shot with the inside of his right foot. Both defender and goalkeeper had clearly anticipated the effort being angled towards the far post, only for the ball to fizz inside the near post as a startled Alexandros Paschalakis ed forlornly to his right.Hudson-Odoi has been at this club since the age of eight, his goals propelling dominant youth teams through the system, but this was a first senior reward. His was a broad smile as he slid on his knees into the corner, the England youth international immediately lost beneath a clutter of delighted teammates savouring his success.This was how the Europa League campaign was supposed to be, with homegrown fringe players, academy graduates desperate for a proper chance, showcasing their talent.But, as ever, the praise from the management was more restrained. Maurizio Sarri, a sceptic when it comes to Hudson-Odoi’s defensive qualities, saw him thrive against a PAOK team reduced in number early on and outclassed throughout.“Callum played very well, but the type of match was for his characteristics,” said the Italian. “They were down to 10 men after seven minutes, so we needed only to play in the offensive phase. He’s really very able to do this. But I want to see him in matches where we also need him in the defensive phase.“I don’t know if he is ready, at 18, for the Premier League, especially in a big team. If he was already ready now to make a difference in a team like Chelsea, he would be the best player in Europe in two or three years’ time.” The implication was clearly that the under-17s World Cup winner is still some distance from that level.In truth, a player who had featured for only 35 minutes this season prior to this match had been offered the freedom of the hosts’ left flank, with the Greeks undermined by the dismissal of their experienced centre-half Yevhen Khacheridi, for tripping Olivier Giroud as he ambled on to Matos’s slapdash pass.The standard of the opposition has to be acknowledged when assessing the performances of all Chelsea’s fringe players in a much-changed lineup. But this club still needs moments like this, when Hudson-Odoi torments full-backs, Andreas Christensen is unflustered and authoritative, and Ruben Loftus-Cheek bullying midfield, to fuel the ambition of those in their academy.Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland, watching on from the sidelines, will have enjoyed this being the first time since April 2014, and a Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid, that Chelsea had started four English players in a European game. Loftus-Cheek’s display was also hugely encouraging. His 20 minutes as a substitute against the United States this month represented his only first-team football for three weeks but he glided with menace through feeble opponents throughout, his close control a delight and rasped efforts, brilliantly fingertipped away by Paschalakis at full stretch, serving notice of his quality.Ethan Ampadu, enticed from Exeter City’s academy, also made an impression off the bench, but this occasion also provided evidence of why those talented youth prospects do not gain regular game-time at this club. Sarri had pointed out in the build-up that he has 28 senior players on the books, many senior internationals, all craving regular game-time. At first glance, Giroud, Fàbregas and Ross Barkley all delivered persuasive arguments for inclusion against Fulham on Sunday, with the Frenchman conjuring two fine left-foot finishes to thrust the team into an unassailable lead before the break. The second, a volley at the back post after Fàbregas had arced one of those glorious trademark passes from deep over Pontus Wernbloom, was particularly impressive.Yet, even with players of that calibre controlling the contest, Sarri suggested he would revert to type for Sunday’s derby despite the recent loss at Tottenham still playing on his mind. Had his thinking about his selection against Fulham changed as a result of this match? “No. Because, in the last match, the problem was the team. Not one or two players. So I think if there were two different players, it would have been the same. The big problem was the team.” That may have tempered some of the post-match celebrations but, in truth, they could have done no more. The group has been claimed, with this a rout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/311bcb2e8c442263ff8faa650a2291cabe356810/0_122_3584_2151/master/3584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52dee203a9fa42cbad67d0207991385","title":"liverpool paris st germain champions league","story":"At the end of Liverpool’s defeat in Paris on Wednesday night Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel offered up a weirdly self-referential round of press conferences deep in the bowels of the damp concrete hulk that is the Parc des Princes.First Klopp appeared and said he was not going to single out Neymar for ing or Marco Verratti for a heavy tackle because then people would say he was singling out Neymar and Verratti – all the while still managing to single out Neymar and Verratti.Then Tuchel said he was not going to respond because he knows how these things work and to respond would be to enter into Klopp’s narrative of distraction in defeat. All the while still choosing to enter Klopp’s narrative of distraction in defeat – but only by pointing out that it was, in fact, a narrative of distraction in defeat.Heavy metal passive-aggressive post-modern press conferences. Pull up a chair, media studies students. And all this just to drive some straightforward headlines about a 2-1 loss that owed a lot to Paris Saint-Germain’s craft and intensity, but which also flagged up the snags in Liverpool’s midfield that will be a concern for this evolving team.No doubt Klopp will continue to ponder this in those hours when he is not sitting in front of a piece of cardboard covered in adverts. But there is an issue here, and a point of confusion between method and personnel on nights such as these.Liverpool began with the same flat, muscular Milner-Henderson-Wijnaldum axis that has now started all three away defeats in Europe. It is a midfield that looks perfect for last season’s system, the high-pressing, hard-running game that creates chances out of orderly disorder.Faced with a midfield of greater ball-playing craft, they instead sat deeper and went toe-to-toe in the finer arts, looking at times like a man trying to conduct a concert orchestra with a policeman’s baton. Sometimes you really are better off just hitting someone over the head with it.“Un Victoire Capitale! PSG s’impose sur Liverpool” was the headline in one Paris daily on Thursday morning . And for all the distracting noises about gamesmanship, PSG did impose themselves in that period when the game was won, Verratti, Neymar, Marquinhos and Ángel Di María dominating the ball and playing in a system that flattered their own best attributes.Successful teams are sometimes compared to a fine wine, something that becomes more nuanced with age. This Klopp-era Liverpool have gone further, changing from a bottle of something fizzy and fun and likely to leave you with an exhilarating headache the next day into a thicker, more restrained vintage, lacking a little in the high notes.This is, of course, part of the plan. Klopp has spoken at length about his efforts to create a team that can win by scoring just once rather than playing always in the eye of the hurricane. It may work out. The season is long and attritional.But there is also the danger that a midfield of workers and runners makes sense when your full-backs and front three are tearing around creating potent havoc but less so when there is a requirement to make chances in a more patient, structured fashion. There is also no doubt that they have missed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s dynamism, his more vertical movements with the ball. Philippe Coutinho’s skill and vision in those areas has not been replaced. Naby Keïta will presumably settle. Fabinho seems an unnecessary layer of additional muscle.At the end of which £90m has been spent on re-gearing the midfield for this more measured Klopp team, but it still looks more suited to scrapping and covering behind the old tearaway attack. And yes, quite a lot of this comes back to Jordan Henderson, who played as he always does in Paris: wholeheartedly, retaining his intensity to the last, but fraught with the same limitations.Henderson is a strange player in many ways. He has played 260 games now, been a fixture in the two best Liverpool teams of the last 13 years and been picked and prized by Klopp, Brendan Rodgers, Kenny Dalglish, Gareth Southgate, Roy Hodgson and Fabio Capello. For all that, he remains a player whose qualities are more obvious to those who watch the team from the inside than to those who see just the outline details of match day.Clearly those managers will also see Henderson’s technical limitations. This is a midfielder with one goal in his last 97 games, despite spending a fair amount of each game around the opposition goal. He seems physically unable to turn with the ball in a tight space, meaning every time he takes it with his back to goal he passes backwards, a powerful contrast with most high-class central midfielders, for whom it is an essential skill to take the ball and turn in one movement.In Paris Henderson was bypassed repeatedly in the first half by Neymar, the last with a dismissive veering run that just said, yes, I can move that bit quicker than you.To Henderson’s credit he kept going right to the end, dragging his team along with him, influence growing as time ticked down. But it is not hard to see why Klopp would rather turn the discussion to PSG’s players falling over a lot (which they did) than linger on an unbalanced midfield that seems caught between stick or twist, dogs of the high-press asked to perform a more mannered role against opponents better tailored to the task.Liverpool could still have emerged with a draw. Sadio Mané dropped deep to good effect and bridged the midfield creativity gap at times. Andrew Robertson was fearless as ever. And in mitigation of the midfield effort, Roberto Firmino’s poor form hardly helps. That ability to drop back, hook the ball out of the air, capoeira-style, and find players around him on the turn is a powerful creative weapon. Right now he just looks a little low on zip.There are some positives in defeat. In a way the result simplifies the final act against Napoli two weeks from now. Liverpool will have to win 1–0, or handsomely. This is surely the moment for a tactical reboot of last season’s blitz football, a game to play with fire not ice in the head and in a style that might just leave the midfield looking a little happier in its own clothes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9948455ae9aa22fee22d0976f53a6a5aa3b8d32f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63f19115360c57b5107d6d878d4e5d54","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Liverpool’s problems could worsen in the derby, Ranieri returns to the Bridge and Newcastle fans plan a walk-in protestMaybe the table never lies but it sure can mislead. Perhaps Liverpool are the second-best team in the Premier League at the moment but that does not mean they are very good. So far in the league they have been unbeaten and unconvincing. The main problem is their midfield, which lacks ingenuity and suffers from waning dynamism. Jürgen Klopp has not overhauled it swiftly enough, though at least he has started Xherdan Shaqiri in the last two leagues games to bring more inventiveness. But he deployed Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Gigi Wijnaldum for Wednesday’s lame Champions League defeat in Paris. Henderson is suspended for Sunday’s Merseyside derby so there’s no need for him to be dropped. But there’s a good case for sidelining Wijnaldum and even Milner to go with a midfield trio of Shaqiri, Naby Keïta and Fabinho. That would partly be an expression of faith in the ability of the last two to produce their best form, which has so far eluded them in the early, stop-start days of their careers at Liverpool. Everton, meanwhile, are looking increasingly formidable. If Idrissa Gueye and André Gomes run midfield, as they may well do, then Everton could win at Anfield for the first time this century. PDSpurs have already beaten Chelsea, West Ham, Fulham and Crystal Palace this season so victory over Arsenal on Sunday would make them the unofficial champions of London. Mauricio Pochettino’s side go into the game on the back of a tough Champions League match against Inter Milan, whereas Arsenal’s first team have had a week to prepare. But Christian Eriksen, at least, did not over-exert himself against Inter, having been left on the bench until the 70th minute. If the Dane seems certain to return to Spurs’ starting lineup on Sunday, it will be interesting to see whether Mesut Özil is included in Arsenal’s. Unai Emery has deployed the German wisely this season so that Özil has tended to influence matches when he has played. But if the manager did not think the player would have been able to cope with the “intensity and physicality” of Bournemouth last weekend, it’s difficult to see how he would expect him to thrive against a Spurs who go to the Emirates in ominous form. PDClaudio Ranieri and André Schürrle face the club that first brought the Fulham manager and German forward to London. Ranieri’s Chelsea regime straddled the austerity of the dying embers of the Ken Bates regime and the lottery win of Roman Abramovich initial spending spree. The Italian, who replaced one of his former Blues players in Slavisa Jokanovic, is still popular with Chelsea fans despite now working for their closest geographical rivals and later winning the Premier League with Leicester. He was the first to experience the brutality of an ownership that has sacked eight permanent managers since he was offed in 2004. A decade on, Schürrlefell victim of the club’s stockpiling of talent. Last week, he was a scorer in last week’s 3-2 defeat of Southampton that began Ranieri’s tenure with three pointsbut still betrayed the huge defensive problems the new manager must cure. JBEddie Howe has already acknowledged the task of taking on Manchester City in their own back yard, but his Bournemouth side should take heart from their encounters with the teams above them. They may have lost their last three, but they have not been turned over – far from it – by teams in the top seven. They gave Manchester United a serious fright, drew at home to Everton, conceded late goals at Chelsea and made Arsenal work in defeat last time out. Under Howe in the Premier League, they have earned historic wins over Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and United. But other than last August, when Raheem Sterling clinched victory at the death, City are arguably the only team Bournemouth have yet to truly trouble (in their six top-flight meetings, the aggregate scored reads: Manchester City 21-2 Bournemouth). Howe and his players will be determined to change that. BFThree league wins in a row has lifted the Geordie gloom enveloping a Newcastle team that had seemed destined for real struggle Monday’s win at Burnley leapfrogged them two points and a place above West Ham. That is testament to the continuing ability of Rafa Benítez to wring results from an underpowered squad. The blame for that falls squarely on the broad shoulders of owner Mike Ashley, and fans will be issuing their latest reminder of dissatisfaction with a novel idea for a protest. Rather than boycott the West Ham game, the activist Magpie Group has organised an “11th minute walk-in” to St James’ Park on Saturday, that number signifying the years Ashley has been holding the pursestrings. The aim is to get the tycoon to splash out in January, with fans requested to “have an extra pint before going to the match”, a sacrifice that does not appear particularly onerous. JBHow much longer has Mark Hughes got? Southampton wish to give Hughes time to turn things round but a solitary league win, at a Zaha-less Crystal Palace in September, is telling. This campaign is already eerily reminiscent of last season’s woes and Saints must avoid giving Hughes – who has won three of his 21 league games in charge – too long, a mistake they made by not sacking Mauricio Pellegrino until March. Hughes was impressed by what he felt was an exciting, vibrant performance in defeat at Leicester and suggested he needed to put his energies into some of his younger players, starting at home to Manchester United on Saturday. Danny Ings could return but Michael Obafemi, who made his Republic of Ireland debut this month, was preferred to Charlie Austin and Manolo Gabbiadini on Tuesday, while Yan Valery, the young French defender made his debut. “Maybe that’s the way we need to go,” said Hughes. BFIsaac Success and Kelechi Iheanacho have been pegged as two of the most exciting young forwards around since they formed a partnership that fired Nigeria to the semi-finals of the U-17 World Cup in 2013. Still only 22, neither has yet fulfilled their potential but Iheanacho has generally looked closer to doing so even if he has not developed his game as much as hoped since his move to Leicester. But now Success looks ready to make up for lost time. Finally free of injuries and seemingly more focused, Success has excelled when he has played for Watford this term, convincing the club to secure him to a new contract this week. He is a skilful, clever and destructive runner andmakes things happen nearly every time he gets the ball. After being omitted from the starting lineup for last week’s defeat by Liverpool, Success made a strong impression as a substitute and should return to the first XI at Leicester, where he is likely to make more of an impact than Iheanacho. PDThe sight of Joe Hart with the ball in centre midfield in the closing seconds of their defeat to Newcastle on Monday betrayed Burnley’s desperation. This was panic stations even if the Lancashire club should be used to defeat. That 4-0 victory over Bournemouth on 22 September looks like one of the season’s freak results, and is one of just two wins all season. Failing to beat Crystal Palace would mean they would face Liverpool on Wednesday staring down the barrel of two months without a win. Sean Dyche has admitted “questions will be asked” of him and his team. The main issue is the slackening of the intensity that achieved so much last season. Not that Palace are in much better nick last week’s draw at Manchester United was one of just two points gained since September. Selhurst Park hosts something akin to a race to the bottom. JBAs Glenn Murray continues to do the business for Brighton, his form only exacerbates Chris Hughton’s failure to truly improve his squad. A £60m summer splurge after healthy investment last year has yet to bear fruit. That might be a compliment to the old guard, the likes of Murray, Anthony Knockaert, Beram Kayal and Bruno, but others must step up their game if Brighton are to prosper. Strikers Florin Andone and Jürgen Locadia, signed for a combined £20m, are yet to find the net this season, while Yves Bissouma, a £15m arrival in July has too often looked overwhelmed. Worse still, they are yet to see the real Alireza Jahanbakhsh, their £17m record signing. At least Hughton has recognised as much. “I think it would be fair to say they haven’t hit the levels required yet,” said the Brighton manager, who takes his team to Huddersfield.

I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b79559668f7ad136d222dcd36c15c0b30ec3d6f/0_0_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efee944098ff5f2ca24a81b6ca7be6a6","title":"fir crying out loud share your photos of the worst christmas trees","story":"After the White House caused seasonal smirks with its latest offering, we want to see more seasonal decoration failsLike it or not, Black Friday has come and gone and with December approaching, Christmas is on the horizon.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, sparked anger in the summer by suggesting rail workers should have pay rises tied to the lower rate, should they wish to keep fares lower.Darren Shirley, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Rail passengers have endured enough this year, with botched timetable changes and delays to their journeys which led to the worst punctuality figures for 12 years.“The government should introduce a fares freeze from January. Any future fare increases should be based on the consumer price index rather than an outdated and discredited measure of inflation. Rail travel should be affordable so passengers aren’t left struggling with the cost of their commute.Anthony Smith, the chief executive of watchdog Transport Focus, echoed calls for a fairer, clearer fares formula based on CPI. He said: “Many passengers, still reeling from summer timetable chaos and frustrated by ‘autumn’ disruption, won’t believe fares are going up again.“Passengers now pour over £10bn a year into the rail industry alongside significant government investment, so the rail industry cannot be short of funding. When will this translate into a more reliable railway and better value for money for passengers?”Labour said fares should have been frozen on GTR and Northern, which were particularly affected by the timetabling chaos. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “With fuel duty frozen over the last eight years while bus and rail fares have been allowed to soar, it’s difficult not to conclude that this government is anti-public transport.”Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said: “Nobody wants to pay more to travel, especially those who experienced significant disruption earlier this year. Money from fares is underpinning the improvements to the railway that passengers want and which ultimately help boost the wider economy.”However, rail passengers expressed dismay at the continuing fare rises.Julie Apps, 49, a bookseller who commutes from Dorking to Guildford, said: “My train has been late every time I’ve taken it – and it is often cancelled, often at the last minute and then we can see it run empty through the station.”She said she was planning to buy an annual season ticket, the price of which is going up to £1,620 – even though it would cost her more money as a part-time worker – to avoid the stress of buying a ticket from an unmanned station. “Even though they have put in new ticket machines they break down all the time.”Peter Croasdale, 54, an NHS worker at Guy’s hospital in London, commutes from Preston Park in Brighton to London Bridge on a £3,968 annual season ticket, which is also set to rise by £134 to £4,092. He said: “I think my season ticket is good value considering how often I use the service and how far I travel each week. However, as an NHS worker I have had barely any pay rise in the last eight years and the cost of this ticket has increased way beyond any pay rise I may have received.”Alison Bunce, 44, a video editor, who commutes from Ash Vale to Richmond on South Western, will pay £3,256 in 2019. She said: “Considering the woeful service, the fares are far too high. Every year we are promised that the fare increase will pay for maintenance and so forth, which will mean the service is more reliable. Every year it gets worse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1df82aba115621731b7d9b37541631baa770f9/226_0_4184_2511/master/4184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ce448ea39c267bedab31c7aa1cfa68","title":"clean bandit what is love review underwhelming chart catnip","story":"Clean Bandit began with an undeniable aura of nerdiness. They met at Cambridge, where two members of the original lineup led a string quartet their first hit was called Mozart’s House and merged the composer’s work with a squelchy dance beat. However, the studious trio soon garnered a reputation for being boffins of a different variety: as the Top 10 hits and online streams racked up (to date: nine and 4bn, respectively), it became clear they had masterminded a failsafe formula for churning out chart catnip.In fact, these pop poindexters are so adept at producing standalone hits that releasing an album feels like a formality. This second album has already spawned five singles, including three No 1s. Still, hearing these songs side by side does helpfully expose some of Clean Bandit’s methods. While their 2014 debut, New Eyes, was built around pop-house and string-section flourishes, What Is Love? draws opportunistically on more recent chart trends, namely Latin pop and diluted dancehall. It also sees the band continue their teamwork-based approach to music-making. Each track sports at least one starry guest, be it Demi Lovato or Craig David – something that happens to be a reliable indicator of chart success (collaborations make up around one-third of hit songs).Identifying tangible reasons behind Clean Bandit’s ascent is necessary because their songs aren’t impressive enough to account for their mind-blowing stats. Melodies are frequently forced and characterless, and many songs possess an almost computer-generated quality: either riddled with counterintuitive combinations (Sean Paul singing about the sacrifices of single mothers on mega-hit Rockabye) or resembling other people’s work (the unbearably twee We Were Just Kids is steeped in Ed Sheeran-style nostalgia the lyrics of Out at Night resemble a poor man’s Nice for What). Clearly, the Clean Bandit method still work when it comes to gargantuan sales. But by relying on inidual hits rather than a cohesive artistic vision, their place in the pop firmament may prove more tenuous than it appears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/294680579f671195d182eacee60ab5fa137044d2/1415_566_10589_6353/master/10589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44865c7c8e05fde7b08cd13725ed7776","title":"bowel movement change the way you poo squatty potty toilet","story":"Are you sitting comfortably? Many people are not – and they insist that the way we’ve been going to the toilet is all wrong. By  Alex BlasdelFor their 27th wedding anniversary, the Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston gave his wife, Robin, a gift that promises “to give you the best poop of your life, guaranteed”. The Squatty Potty is a wildly popular seven-inch-high plastic stool, designed by a devout Mormon and her son, which curves around the base of your loo. By propping your feet on it while you crap, you raise your knees above your hips. From this semi-squat position, the centuries-old seated toilet is transformed into something more primordial, like a hole in the ground. The family that makes the Squatty Potty says this posture unfurls your colon and gives your faecal matter a clear run from your gut to the bowl, reducing bloating, constipation and the straining that causes haemorrhoids. Musing about the gift on one of America’s daytime talk shows in 2016, Cranston said: “Elimination is love.”More than 5m Squatty Potties have been sold since they first crept on to the market in 2011. Celebrities such as Sally Field and Jimmy Kimmel have raved about them, and the basketball sensation Stephen Curry put one in every bathroom of his house. “I had, like, a full elimination,” Howard Stern, the celebrity shock jock, said after he first used one, in 2013. “It was unbelievable. I felt empty. I was like, ‘Holy shit.’” The Squatty Potty has been the subject of jokes on Saturday Night Live, and of adulation by the queen of drag queens, RuPaul. This January, after Squatty Potty LLC hit $33m in annual revenues, the business channel CNBC, which helped bring the footstool to fame through its US version of Dragon’s Den, hailed the device as a “cult juggernaut”.The Squatty Potty’s success is partly down to “This Unicorn Changed the Way I Poop”, an online ad that launched in October 2015 and has since been viewed more than 100m times. In the video, a fey cartoon unicorn, its rear hooves perched upon a Squatty Potty, Mr-Whippies rainbow-coloured soft-serve ice-cream out of its butt and into cake cones while an Elizabethan Prince Charming details the benefits of squatting to poop. (“I scream, you scream, and plop, plop baby!”) At the end of the video, the prince serves the ice-cream to a gaggle of kids. (“How does it taste, is that delicious? Is that the best thing you’ve ever had in your life?”)At first, many people saw the footstool as little more than a joke Christmas present. But, like fresh bed linen and French bulldogs, the Squatty Potty exerts a powerful emotional force on its owners. “I have one and I have to tell you, it will ruin your life,” a Reddit user called chamburgers recently posted. “I can’t poop anywhere but at home with my Squatty Potty. When I have to poop at work I’m left unsatisfied. It’s like climbing into a wet sleeping bag.” Bobby Edwards, who invented the footstool with his mom, calls people like this “evangelists”. “They talk about it at dinner parties, they talk about whenever they can – about how the Squatty Potty has changed their life,” he told me. He sounded almost mystified.The popularity of the Squatty Potty, and the existence of its many rivals and imitators, is one of the clearest signs of an anxiety that’s been growing in the west for the past decade: that we have been “pooping all wrong”. In recent years, some version of that phrase has headlined articles from outlets as erse as Men’s Health, Jezebel, the Cleveland Clinic medical centre and even Bon Appétit. By giving up the natural squatting posture bequeathed to us by evolution and taking up our berths on the porcelain throne, the proposition goes, we have summoned a plague of bowel trouble. Untold millions suffer from haemorrhoids – in the US alone, some estimates run to 125 million – and millions more have related conditions such as colonic inflammation.Where illness goes, big business follows. The markets for treating these ailments – with creams, surgery and haemorrhoid doughnut cushions – are worth many billions of dollars. Although diet is widely believed to be a contributing factor in these problems (eat your fibre!), lately attention has focused on the possible effects of toilet posture. The renowned Mayo clinic is now conducting a randomised controlled trial to see whether the Squatty Potty can ease chronic constipation, which afflicts some 50 million Americans, most of them women, many over 45 years old.People often say pooping is taboo, but lately it seems more like a cultural fetish. There are poop emoji birthday parties for three-year-olds, people WhatsApping photos of their ordure to friends, TripAdvisor threads on how to avoid or avail yourself of squat toilets. Through the miracle of online media, you can now discover that, in the past year, both Brisbane, Australia and Colorado Springs, Colorado, suffered reigns of terror by mystery “pooping joggers” who ran around crapping on people’s lawns. There’s a whole YouTube subculture devoted to infiltrating restrooms with vintage toilets and surreptitiously flushing them over and over again (one of these channels has more than 16m views). The renowned novelist Karl Ove Knausgaard has devoted passage after passage to his bowel movements. You can even read opinion pieces about the pleasures of evacuating in the nude.But it’s the banal Squatty Potty that’s doing the most to change not just how people discuss poop, but how they actually do it. “It’s piercing that final veil around bodily use and bodily functions,” Barbara Penner, professor of architectural humanities at UCL’s Bartlett School of Architecture, and one of the preeminent scholars of the modern bathroom, told me. Perhaps it’s because this small, unlovely stool embodies a grand ambition: to upend two centuries of western orthodoxy about going to the loo.Shitting, like death, is a great leveller. It renders beluga caviar indistinguishable from tinned ham, a duchess as creaturely as a dog. Even God’s only son may be transformed by the act: the stercoranistes, an early Christian sect, believed in a double transubstantiation, Christ into the communion wafer, and thence into dung. Though at different times and places the excrement of certain personages – be they the Dalai Lama or those with “healthy” gut biomes – has been revered for its healing powers, shit itself is a strict egalitarian. Faecal-borne disease knows no kings cholera can kill anyone.People have long tried to resist the democratic power of defecation, imposing rigorous distinctions on and through the act. Since at least the 19th century, bathrooms have been arenas of racial and gender oppression, from the Jim Crow south to the era of trans rights. Hinduism is infamous for its caste system, according to which the Dalits, formerly known as “untouchables”, are forced to manually dispose of the faeces of higher castes. In Kenya, the nomadic Samburu use personal trowels to cover their excrement the beading on the handle expresses the owner’s status within the tribe. In the US and UK, the bathroom is often, per square foot, the most expensive room in the home. Wedgwood, who made your posh grandmother’s dinner set, made her posh grandmother’s toilet pan.The recorded history of human defecation can be read as a series of attempts at differentiation: how do we separate our excrement from our bodies, our sewage from our homes and cities? How do we keep the sounds and smells of our bodily functions from infesting other people’s senses? How do we enforce social hierarchies by iding the bodies of the powerful from the bodies of the oppressed?To these questions, the bathroom with its seated water closet, or flush toilet, was a surprisingly recent but remarkably potent answer. Though sit-down privies and latrines have existed at least since Egyptian antiquity, for almost all of history the vast majority of Homo sapiens defecated squatting, in the open. As the planet filled up and humans clustered together in cities over the second half of the previous millennium, open defecation became a scourge, leading to rising rates of diseases such as dysentery – still a major problem in parts of the world without modern sanitation.It’s generally held that the water closet was invented by an English nobleman at the end of the 16th century. But it wasn’t until the the industrialisation of Britain’s potteries and ironworks in the mid-19th century that water closets ceased to be the preserve of the wealthy. As they spread to homes across northern Europe, toilets led to revolutions in sanitation, medicine, social relations and even psychology.With more and more people going to the bathroom at home and in private, defecation became a solitary and almost unspeakably vulgar act. Some wrongly believe that other people’s bowel movements elicit universal disgust. But as recently as the 16th century, a treatise on etiquette scolded well-to-do Europeans not to flaunt the stinking cloth with which one wipes one’s arse. For several hundred years, into the 18th century, English monarchs did their business in front of literal privy councils while enthroned upon an upholstered box containing a chamber pot. Indeed, “social defecation” has been observed across times and cultures. In the 1970s, the anthropologist Philippe Descola documented it among the previously uncontacted Achuar people in the Amazon open-plan, ni-hao (“hello”) bathrooms are still common in many parts of China.In the period of late empire in which it was popularised, the private toilet and bathroom came to be seen as the sine qua non of European achievement. “The Civilisation of a People can be measured by their domestic and Sanitary appliances,” the pioneering Victorian sanitary engineer George Jennings wrote in the 1850s. It’s a sentiment still shared by many a bewildered western tourist when first confronted in parts unknown by what appears to them to be a tiled hole in the ground.So profound is the link between the water closet and people’s vision of the modern west that the German architect Hermann Muthesius predicted in 1904 that “when all the fashions that parade as modern movements in art have passed away,” the bathroom, with its beautifully functional fixtures, would be “regarded as the most eloquent expression of our age.” Edward Weston, one of the fathers of artistic modernism, agreed. After spending two weeks in the autumn of 1925 photographing his toilet, he pronounced its “swelling, sweeping, forward movement of finely progressing contours” a rival to the most celebrated sculpture of so-called western civilisation, the Winged Victory of Samothrace.Like any technological solution, however, the water closet set in motion new problems. The use of water to dispose of faeces has been “a central element of our perilous fantasy that the planet was created for human convenience,” one Canadian scholar has written. Alongside improved hygiene and stronger taboos also came an explosion in various so-called “modern” diseases, such as haemorrhoids and constipation, which were attributed to seated toilets. One 20th-century physiotherapist described constipation as “the greatest physical vice of the white race”.Antidotes, such as low-to-the-ground toilets known as “health closets”, which would allow for a half-squat position, have been on the market in Britain since at least the 1920s, Barbara Penner notes in her book Bathroom. Around mid-century, a predecessor of the Squatty Potty was on sale at Harrods. In the mid-1960s, in the US, a Cornell University architecture professor named Alexander Kira proposed a number of squatting and semi-squatting toilet designs in his monumental study The Bathroom, in which he called the seated toilet “the most ill-suited fixture ever designed”. Yet no solution to the problems posed by the modern toilet really took off. Until now.The most primitive things sometimes require extraordinary sophistication to produce. The passage of a humble turd demands the orchestration of the sympathetic and parasympathetic isions of the autonomic nervous system, muscles skeletal and smooth, three anal reflexes, two sphincters and a weight of cultural knowledge about where and when it’s appropriate to go. It is a “masterful performance”, writes the German scientist Giulia Enders in her international bestseller, Gut.On its descent through our bodies, faecal matter traverses a landscape marked by the poetry of the gastroenterologist: the flaps of tissue that project into the rectum, known as the “valves of Houston” the bouquet of blood vessels contained in the “anal crypt”. As the rectum fills with the products of digestion, it signals, through nerves running into the sacral region of the spinal cord, that defecation may be necessary. The internal and external anal sphincters then begin a culturally mediated pas de deux, the former pressing for release and the latter restricting discharge until the opportune moment.But to perform this act on a seated toilet, which can range from a standard 13 or 14 inches tall to a “comfort height” of as much as 20 inches, more than doubled that time. Imagine that your bowels are a prison revolt, and the inmates – your faeces – are trying to storm the gates. If they have to take a hard corner, they’re going to lose momentum and get trapped. With a straight shot, they can easily come pounding down the door. When we sit to defecate, we need to force our feces through a bend in our rectum created by a little hammock-shaped muscle called the puborectalis. While standing or sitting, the puborectalis helps to keep us continent by cinching our bowel closed. In a full squat, that cinch relaxes, the bend or “anorectal angle” opens up, and intra-abdominal pressure rises, reducing the need to push.This is an eminently good thing. Straining to force your crap around the puborectalis can induce haemorrhoids, intestinal inflammation, fainting – even strokes, brain haemorrhaging and heart attack. One theory has it that the pain from a thrombosed haemorrhoid was so distracting that it cost Napoleon the battle of Waterloo. Elvis Presley’s personal physician famously speculated that a cardiac arrest brought on by straining is what finally did the King in. The kink in your tail may also give you a backlog of faeces that’s not able to leave the gut on schedule. This “faecal stagnation” is thought to be a factor in colon cancer, appendicitis and inflammatory bowel disease. It’s estimated that the average adult produces over 300 pounds of faeces in a year legend wrongly but tellingly has it that John Wayne died with 40 pounds, or more than a month’s worth, of crap in his gut, and Elvis with something like 60.The Squatty Potty was born in similarly unfortunate circumstances. “I was constipated my whole life,” Judy Edwards, the Squatty Potty co-creator, admitted in 2016. For a long time, she had been using a little footstool in the bathroom. “We’d teased her about it for years, about this stupid poop stool she’d bring on vacation,” her son Bobby told me. But the footstool wasn’t quite right, so one day, after Bobby, who was working as a building contractor, started taking design classes, Judy asked him to take a look at it. “She took me to the bathroom and she showed me how it worked, and as she was sitting there explaining it to me, it’s like a light went on in my head,” Bobby said.With paint cans and phone books, they determined the perfect height and width for a new stool. The template Bobby created became the design of the first Squatty Potty. “It was hilarious,” Bobby said. “I thought, this is brilliant, I can picture the infomercial now.” The Edwardses began manufacturing the first Squatty Potties in their garage in 2010.People’s reluctance to embrace the Squatty Potty wasn’t helped by the fact that the Edwardses promoted it at the local trade show with a skeleton on a toilet. (Although the Squatty Potty itself is designed to be as discreet as possible – the standard, white plastic version almost blends away into the colourless expanse of many modern bathrooms – the marketing could never afford to be minimalist.) But friends and family to whom the Edwardses had gifted Squatty Potties where pleasantly surprised by the stools, so Bobby and Judy carried on. St George might not have been ready for the Squatty Potty, but it was about to make a bigger splash than they could ever have imagined.One of the dizzying ironies of our time is that an earlier reverence for the trappings of civilisation seems to be giving way to a pervasive distrust of modern habits and modern technology. Cars have ruined cities, atomised people and poisoned the atmosphere. Plastics have poisoned the seas. Deodorants and air fresheners have poisoned us. Antibacterial soap has led to the rise of superbugs. Your chair is killing you. So are your running shoes. If you listen to Jared Diamond or Yuval Noah Harari, the development of agricultural civilisation may be the gravest mistake humans ever made. For vigour and vitality, you should renounce thousands of years of grain-based eating and return to a paleolithic diet.We have even come to look upon the toilet with a jaundiced eye. As a result, there’s something beguiling about the suggestion that the Squatty Potty, for the few moments we mount it, allows us to return to a more natural state. “It’s all about basic mechanics,” Bobby Edwards told an interviewer in 2014. “It’s about taking it back to the way it was done thousands of years ago.”But for all its squat-like-our-ancestors logic, it’s no surprise that the rise of the Squatty Potty tracks the spread of social media. The vogue for lifestyles that are cleaner, greener, more organic, paleo, supposedly more in tune with human evolution, and closer to nature has largely spread through hi-tech means. (To a dieter’s exasperation, there seem to be more paleo apps than paleo-conforming appetisers.) One of Squatty Potty’s earliest significant sales boosts came in 2011, from a vegan blogger with 75,000 followers. It has also been lauded by influential blogs and websites such as The Paleo Mom, Wellness Mama and the Mother Nature Network.It’s a commonplace that social media such as Instagram pressure us to present perfect versions of ourselves: here we are, beautiful and happy, living our best lives #blessed. Like the earlier craze for colonics, the fad for clean eating and the mania for mindfulness, the Squatty Potty seems to translate this perfectionism to our internal states. “The Squatty Potty almost turns the body itself into this efficient flushing mechanism,” like the complex sewage systems we’ve constructed, Barbara Penner said. “There is this element of ‘Let’s empty ourselves out’.” The implicit notion seems to be that ridding ourselves of “bad” foods, unthoughtful thoughts and every last pellet of faeces can help us achieve not only health, but something approaching a state of purity.At the same time, social media has had other, more humanising effects. In the 1970s, Alexander Kira of Cornell University diagnosed Americans with a psychological and cultural aversion to squatting, as well as to talking openly about our basest bodily functions. Today, after little more than a generation, people are opening up about defecation in a way that was presaged by early, faeces-focused social media sites such as poopreport and ratemypoo. These sites were often anonymous and almost completely free from the cultural censors that ran traditional media. By contrast, today people happily put their names to stories about their bowel movements, and you can read about anal fissures in the pages of the New York Times.This unabashed attitude is a major part of the Squatty Potty’s appeal, too. By combining the science of the puborectalis with the whimsy of crapping unicorns (and, in a later ad, gold-bullion pooping dragons), the company is trying to transform the private indignity of awkward bowel movements into an almost universally shared joy. “If you’re a human who poops from your butt,” this stool’s for you, the prince in the unicorn video avers. People were listening: in the three months after the video aired, the company sold 195,000 footstools, and grossed more than $7m.The Squatty Potty website features a nearly endless feed of Instagram testimonials for its products, which now include a nine-inch version, a bamboo version, a kids’ version that looks like a hippopotamus, stools in black, grey and pink, and a host of other faeces-related goodies, such as witchhazel-infused foam that turns standard-issue toilet paper into flushable wet wipes and a plunger shaped like the poop emoji. New footstools are shipped with a pin-on badge that reads “I POOPED TODAY!”But this sudden enthusiasm for disclosing private habits masks a deeper truth: shitting and shit have never stopped being profoundly public. Behind the closed door of the bathroom have always lurked the public structures – the pipes, the laws, the labour – that manage human waste. And, behind those, lie defecation’s two inescapable conditions: our bodies and the planet.There’s a set of common fallacies that equate the “natural”, the “healthy” and the “good”. We often decide that something we think is good must also be healthy (that morning cup of coffee or nightly glass of red wine, say) or natural (polyamory for some, religion for others). But we also like to run things in the opposite direction: if we believe something is natural, whatever that means, we often assume it must also be healthy and good. Our caveman ancestors, in their wise state of nature, ate nothing but acorns and barbecued mammoth? Me eat nut butter and grass-fed steak!Squatting may be natural, but the question remains: is the Squatty Potty also good? Post Darwin, we no longer tend to believe a couple of hundred or thousand years of human ingenuity can improve upon the immemorial march of evolution. Those who think the water closet has been vindicated by history ignore how contingent, and in some ways irrational, modern sewage systems with seated toilets really are. This is underscored by the fact that billions of people regularly use modern, hygienic squat toilets to poop.So it does seem plausible that the Squatty Potty might return us to a sort of pooping Eden. But the limited research that exists on footstools is equivocal. In three studies that were either uncontrolled or had very small sample sizes, there was evidence that squatting to defecate has positive effects on the ease and extent of elimination. When it came to simulating a squat by using a footstool, though, the results were inconclusive. The semi-squat position did not appear to open the anorectal angle, or reduce the amount of straining needed to go, though the studies were not rigorous enough to establish anything approaching a scientific fact.That doesn’t mean you need to hit the squat toilets that still exist along the French motorway or – to the horror of the Daily Mail – in Rochdale’s Exchange shopping mall. Dr Adil Bharucha, who is leading the Mayo clinic’s randomised controlled trial of the Squatty Potty, hopes that his study will establish more conclusively whether the Squatty Potty works, and why.Of course, even if it does cut down on haemorrhoids and constipation for many people, this doesn’t make the Squatty Potty natural. Rather, the stool shows it’s actually impossible to go “back.” “We are locked into these systems and patterns of use,” Barbara Penner said. “But the Squatty Potty intervenes into that system and modifies it without actually requiring a massive retrofitting of the system.” (One Reddit user suggests crapping in 10-inch stiletto heels.) It’s also pleasantly low-tech, something of a riposte to wifi-connected toilets that heat your bum cheeks and analyse your urine for you – and whoever else has access to the data.The philosopher Slavoj Žižek has claimed to discern in the toilet designs of Germany, France and England basic ideological differences between Europe’s three principal cultures. Germany’s “lay and display” toilets, which allow excrement to rest on an exposed shelf for inspection before being suctioned away, reveal a blend of conservatism and contemplativeness. French toilets, designed to remove faecal matter as swiftly as possible, express that people’s revolutionary hastiness. Anglo toilets reflect a pragmatic medium: according to Žižek, “the toilet basin is full of water, so that the shit floats in it, visible, but not to be inspected”.If the Squatty Potty expresses a worldview, it may be an almost evangelical one: a yearning to purify and perfect ourselves, to be saved from the messiness of this world. Part of the fantasy of the Squatty Potty, Penner pointed out, is that it will completely separate our faeces from our bodies the way sewerage purports to separate it completely from our lives. (Bobby Edwards says his hope was simply to create a successful business, and to help people.)It’s tempting to read into this lust for evacuation an anxiety about our current age, when our rejectamenta of various kinds are bearing back down on us from all sides. We are now realising that there is no “away” to which we can flush our excrement it is always coming back to us in some form, be it faecal bacteria in seafoam, or the hundreds of thousands of pounds of human excrement that climbers have left on the slopes of Denali, north America’s highest, and among its wildest, peaks. The complete evacuation of faeces from our bodies and our world is a chimera.But the Squatty Potty also represents a more worldly sort of devotion. Our anal sphincters “are concerned with some of the most basic questions of human existence,” Giulia Enders, the scientist, writes: how we navigate the boundaries between our internal and external worlds. One might add the spiritual world, too. The simple hedonism of a full bowel movement reminds us that the body is the ultimate seat of the soul. Like Bryan Cranston, we all want the ecstacy of elimination, the self-love we feel after a really good shit.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958318722b74ee8906d91347a16a0801409eb58d/611_150_3358_2360/master/3358.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37115eb5384f0d4cfe38951f19dfe725 700w","title":"second referendum campaigners split over parliamentary tactics","story":"‘It’s like world war three’ says People’s Vote source, with Tory MP pushed to drop amendmentA row has broken out among campaigners for a second referendum about when to push the issue to a vote in parliament, with the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston resisting pressure not to table her amendment demanding a “people’s vote”.With the Labour leadership withholding its support, some campaigners fear forcing the issue to a vote on 11 December would undermine their cause.They believe once it has been shown that there is no majority for a second referendum – and achieving one is likely to be impossible without Labour backing – it will be difficult to return to the question again if May’s deal is rejected.Wollaston said she remained a “passionate supporter” of a people’s vote, but would wait until after the weekend before deciding whether she would table her “doctors’ amendment”.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.“We are listening to concerns that are being put to us, that it would fail badly, and that might be used as an excuse,” she said. Some MPs fear the government could then say parliament had definitively rejected a second referendum.“The reality is that it can’t succeed unless the Labour frontbench support it. Genuinely there are two schools of support here about whether it’s a good thing to keep the pressure on,” she said, adding: “It’s a strategy question.”However, one senior member of the People’s Vote campaign claimed Wollaston was being “sat on”, and there had been a bitter row about the best way to proceed. “It’s like world war three,” he said.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are drafting their own amendment on a people’s vote, as an “insurance”, in case Wollaston decides to hold back.The government’s announcement that it will accept amendments to the motion approving May’s Brexit deal – with up to six to be voted on, before the deal itself – has sparked a scramble to decide which questions to press.The Brexit select committee chair, Hilary Benn, laid down his own cross-party amendment on Thursday, signed by other chairs including Rachel Reeves and Dominic Grieve. It aims to show that the House of Commons rejects the idea of a no-deal Brexit – and allow MPs to take control of the next steps if the deal falls.Labour is likely to back the amendment, with the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, repeatedly insisting he wants to take a no-deal outcome off the table.Meanwhile, the Conservative former minister Jo Johnson warned on Thursday that May’s Brexit deal could lead to electoral Armageddon for his party.In his first major speech since resigning as a transport minister earlier this month, Johnson joined David Willetts and Justine Greening to sketch out a future in which the party faced an existential crisis and would have its brand thrashed by the economic fallout from Brexit.Johnson described the package their party leader had agreed with the EU as a “botched deal” that would put British firms at a competitive disadvantage and fail the services sector, which he said had been “scandalously” neglected during negotiations on Brexit.He added: “Brexit is seen as a project driven by the Conservative party, and this half-baked, worst of all worlds Brexit could trigger an electoral defeat on the scale of 1997, or worse, with this ‘Tory Brexit’ label an albatross around our necks for years to come.”Such an outcome would “roll out the red carpet for Jeremy Corbyn” and lead to “communist ideologues” coming to power in Britain.Sketching out a plan for another referendum that would take place by the end of May 2019, Greening said article 50 could be extended by another four months.The former education secretary said she was backing a second referendum because the country was tired of what she described as “backroom deals”. She said it was incredible to see May “touring the country and talking to people who she did not want to give a vote to”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5cd981773d6f2fc4d514c856e7695484b26afe/0_1_2047_1228/master/2047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901e32faf336771a97fa8e43e30b2559","title":"theresa may rules out norway style brexit compromise with labour","story":"En route to the G20, PM rejects plan B and accuses Labour of wanting to leave country with no dealTheresa May has ruled out any plan B involving a Norway-style compromise deal with the Labour party in order to deliver a parliamentary consensus on Brexit, saying the opposition party’s refusal to accept the backstop arrangement put the UK on a course for no deal.Influential backbenchers, including former Tory minister Nick Boles and Labour’s Stephen Kinnock, have been developing a compromise proposal based on membership of the European Economic Area plus a negotiated customs union, believing it is the only version of Brexit that could attract enough Labour and Tory votes to deliver a parliamentary majority.Some cabinet ministers are understood to be attracted to the plans as an alternative if May’s negotiated deal fails to pass the House of Commons.However, on Thursday May repeated her rejection of the “Norway plus” model and suggested she would not be prepared to offer it as a compromise arrangement because it would mean the continuation of freedom of movement. That is regarded in Downing Street as the hardest of the prime minister’s red lines.Speaking to reporters en route to the G20 summit in Argentina, the prime minister remained defiant that her version of a Brexit deal could win the vote in less than a fortnight’s time. More than 90 Conservatives and the overwhelming majority of the Labour MPs have publicly confirmed they will not back it.“I’ve been very clear about my position, we won’t be in the customs union,” she said, onboard her RAF Voyager plane to the two-day summit in Buenos Aires.“What you see in the political declaration is what would be a deal for the United Kingdom that is not Norway, it is not Canada, it is a more ambitious free trade agreement than Canada, and it ends free movement – which Norway doesn’t do.”Asked whether the model would be the only way to win Labour votes, the prime minister suggested the end result of the strategy put forward by shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer would be the UK leaving with no deal.“You talk about if a Norway-style strategy would bring Labour along with it – if you look at the Labour party amendment that they’ve put down to the motion on the 11th of December, actually what they are doing is advocating rejecting the deal we’ve negotiated with the European Union without having any proper alternative to it,” she said.“They say they don’t want no deal, but by appearing to reject a temporary backstop, they are effectively advocating no deal. Without a backstop, there is no deal.”May suggested she believed there was no compromise that could involve Labour. “What they actually want to see is another general election,” she said. “And that means they are not acting in the national interest, they are putting their narrow party interest first.”The prime minister insisted the result of a vote was not a foregone conclusion despite her mutinous backbenchers’ stated intentions. “Everyone said we would not get a deal, and now we’re in the position of having a deal, all you seem to want to be asking about is the next stage,” she told reporters. “We haven’t had the vote yet. Let’s focus.”May suggested those MPs who had sworn to vote down her deal were going against the interests of their constituents. “I ask every member of parliament to think about delivering on the Brexit vote and doing it in a way that is in the interests of their constituents – because it protects the jobs and livelihoods of their constituents.“If the vote is not supported then we will see more ision and more uncertainty. A ided country is not a country that prospers.”Speaking at the liaison committee of MPs before she set off for Buenos Aires, May was pressed on whether she had a plan B for avoiding a no-deal scenario and the dire economic consequences the Bank of England has predicted.May suggested the result of rejection would be a ramping up of preparations for no deal. She later told reporters that loss of the government in parliament would set in motion “practical preparations that they would need to make for a no deal” to mitigate the worst-case scenario.“The point of the preparations ... is to ensure that we can take action to mitigate the impact of no deal,” she said. “We are doing what every sensible government would do.”Speaking about the upcoming TV debate, May said she would debate only Jeremy Corbyn and not any hard Brexiter such as Boris Johnson, or any campaigner for a second referendum.She said the country had moved on from the leave-versus-remain argument and the debate was “looking ahead to the vote”. She said it would be a chance to present her deal to the British people and draw comparisons with Labour’s position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3f2f8dd08570fffd6fdb3c410a66f2ef0db4bb/99_0_2833_1700/master/2833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fb16556ba09832f7caa4d7ab4cd8921","title":"spacewatch nasa launch crewed spacecraft","story":"Capsules being developed to act as taxis between Earth and International Space StationNasa and its commercial partners, Boeing and SpaceX, are nearing the end of their programme to develop new crew capsules that will act as taxis between Earth and the International Space Station (ISS).Two final uncrewed test flights have been confirmed for next year, which will be followed by the first astronauts in the summer.The US has been without the domestic means to launch its astronauts since 2011, when the Space Shuttle was retired.

The move could result in the maximum number of non-EU medics able to come rising to as many as 3,000.The length of time young doctors from outside the EU are able to stay in Britain under the scheme may also rise from two to three years, according to well-placed sources.The change comes as the government is under pressure to explain how its intention to move to a new immigration system after Brexit, with right of entry dependent on skills, will help alleviate NHS under-staffing.Ministers believe the NHS-wide shortage of medics is so acute, especially in hospitals, that they have to lift the cap on the number who can come in under the MTI, even at the risk of provoking a row about immigration.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been lobbying the Home Office over the issue in recent months. He recently wrote to Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, to suggest the change and has played a key role in making it happen.Senior doctors with whom Hancock has discussed the issue say he “fully appreciates” the depth of the NHS’s inability to recruit and retain enough medics and the impact it is increasingly having on patient care, for example forcing some A\u0026ampE units to close temporarily or permanently.The move is likely to be unveiled in the NHS long-term plan, due out in mid-December, soon after the “meaningful vote” by MPs on Brexit on 11 December. It will set out how the service in England sees its key priorities for the next decade and how it will spend the extra £20.5bn a year in funding it is due to receive by 2023-24.The NHS in England is short of 9,337 doctors, according to the latest official figures on staffing, which were published on Thursday by the regulator NHS Improvement. Although that is down from the 11,616 vacancies it had three months ago NHS bosses say that staffing problems remain their biggest headache and are compromising the quality of care they can provide.Ministers have been persuaded that expanding the MTI will not prompt a backlash because doctors coming to Britain that way do not count towards the immigration total. That is because the MTI counts as an exchange scheme that shares knowledge, experience and best practice.The young doctors are trainees who spend two years learning from an NHS consultant, and help fill medical rotas in hospitals, before returning to their home countries, which benefit from their enhanced skills.Health Education England, the NHS body in charge of the education and training of health service staff, supports boosting MTI numbers. Medical groups, including the Royal College of Physicians, have also been lobbying ministers to approve the change.“The MTI provides important benefits to the NHS and global healthcare development. The NHS benefits by employing talented international doctors in places that have not been able to attract suitable trainees. These posts would either have remained unfilled or would be covered by expensive locums,” said Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers.“There are huge workforce shortages across the NHS, and we will need to rely on international doctors to help us deliver services, to complement our homegrown talent and the expansion of medical schools.“Our hope is that there will be continued support within the NHS long-term plan and immigration white paper for the MTI, especially in the face of enormous pressures on overstretched teams,” Mortimer added.The scheme is administered by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents the professional interests of the UK’s 240,000 doctors.“We don’t know what’s in the long-term plan, but if this increase is true, it’s good news. The academy has long argued for an increase in the number of MTI doctors who can contribute to the NHS as they come to the UK to expand their training,” said Prof Carrie MacEwen, its chair.“The MTI scheme is a win all round. An increase in international trainees will help alleviate the pressures on the frontline in the NHS,” she added.A government spokesperson praised the MTI but refused to answer questions about its planned expansion. “This government welcomes the role of the MTI in allowing overseas medical staff the chance to train in the UK, observe clinical practice and to learn vital skills. While they are training in the UK, these international doctors gain state-of-the art skills and experience, which they can take back and use to benefit healthcare globally.“We are absolutely clear that these roles are not designed to fill substantive vacancies, but offer a valuable training opportunity for doctors from overseas. As with the other government authorised exchange schemes, the MTI scheme is subject to regular review to ensure it continues to meet its aims and those of the immigration system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca7b235595fa0b3ae1cf652ac0b45d5c62f132f/0_7_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25fe90cc7b0ea5fc5cd29a228e549932","title":"mps call for rogue landlords to lose properties","story":"During debate, MPs from all sides urge housing minister to introduce new seizure powersMPs have called on the government to confiscate properties from the country’s worst landlords after a series of revelations about tenants being exploited by rogue sections of the private rented housing sector.The calls followed a hard-hitting select committee report in April, as well as a joint  and ITV News investigation which last month revealed that convicted landlords ruled unfit to rent out their properties were continuing to operate by exploiting a gap in the law.During a debate on the committee’s recommendations on Thursday, MPs from across the Commons urged the housing minister Heather Wheeler to introduce new powers to seize properties of the worst landlords.“They’re making lots of money out of it, they’re making proceeds out of their crime. Let’s take off them the asset that enables them to do that.”Wheeler failed to respond to the request during the Westminster Hall debate and Betts later told the : “I don’t know why the government is resisting it. Confiscation and publicising those criminal landlords – that will be the focus now of trying to get serious change.”The investigation by the  and ITV also revealed that central government’s rogue landlord database was completely empty six months after its launch – and even when it finally contained entries the public would be barred from accessing it. The finding led to an U-turn by Theresa May, who pledged to open up the database to tenants.There is cross-party support for both publicising the conduct of the sector’s worst offenders as well as confiscating criminal landlords’ properties, which was recommended in the April report.During Thursday’s debate, Bob Blackman, a Conservative member of the committee member, said: “The sad reality is that if landlords fail the fit and proper person test to be landlords and they’re banned then all their tenants should know about it. That just makes sense. So to have a position where a landlord can be banned in one borough and carry on renting in others just does not make sense at all.“I agree that in the most serious cases just a fine becomes part of doing the business. Having the ability to confiscate the property and to protect the tenants from the behaviours of rogue or criminal landlords has to be the final issue.”Wheeler would not comment about confiscating property and would only refer to councils’ existing powers. She said: “Councils already have a range of powers to tackle rogue landlords, including the ability to take over the management of privately rented properties.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab25e9e6428a84259629e31e0c9baafc4a2efd49/0_213_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36523615a0656f2836e84ef710325297","title":"woman pregnancy turned out 26kg ovarian cyst","story":"Keely Favell lost third of her body weight after operation to take out growth discovered by obstetric ultrasoundA woman has told of how an ovarian cyst weighing 26kg (57lb) was removed from her body after doctors insisted at first that she must be pregnant.Keely Favell lost a third of her body weight after surgery to remove the growth. She had started to gain weight in 2014, but only went to see a doctor about it in 2016 after she blacked out while at work.Despite numerous inconclusive blood tests coming back, a GP decided she was pregnant, Favell wrote in a blogpost describing her experience.“Looking at me, anyone would have assumed I was nine months pregnant, so naturally they referred me to my local hospital for a pregnancy ultrasound,” said the 28-year-old from Swansea.The ultrasound led to an emergency CT scan which showed she had a large ovarian mass, prompting a referral to a high-risk obstetrics consultant who told her surgery was a “must” and that four weeks later she would be “cut open from my chest bone all the way down to my pelvic bone, pretty much like an old-fashioned C-section.”She wrote of undergoing four hours of surgery at Swansea’s Singleton hospital in March last year to a remove a cyst that she later nicknamed Mr Whippy.Favell said she was home four days later, adding: “My recovery since has been plain sailing and although there have been a few hiccups along the way, some of which are still yet to be sorted, I am now of much better health than that of last year. Both physically and mentally.”She told the BBC that the cyst appeared to grow so slowly at first that she did not believe anything was wrong. “I’ve been with my partner Jamie Gibbins for 10 years and we did wonder a few times if I was pregnant, but we did home tests and they always ruled it out,” she said.She said it was so embarrassing explaining to people she was not pregnant that she decided to go along with well-wishers who asked her about her due date.

Experts said the real incidence of FGM is likely to be far higher, however, as it remains a largely hidden crime.More than 30 cases a week are now coming to the attention of social work teams, with 1,630 cases in 2017-18, up from 1,460 cases the previous year. The figures were drawn from analysis of government statistics on children in need.Anita Lower, LGA lead on FGM, said: “These figures show the worrying prevalence of FGM, which is ruining lives and destroying communities.“At a time when they should be preparing for adult life and enjoying being young, no girl or young woman should be subject to the horrors of genital mutilation, which is child abuse and cannot be justified for any reason.”The LGA is calling for additional government funding for children’s services and also for the National FGM Centre – a joint initiative between the LGA and Barnardo’s, which works in communities supporting those affected by FGM and building relationships with families to try to prevent it.Over the past two and a half years, the centre has worked with 354 families and has been involved with 22 FGM protection orders. These impose conditions to protect victims or potential victims such as surrendering a passport so a girl cannot be taken abroad for FGM. The centre’s staff also work with police at airports, raising awareness about FGM.Leethen Bartholomew, head of the centre, said: “Whilst we are making progress in tackling FGM, these alarming statistics show it is still being practised in communities across England. Even more concerning is that these figures are likely to just be the tip of the iceberg because many cases of FGM go undetected.“The National FGM Centre’s work includes training social workers to become better at identifying girls who may be at risk of undergoing the practice, and to know how to report it.“This includes developing an online assessment tool so they are guided through the right questions to ask families. This is vital because the sooner they identify a potential case, the sooner action can be taken to protect the girl in question.”These latest figures are part of a wider picture of growing pressure on children’s services, with councils warning of a £3bn funding gap by 2025. According to the LGA, social workers are opening “episode of need” cases for more than 1,000 children every day, and more than half involve abuse or neglect.Responding to the analysis, a government spokesperson said: “Violence and abuse is unacceptable in any context. Children must be kept safe, and no belief system can justify the abuse of a child.“Those responsible for child abuse linked to faith or belief would be subject to prosecution. Our statutory guidance is clear that anyone who has concerns about a child’s welfare should report this to children’s social care or the police.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7948e2630334b4d9c147f15b497860647218b9a8/0_0_5119_3072/master/5119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c70b917c53d8d164962f0d817f674542","title":"study suggests rate of foetal alcohol syndrome disorder higher than thought","story":"Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is diagnosed from a collection of mental and physical problems in a child, including some distinctive facial features, such as a small head, small eyes and a thin upper lip. It can be associated with learning difficulties and mood problems.The new study, published in the journal Preventive Medicine, was carried out by researchers at Bristol and Cardiff Universities, looking into the records of nearly 13,500 children born in the 1990s whose families had signed up to a major, ongoing study.They developed a screening tool to analyse the data and assess whether children born to any woman who said she had drunk alcohol during her pregnancy had symptoms consistent with FASD.Dr Cheryl McQuire, researcher in epidemiology and alcohol-related outcomes at the University of Bristol, who led the research, said this sort of screening “is not the same as a formal diagnosis.“Nevertheless, the high rates of prenatal alcohol use and FASD-relevant symptoms that we found in our study suggest that FASD is likely to be a significant public health concern in the UK.”It was important to have better figures, so that children affected could get the help they needed, she said.However, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) disputed the figures and warned that women who are pregnant could panic and consider abortion if the results were miscommunicated.“We advise real caution over the interpretation and communication of these findings,” said Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at the charity, which sees over 70,000 women each year for pregnancy counselling and abortion care.“This study, as the authors themselves acknowledge, does not prove any causal link between pregnancy drinking and the developmental outcomes recorded, and may cause pregnant women and parents needless anxiety.“Many women have drunk before finding out they are pregnant, and messaging around pregnancy drinking which overstates risk or distorts the available evidence can lead some women to consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy, or spend that pregnancy wracked with guilt and anxiety. This does not benefit anyone.”Campaigners welcomed the findings, however. “These figures should raise alarm bells throughout Westminster and wake up everyone in the NHS and the Department of Health, who for decades have been keeping their heads in the sand about this largely avoidable public health crisis,” said Sandra Butcher, chief executive of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome-UK.She and other support groups hail the advice of the chief medical officer, Sally Davies, in 2016, who said it was safest for women who were pregnant or trying to conceive not to drink at all. But they said the government needs a strategy for diagnosing children and supporting the families.Dr Christopher Steer, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said many cases remained undiagnosed and that screening studies of children are needed. “FASD remains the most common and potentially preventable cause of learning and behavioural difficulties in the world,” he said.“While we incorporated expert clinical judgment in our algorithm specification and validation process, it was not feasible to conduct inidualised assessments of FASD.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3c275081ffe4359cc81b0c2c6cfbb01a81d4fa/0_38_1290_774/master/1290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1b106a4f976dbf4fe0535682197209","title":"uk housebuilding revolution 65000 prefab homes go into production","story":"Two Yorkshire factories try to tackle housing crisis with modular two and three-bedroom homesThe UK is entering a new era of prefab homes with the opening of a Yorkshire factory that will build fully-fitted three-bedroom homes with a price tag as low as £65,000.Eight houses fitted with kitchens and bathrooms will roll off the production line every day in Knaresborough, to be loaded on to lorries for delivery across the country. Experts have hailed it a revolution in British housebuilding that would slash the 40 weeks it could take to build a traditional home to just 10 days.The factory cost of a two or three-bedroom home would be from £65,000 to £79,000, although that excludes the cost of land, on-site assembly and connecting the home to services, which could double or triple the final price.The plant, operated by the UK company Ilke Homes, said it would produce 2,000 houses a year, rising eventually to 5,000, which would catapult it into the top echelon of volume housebuilders in the country.Meanwhile, the insurance company Legal \u0026amp General has built a vast factory outside Leeds which it said would build 3,500 homes a year, with the first two and three-bedroom homes being delivered in the past few weeks. It said it intended to build similar factories in locations across the UK, which would turn L\u0026ampG into a bigger builder than Persimmon or Barratt Developments.The term prefab has been shunned by the new housebuilders. The new buzz phrase, with its connotation of low-quality, postwar emergency housing,has instead been described as “modular construction”. Developers have been promising homes built to higher standards than those using traditional methods. They also claim energy bills would be half that of a conventional home due to better insulation.The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, speaking at the opening of the Knaresborough site on Thursday, said the factory would help the government reach an annual target of 300,000 new homes in England. Last year nearly 220,000 homes were built in England. “This is about challenging the ways we have done things in the past. We want to see 300,000 homes being delivered by the mid-2020s, so we need to scale up and build more, better and faster. And that is precisely what this facility is about,” he said.But people interested in the new homes should not expect an Amazon-style delivery service. The first buyers of the factory-built homes were housing associations and councils, which could order in bulk. And they are not ultra-modern homes both Ilke and L\u0026ampG’s first run of production-line homes follow traditional designs.“Our homes come fully fitted with kitchen, bathroom, plumbing and electrics all included. They are ready to inhabit almost immediately. But because of current customer tastes, we add a brick facade to the front on site. That can take a few weeks. Our customers want traditional homes with normal slated roofs,” said Rosie Toogood, of L\u0026ampG Modular.Once constructed, the Ilke 40 sq metre modules are loaded on to low-loader lorries, transported mostly at night on motorways and bolted together on site. Currently, the record has been 36 hours for assembling a house at the location, but one to two weeks was more likely to be the norm.This echoes challenges faced by developers in Japan, which has a high proportion of modular housing built in highly-automated factories, reflecting its declining population – , with carpenters and tradespeople difficult to find.Some critics fear factory-built housing would condemn families to identikit “rabbit-hutch homes” no bigger than the size of the trucks on which they are delivered. But inside, the homes, while small, were perfectly liveable, although short of storage space. The two-beds were about 80 sq metres, with living rooms a maximum of 4.5 metres by 3.2 metres. Ceiling heights were a minimum of 2.5 metres. Toogood, who joined L\u0026ampG from Rolls Royce, said the company aimed to completely disrupt the existing model for building homes.“We are building a new industry here, designing in different ways and redefining the housebuilding process. We are changing the supply line, and building at a pace never seen before.”Bjorn Conway, the chief executive of private equity-backed Ilke, said: “We are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We took a licence on this factory just 12 months ago and have already delivered the first homes. We are deconstructing construction, and driving productivity improvements, without relying on hard-to-find construction skills.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/041b61eebab5ba0e5b20e2bae6e56fe8099f6ac8/0_70_3288_1973/master/3288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6aac2f730b5f175986f01ccec7948b82","title":"jofra archer available england ecb eligbility rules cricket","story":"• In-demand fast bowler could now play in World Cup and Ashes• ECB’s residency rules cut from seven years to threeEngland have been accused of poaching Caribbean talent by the chief executive of West Indies following a decision to cut residency requirements from seven years to three and thus make Jofra Archer eligible for next summer’s World Cup and Ashes series.Archer, the highly rated Sussex fast bowler who was born in Barbados, is the obvious beneficiary of the rule changes announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board on Thursday, having previously been looking until the winter of 2022-23 before qualifying for England. This was because the 23-year‑old, despite holding a British passport through his English father, arrived in the UK in 2015, after his 18th birthday. Under the new rules, British citizens, or those born in the UK, require three years of residency to be selected, provided they have not played as a “local” in an overseas competition in this time.The ECB has stressed the rule change is not about an inidual player and it brings English cricket in line with rest of the world. But Johnny Grave, the chief executive of Cricket West Indies, has nevertheless expressed his dismay that Archer, who rose through the Barbados system and played international Under-19s cricket for West Indies, could soon be representing another country.“I hope no other West Indian cricketers follow that path and hope it doesn’t lead to counties doing their talent ID in the Caribbean, taking our players into the public school system and then on to offering them lucrative long-term county contracts and then possibly on to playing for England.”Archer’s decision to leave the Caribbean for Sussex, where he rose to prominence in club cricket before signing for the county, came after missing out on selection for the Under‑19s World Cup in 2014. Though he did not attend public school in the UK, the switch followed advice from Chris Jordan, who also grew up in Barbados and moved to England aged 15 via a scholarship at Dulwich College in south-east London.The ECB’s new residency rules require a player to be in the country for 210 days a year between April and March and with Archer committed to playing for Hobart Hurricanes in Australia’s Big Bash League this winter – with whom he shot to global prominence last year and then secured a lucrative deal in the Indian Premier League – he will not have completed his third year until mid-March.It means the right-arm quick will likely miss out on the tour to the Caribbean that starts in January, with the one-day series being England’s final five matches in the format before they submit their provisional World Cup squad on 23 April. With their attack seemingly short of a bowler who can consistently hit 90mph, however, there is a chance Archer may still enter the selection debate.As well as reducing their self-imposed seven-year residency criteria, the ECB board has also signed off on the playing regulations for its new 100-ball competition from 2020. As expected, the format will be 10 blocks of 10 balls for each innings, with bowlers allowed to bowl five or 10 of these at a time but no more than 20 in total.A Barbados-born fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman who holds a British passport through his English father and plays for Sussex. He was serving a  seven-year qualification period to play for England (due to be completed in the winter of 2022) but following the rule change, should now be eligible for England selection by mid-March once a third year of spending 210 days in the country has been completed.What is all the fuss about?With an ability to bowl at 90mph and at the death in white-ball cricket, excitement about Archer began from the moment he made his first-team debut for Sussex in 2016. But it was when playing overseas Twenty20 cricket last winter, and an a eye-catching spell for Hobart Hurricanes in Australia’s Big Bash League in particular, that his stock rose exponentially and a £800,000 contract in the Indian Premier League followed.Why isn’t he playing for West Indies?Despite having come through the Barbados age-groups and having played Under-19s cricket for West Indies, his omission from the U19s World Cup in 2014 led to disillusionment with the system in the Caribbean. After encouragement from his fellow Bajan, the Sussex and England all-rounder Chris Jordan, Archer then moved to the UK the following summer, where he played league cricket for both Middleton and Horsham before cracking the first team at Sussex in 2016. He has previously described representing England as his\u0026nbsp“dream”.What are his chances of playing the World Cup and Ashes next year?England have just five ODIs in the Caribbean in February before their provisional World Cup squad is named on 23 April, all of which come before Archer is eligible. It would therefore represent a gamble of sorts to fast-track him into the set-up and one that Eoin Morgan, the captain, has previously downplayed. Joe Root and the national selector, Ed Smith, may yet be tempted by his additional pace in the Ashes series that follows, however."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ed974ec359a907ed36110eb64efb20a5ae41ec5/59_137_4296_2577/master/4296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=740f0d2cfb60b242b4e228f133887562","title":"magnus carlsen my last world championship match chess","story":"As Magnus Carlsen sat in his dressing room, euphoric and chatty after finally suppressing the stubborn resistance of Fabiano Caruana to retain his world chess title, he made a stark confession. “If I had lost, it could very well have been my last world championship match.”The words came as a thunderous bolt from the blue and they are bound to send tremors through the chess world. After all, Carlsen has been the world No 1 since 2010 and would have been a warm favourite to regain his title in 2020 if he had lost. Yet, for the first time, here he was acknowledging that he would have contemplated turning his back on the biggest prize in his sport at the age of 27.The brilliant Norwegian, who retained his title with a thumping 3-0 rapid-play victory over Caruana on Wednesday after all 12 classical games were drawn, was just as frank when asked whether he could ever again scale the heights of his peak Fide rating of 2,882, the highest in history, which he obtained in his early twenties.“It is going to be very difficult,” says Carlsen, whose ranking now stands at 2,835, three ahead of his American rival. “It is a lot about the mindset. There is no pure chess reason in terms of understanding the game that I should play worse than I have before. But these games show that I have not been able to take all my chances. I need to work on that to be even sharper the next time.”At least there will be a next time. Before the match Carlsen’s frustrations with his performances had led his sister Ellen to hint that Carlsen might retire if he was defeated. When asked whether such a course of action was really on his mind, he replies: “For sure,” before clarifying his position. “If I had lost, it could very well have been my last world championship match.”When pressed why, Carlsen replies: “I don’t know. I wouldn’t have retired from chess but I might not have played another world championship match. But now we’ll see. I have a lot of time over the next two years to improve my game.”The sport certainly needs him to stick around. For these days the Norwegian is a bona fide celebrity, guest-starring on The Simpsons, modelling for G-Star Raw and making $8m (£6.25m) a year according to Forbes magazine. Such is Carlsen’s popularity in Norway that his matches were shown live on NRK, the equivalent of BBC One, with Wednesday’s tie–breaks breaking all previous records for Carlsen’s games. Three million of the country’s five million population watched at least some part of the match.The Magnus effect has extended to participation levels in his country, with the Norwegian Chess Federation confirming that close to half a million play regularly online. Interest in the match also spread far beyond Norway with the website Chess saying that millions had watched its live coverage over the 20 days.It surely helped that there was plenty of intrigue off the board too. Early in the match, images of Caruana’s preparation leaked online, leaving many to speculate whether this was a huge blunder or a cunning ruse to throw his opponent off the scent – while Carlsen arrived for game 9 with a black eye after smashing into a Norwegian journalist while playing football on a rest day.The contest finally ended on Wednesday after more than 50 hours of play over 15 games, but it might have been a much shorter story if Carlsen had converted a vastly superior position in the first game. However, he was unable to navigate his way through the battle fog and the match quickly descended into the chess equivalent of trench warfare, with all 12 games of classical chess drawn.Some feared that Carlsen’s near‑legendary desire to win every game had turned into an altogether more human desire not to lose – especially when he offered a draw in a better position in game 12. Vladimir Kramnik, the world champion from 2000-2008, even suggested “this is not the Magnus we have come to know”, while Garry Kasparov, who held the title from 1985-2000, wondered whether Carlsen was losing his nerve.It turned out he was merely playing possum. In the rapid-play tie-breaks – where both players had 25 minutes to make all their moves – Carlsen was much more like his old self: his play turbo-charged and confident, his tenacity irresistible. “I always knew if it went to a tie-break I would have good chances,” he says.“On Tuesday, I just tried to relax, I played some football and got a good night’s sleep and when I woke up I felt very good. I knew from early on in game 1 that I had good chances. It was just a very good day.”Carlsen later celebrated his victory in the modest surroundings of Wetherspoons in Holborn, where he happily posed for pictures with fans. It was a welcome release after months of preparation that had involved hours of daily study along with regular football and basketball sessions, 30-60 minute runs, hot yoga and a largely vegetarian diet to get him into the best possible shape for the physical and psychological stresses of a world-title match.But not all had gone to plan and when asked whether he was looking forward to not bashing his head against Caruana’s ultra-solid Petroff defence, he laughs. “Yeah, for sure,” he says. “That is one of the things I need to improve on. My white openings in this match weren’t great and I barely got any playable positions. Fortunately, I played well with black to counter that.“The match shows Fabiano is at pretty much the same level as I am in classical chess right now. Huge credit to him, but that is not something I was completely satisfied with.”The result leaves Carlsen as the king of the chess world for at least another two years, given he is not due to face his next challenger until 2020. But the future of the championship itself is more of a dangling question. For many it remains the original E-Sport and the fact that such huge online audiences followed a game that emphasises the merits of thinking fast and slow, shows its potential. However, some players, such as the strong Dutch grandmaster Anish Giri, believe that so many draws in such a high-profile match could scare sponsors away.Carlsen believes that the world championship format needs to be spiced up, either with a longer format or more rapid games. “In general it’s good to incorporate more rapid and blitz in the world championship because to some extent it is a purer form of chess because preparation plays less of a role,” he says. “Instead, it is more about quick calculation, intuition and instinct, all of the things I think are important in chess. So I would like that – and also more games in the match to give more room for experiments and taking chances.”Whatever happens next Carlsen will fancy his chances. His powers may not be quite as supreme as they once were but he remains the man to beat and as he reminded his rivals yet again across three captivating weeks in London if you come for the king you best not miss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1558290a55a1b8dcc55b7ea7472e7200c9a80b5f/0_104_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d5a5e009784d8e721aa21e946cc9e7","title":"10 best christmas festivities overseas readers travel tips","story":"See lights in Brooklyn, dodge the beastly Krampus in Austria, cheer Santa on in Venice ... or just hit the beach down underNew York may be magical at Christmas but Dyker Heights in Brooklyn is perhaps the Christmas lights capital of the world!

On the eve of St Nicholas Day (when good children get chocolate and gifts), the devil appears on the streets to chase naughty children and take them away to hell. The Krampus is not for the faint hearted: a giant, horned, hairy beast carrying a flaming torch and, sometimes, with real “kidnapped” children riding in a box on its back. It has giant bells tied round its waist so at least you can hear it coming. But be warned – if any locals notice you looking nervous, you will be herded and pushed in front of the monster to be whipped.Sarah CollingsWe took an early morning jog along the banks of the Mekong in Phnom Penh in Cambodia, past families taking picnics in the park all dressed up in Santa costumes. Our trip to the Killing Fields was probably the most moving, harrowing Christmas Day I’ve ever spent but I wouldn’t have missed it for the world. We really needed our post-visit cocktails by the pool.Katie HepworthSpending a Christmas in Poland skiing is joyous, especially with the traditional 12-course Christmas Eve dinner (wigilia). There is no meat served as it is a course for each of Jesus’s disciples with dishes such as pierogi (filled dumplings), carp and exceptional Polish cheesecake. The Zakopane mountains have great skiing and parties fuelled by Polish vodka – much cheaper than the Alps.• discoverzakopaneMarysia TrembeckaLast year, we spent Christmas in Berlin on a home-swap deal. Wonderful. The Prenzlauer Berg district was quiet and we cycled through the city all week (bikes lent to us by our hosts), far from the madding crowd, as it were. Cold and sunny, we cycled to museums, to parks, to the Berliner Philharmonie for a concert, to the Liquidrom Spa for a sauna, stopping for a glass of mulled wine at Christmas markets in the evening. It only cost us the flight (about €170 return from Paris) and the bus to and from the airport. One of the best Christmas holidays ever.Benedicte BoussetQuebec City at Christmas is a magical place that all generations will enjoy. Our kids adored skating at the ice-rink in Place D’Youville and zooming down the toboggan run at Les Glissades de la Terrasse. The grandparents’ favourite was exploring the Dickensian charm of Old Quebec’s streets, which sparkled with snow, tinsel and fairylights, and browsing the gorgeous Christmas market. Our highlights included a meal in Hotel de Glace, North America’s only ice hotel, and (free!) skating on the vast Plains of Abraham. We all sang carols outside Château Frontenac. We rented an apartment, though hotels for all budgets abound. RobOne of our most memorable Christmas trips was spent in Ha Long Bay. The three-day cruise included a trip to Cát Bà Island and a visit to a traditional pearl village. On Christmas Eve, the crew made a “traditional” meal of barbecued goose, followed by a laser show on the top deck.• About £91pp with transfers from Hanoi, tourshalongShahnazThe pristine, white Papamoa beach in New Zealand was a great place to spend Christmas Day. A morning jog, swim, sunbathe then a long, lazy picnic on the beach, with the feelgood factor increasing as families shared their hampers with each other, made for a very uplifting experience. Inspired by some excellent local wine, I even plucked up courage to take part in the sunset haka contest in the evening, giving an energetic performance in front of the judges. Result: second place and another bottle of wine.ChloeVisiting Venice for Christmas was a beautiful experience, wonderful comforting carb-rich food, snow-dusted islands and candlelit churches, all without the crowds.

Grab a ferry from Hillarys Boat Harbour for around £40 return to enjoy stunning scenery, unique wildlife (quokkas are only found on islands in this part of the country) and glorious beaches.

On 21 August, Ruggles caused a stir at a routine committee meeting when she announced she was concerned that Hawaii was not a part of the US, but instead an occupied foreign country.“What I’m asking challenges the foundation of everything that we believe to be true in Hawaii,” Ruggles told the .A lifetime Puna resident and progressive local politician who normally focuses on issues including taxation, infrastructure, and the environment, Ruggles said she came to this conclusion after reading a memo penned by an independent expert at the United Nations and believed the claims of the often-ignored Hawaiian sovereignty movement. She hasn’t voted in a council or committee meeting since, and as a result has not been allowed to attend meetings. It has led to an outcry from Hawaii residents who say she’s shirking her responsibilities.The claim that Hawaii is still a part of the Hawaiian Kingdom (not the US) is not new. In fact, it’s a sticky political situation that has led to court cases and provided talking points to more than one US president. But public conversations on the topic still have the air of a conspiracy theory, because the idea runs so counter to the day-to-day administrative and governmental operations in Hawaii. As such, the subject tends to be avoided by Hawaii politicians. The tropical island chain, located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, 2,467 miles from the continental US, became a state in 1959. And for most people, that’s more than enough evidence that it’s part of the US.Ruggles told the  that she had heard Hawaiian sovereignty arguments for years, but had never taken the time to research the claims in detail. Then, in June, an email caught her attention. It contained a February 2018 memo on letterhead from the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. It seemed unusual: support for the idea of Hawaiian sovereignty from an internationally respected third party.After researching the matter, Ruggles concluded that DeZayas was right – that Hawaii was never legally annexed by the United States. And once she saw that, she said, she couldn’t un-see the ramifications.She became concerned that she would be breaking international law by participating on the city council as an agent of the US government – something that could hypothetically leave her open to international war crimes charges.“It was uncomfortable. The look on some people’s faces … was horrified,” Ruggles said. “It’s a question that is really challenging the status quo and a lot of people shy away from that. Not a lot of people are up for the consequences, I have been experiencing a lot of retaliation.”The county’s legal adviser, Joseph Kamelamela, has been dismissive of Ruggles’ concerns and the memo.The office of the Hawaii governor, David Ige, and the US Department of State both declined to comment on the memo and Ruggle’s concerns. Yet as far back as 1893, President Grover Cleveland called the deposition of the Hawaiian queen and her government “an act of war committed … without the authority of Congress”. One hundred years later, Bill Clinton signed the so-called “apology bill”, which laid out the events that led to Hawaii statehood. Among those events was the formation of a provisional government “without the consent of the Native Hawaiian people or the lawful Government of Hawaii and in violation of treaties between the two nations and of international law”.As Keanu Sai, a political science lecturer at the University of Hawaii and member of the Hawaiian Kingdom provisional government puts it, the unilateral annexation of Hawaii by passing a law was tantamount to the US passing a law annexing the UK or any other country.“You can’t pass a law annexing a foreign country,” he said.In an email, a spokesman for the office of the commissioner for human rights disavowed DeZayas’s memo, saying it did not represent the opinion of the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights. “They are his own views and as such they should not have been sent out using our letterhead,” they wrote.DeZayas, who has now finished his term as the investigator and serves as a law professor at the Geneva School of Diplomacy and an international lecturer, said he wrote the memo because his job as the independent expert was to promote democracy, equality and “the right of self-determination of peoples (as) an effective conflict-prevention strategy.”Hawaii is “formally part of the US,” DeZayas said, but he feels that it’s important for people to understand how it got that way.As for Ruggles, her term ends Monday. While she will no longer be a local representative, she will continue to try to bring attention to what she sees as international law violations in Hawaii. She said she plans to meet with representatives from nonprofits like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross.“And I am going to request that they appoint a special rapporteur,” Ruggles said, “to start documenting human rights violations happening in Hawaii.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99a03c7797cd641a6503ae5a73c8e5da0b7e3af/0_0_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70e1c6c5a10292ec3995ed7f55a5ec6c","title":"g20 summit argentina 2018 ten years later populism","story":"Now in its 10th year, a forum intended to secure global governance has become a stage for increasingly populist leaders The leaders from the world’s 20 biggest economies converge on Buenos Aires on Friday looking for consensus on the global flows of trade and investment – at a time when such consensus has been increasingly difficult to come by.A forum intended to be a powerhouse of global governance has become a stage for an increasing number of authoritarian and populist leaders who are there to perform for their restive followers back home. Their power depends on dramatically defying the rule-based order the G20 was created to promote.They are converging on Buenos Aires like trillion-dollar stake poker players – an oddball bunch, each focused on winning, or being seen to win, at the expense of the others.Over the two days of the summit, there will be group sessions on financial architecture, sustainable agriculture and the future of work, but this year the big news is likely to be dominated by a set of bilateral duels with unpredictable outcomes.While the general idea is to talk about money, a lot of the conversations in Buenos Aires will be about blood. First to arrive on Wednesday, was Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman – less than two months after his henchmen killed and the dismembered journalist and regime critic Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate.As the prince set up camp in the Saudi embassy behind a fearsome security cordon in the leafy neighbourhood of Palermo Chico, an Argentinian prosecutor is looking into possible charges of crimes against humanity.The investigation may not get past his likely immunity as de facto head of state, but it is enough to take the shine off the ostensible goal of the trip to the G20 clubhouse: to show his subjects that he is no pariah, and to challenge the world leaders who buy his oil and sell him weapons to shake his hand in public.Khashoggi’s murder will hang heavily over the proceedings. Another attendee, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has so far refused to hush up the murder. He is due to hold a brief “pull-aside” encounter with Donald Trump, Prince Mohammed’s most fervent supporter, and Erdoğan’s office has not ruled out a meeting with the prince himself.The White House has sent mixed messages. The national security adviser, John Bolton, seemed to rule out a Trump meeting with Prince Mohammed, but Trump has repeatedly said he is willing. As has been the case for the past two years, Trump’s volatile demeanour will almost certainly provide the focal point. He tends not to prepare for such meetings, preferring to trust his gut feelings in the moment.On Trump’s appointment diary are meetings with his Argentinian host, Mauricio Macri, Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, India’s Narendra Modi, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and another “pull-aside” with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. Angela Merkel will be the one European leader due to have a personal meeting with the US president.A scheduled session with Putin was cancelled by Trump on his way to the summit, saying his decision had been based on Russia’s failure to return Ukrainian sailors and ships its forces had seized in the Sea of Azov on Sunday. The meeting was to have been any important gauge of the relationship between the two men, at a time when the investigation into his campaign’s links with the Kremlin is edging closer to him personally.On the day Trump left for Argentina, his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress about his contacts with Russian officials during the presidential campaign, over plans to build a Trump tower in Moscow.But the Putin meeting had been intended to address unfinished business on arms control from the two leaders’ Helsinki summit in July. Trump may confirm he is leaving the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, to which Russia has promised counter-measures. If the two leaders make no progress on extending the New Start treaty, limiting strategic nuclear weapons, the world will be heading towards the end of arms control within less than three years.Europe will be represented by the UK, France, Germany and Italy as well as the EU leadership. All of the above except Italy will be positioning themselves of the embattled liberal rule-based democratic order, with varying degrees of success.Theresa May will find it hard to project an aura of stability given the chaos at home, and will be on the alert for pitfalls and snubs that could underline the UK’s declining clout.With Merkel entering the last act of her leadership and an erratic president in the White House, Emmanuel Macron can be expected to continue his campaign to appropriate the mantle of leader of the western world.At last year’s G20 in Hamburg, he could be seen jostling his way through the other leaders until he got to the front row of the leaders group photo. It turned out he was just trying to find his way to his assigned place but it looked symbolic nonetheless.This year’s class photo is likely to be replete with the usual awkwardness – a gauge perhaps of Prince Mohammed’s status as pariah, and another chance to observe Trump’s combat-style grab-and-yank handshake. Even trickier will be the hosts’ task of trying to wangle agreement on a joint statement when it’s all over at Saturday lunchtime.Trump withdrew his signature from the G7 statement as he flew away from the Quebec summit in June. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last weekend failed to agree on a communique for the first time in its 25-year history. Lowest common denominators, once considered bland, are becoming hard to find."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f34ed543e19919195e982209aab4b7b5fe5d76/0_65_1127_676/master/1127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29d760e721bb79b9cbc080f5f5b9e45b","title":"scientists discover spider species that feeds its young milk","story":"Spider milk containing four times the protein of cow’s milk is secreted by mothers, scientists in China findThe ability of mothers to produce milk for their babies is commonly considered a unique feature of mammals, but now scientists have discovered a species of spider that also nurses its young.Spider mothers were observed feeding a milk-like substance to their spiderlings and continuing to look after them almost into adulthood.Lactation-like feeding is known elsewhere in the animal kingdom – pigeons and flamingos produce something called “crop milk” from a gland in their neck. However, the intensity and duration of maternal care observed in the spider species is considered highly unusual.The observations focused on a species of jumping spider, normally found in Taiwan, which lives in nests and mimics the appearance of ants. The newly hatched spiderlings were found to be entirely dependent on nutritious spider milk, containing nearly four times the protein of cow’s milk, secreted and fed to them by their mothers.The scientists observed that the spiderlings first drank from droplets of spider milk left on the surface of the nest and then by directly sucking from the mother’s egg-laying opening.The spider mothers continued to care for and feed their offspring for nearly 40 days, long after they were able to forage on their own and almost until the point of sexual maturity.The milk was not critical to the offsprings’ survival, but appeared to boost their overall health and chances of survival as adults.The findings, by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Yunnan, are published in the journal Science."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae662425d9cfaaaf73888cda905e461538729739/305_66_3110_1867/master/3110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a0a74c7f86913c97a3ff702d3b97f8","title":"friday briefing whos not meeting who at the g20","story":"PM plunges into fraught summit featuring Trump, Putin and Salman … US president lashes out as Cohen makes plea deal … and a new house for £65,000Hello on a Friday.

The White House is effectively threatening a trade war unless complaints about Chinese trading practices and state-sponsored theft of intellectual property are resolved. Angela Merkel is the one European leader due to have a personal meeting with Trump.Norway-plus not an option – Also while en route to Buenos Aires, the PM has ruled out striking a compromise to keep Britain in the European Economic Area and a customs union, similar to Norway’s arrangement with the EU. The Conservatives’ Nick Boles and Labour’s Stephen Kinnock are among backbenchers touting a “plan B” that they argue could make it through parliament with joint Labour-Tory support. But May insisted: “I’ve been very clear about my position, we won’t be in the customs union … What you see in the political declaration is what would be a deal for the United Kingdom that is not Norway, it is not Canada, it is a more ambitious free trade agreement than Canada, and it ends free movement – which Norway doesn’t do.”Justice for Berta – Seven men have been found guilty of the March 2016 murder of an internationally renowned Honduran environmentalist and indigenous rights activist.

The murder prosecution was dogged by claims of negligence, secrecy and bias in a country where corruption and impunity reign.Non-EU doctor will see you – More foreign doctors will be let into Britain to tackle NHS staff shortages under government plans, the  understands. The annual limit on non-EU medics could rise from 1,500 to 3,000 and they would be allowed to stay for three years instead of two. The move is likely to be unveiled in the NHS long-term plan, due out in mid-December, soon after the “meaningful vote” by MPs on Brexit. The government is under pressure to explain how its new immigration system after Brexit, with right of entry dependent on skills, will help alleviate NHS under-staffing.Trump-Russia: Cohen in plea deal – Donald Trump has trashed yet another former ally, calling Michael Cohen a “a weak person and not a very smart person” after the president’s former longtime personal lawyer admitted lying to Congress to protect him. Cohen has said in explosive testimony that Trump was trying to develop a tower in Moscow months into his campaign for the presidency – contradicting the Republican candidate’s account.The testimony comes after Cohen signed a plea deal with Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation. Mueller said Cohen worked on a plan for Trump to travel to Russia once he became the formal Republican nominee. Felix Sater, a Russian-born business associate of the Trumps, wrote to Cohen in May 2016 saying he had spoken “with Moscow” about a possible visit involving “the two big guys” – apparent references to Trump and Putin.Total fabrication – A Yorkshire factory is starting to churn out prefabricated homes that cost as little as £65,000 and can be put up in days rather than months. Eight houses fitted with kitchens and bathrooms will roll off the production line of Ilke Homes every day in Knaresborough, to be delivered by lorry across the country in the form of modules that are put together on site.

The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, speaking at the opening of the Knaresborough site on Thursday, said the factory would help the government reach an annual target of 300,000 new homes in England. The first buyers of the factory-built homes have been housing associations and councils, which can order in bulk.How did a forum for global cooperation become a stage for authoritarians? ’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, analyses the G20 ahead of the summit in Buenos Aires with the help of our foreign correspondents.

Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3715104.1543518618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"aer arann islands offered to communities for 1","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe PSO, worth €800,000 annually, requires the airline to provide 3,500 flights each year to Inis Mór, Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr on a fixed schedule. The owner of Aer Arann Islands has offered to sell the airline for €1 to the Aran Island communities amid an ongoing dispute with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Ghaeltacht. The airline, and its principal shareholder Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh, employs 40 staff. It has been in a protracted dispute over its Public Services Obligation (PSO) contract with the Department. The PSO, worth €800,000 annually, requires the airline to provide 3,500 flights each year to Inis Mór, Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr on a fixed schedule. Galway Aviations Services Ltd, trading as Aer Arann, has claimed the terms of the contract, which is almost two years through its four-year term, are too onerous. The airline says it faces deductions from allowances if it provides extra flights or departs from schedule. The 2017-2020 contract covers about 3,500 annual flights between the three Aran Islands and the Connemara airport at Indreabhán.The service has carried 42,000 people annually at peak, but this figure has fallen to just over 30,000 under the latest PSO terms.During high season in the summer, the airline provides up to 30 flights a day for touristsbut that falls to the bare minimum during the winter when the service is used by islanders. The airline has claimed the current PSO contract means it is running at a loss and cannot continue as a viable operation. Mr O Ceidigh announced earlier this year he cannot run the airline after December 6th, due to restrictions on the contract which is due to run until 2020. The number of passengers has fallen from over 40,000 at peak service to 30,000 last year. The Department has appointed consultants to provide an alternative service on an emergency basis after December 6th. However, the airport used in Connemara, Aerphort na Mine in Indreabhán is also owned by the airline. The nearest alternative airport is Shannon Airport in Co Clare but that has been ruled out for practical purposes. Tarlach de Blácam, owner of globally traded Inis Meáin knitwear, said the community-owned island companies in all three islands had looked very seriously at taking over the airline and had carried out due diligence. “We are utterly reliant on an air service in the island and cannot do without one,” he said. He said the communities have been willing to take over Aer Arann but wanted certain conditions . They included sufficient funding to carry out ongoing maintenance on the three aircraft (one its fleet of three ‘Islander’ planes is currently in the hangar awaiting maintenance and another is due for annual maintenance in January). He said the service needed to be improved through modernisation and marketing to encourage more passengers. “If we were to accept it we would have to make sure that a big investment was made and that Aerphort na Mine was available.”However, because the airline is already in receipt of the PSO contract, any further State funding might be regarded by the EU as a form of State aid. Other options explored in relation to community-ownership have included receivinga loan or preference shares from Udarás na Gaeltachta or receiving preference shares from the Udarás. However, such moves have not been sanctioned by the Department. Some three years ago, plans to replace Aer Arann with a helicopter service from Galway Airport was abandoned because islanders objected to helicopters, saying they were unsuitable unless the equivalent of a Sikorsky. The base for the service was to be Galway Airport, despite the fact that no arrangement had been made with local authorities to reopen the airport, which had closed several years beforehand. Lawyers for Galway Aviation Services and the Department, and Minister of State Sean Kynehave been in negotiations in an effort to ensure a continuity of service. It is understood one possible solution is a new PSO contract may be put out to tender with Aer Arann continuing to operate on a temporary basis. It is understood if the terms of the new contract are more favourable, Aer Arann may be one of the bidders.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Luckily, we had an excellent crew and the most experienced pilot of the special air mission wing.The airplane captain told passengers he had decided to land after the malfunction of several electronic systems, but said there had been no security risk.Mrs Merkel is unlikely to arrive before Friday eveningMrs Merkel and other passengers initially remained on board the aircraft, called Konrad Adenauer, as mechanics inspected its brakes and several fire engines waited nearby, according to a Reuters reporter on board.Der Spiegel magazine said the entire communication system malfunctioned, constituting a serious emergency, with the crew forced to plan the landing using an on-board satellite phone.Ursula von der Leyen, defence minister, was informed about the incident immediately, and tried for hours to organise an alternate aircraft to carry Mrs Merkel and her entourage.The delay will complicate Merkel\u0027s schedule at a meeting where the G20 members expect to face difficult negotiations on myriad issues.Mrs Merkel, who had planned bilateral meetings with the presidents of the United States, China, Russia and India, was unlikely to arrive in Buenos Aires until Friday evening, German government sources said. It was not immediately clear which bilateral meetings would have to be rescheduled.Mr Scholz was grounded on the same A340 aircraft last month after an International Monetary Fund meeting in Indonesia, according to German media reports. They said the issue involved damage caused by rodents. Please review our commenting policyMan clinging to tree rescued from a rushing river in LARail fare increase of up to £200 a year confirmed, as

November 30th (or in Scottish Gaelic \u0027Là Naomh Anndrais\u0027), celebrates Scotland\u0027s patron saint. It\u0027s also an excuse for Scotland to enjoy a good old bank holiday. But what\u0027s this day all about, and what did he do that was so saintly? ​St Andrew, according to Christianity\u0027s teachings, was a fisherman and one of Jesus Christ\u0027s apostles who was born in Bethsaida, in Galilee, now part of Israel (a long way from Scotland). Like Jesus, Andrew died a martyr after being killed by the Romans and was crucified in Greece on an X-shaped cross in 60 AD, rather than the \u0027T\u0027 shape cross that Jesus was crucified on. He apparently felt that he wasn\u0027t worthy to die on the same shape of cross as Jesus. This type of cross is also known as a saltire - the symbol that makes up the Scottish flag.His remains were moved 300 years after his death to Constantinople, now Istanbul, by the Emperor Constantine.We don\u0027t know too much more about him, but he was revered in Scotland from around 1,000 AD although he didn\u0027t become its official patron saint of Scotland until Scotland’s independence was declared with the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320.Pipers march during the Braemar Highland GamesSt Andrew\u0027s links with Scotland come from the Pictish King Oengus I, according to legend, who built a monastery in the Fife town of Kinrymont after the relics of the saint (said to include a tooth, kneecap, arm and finger bone) were brought to the town from Greece in the eighth century.The town became a major centre of pilgrimage and was later re-named St Andrews, where the famous Scottish university now stands.St Andrew was made the patron saint of Scotland after the king\u0027s descendant, Oengus II, prayed to St Andrew on the eve of a crucial battle against English warriors from Northumberland, around 20 miles east of Edinburgh.Legend has it that, heavily outnumbered, Oengus II told St Andrew that he would become the patron saint of Scotland if he were granted victory. On the day of the battle, clouds are said to have formed a saltire in the sky, and Oengus\u0027s army of Picts and Scots were victorious.The Saltire flag - a white cross on a blue background - is said to have come from this ine intervention and has been used to represent Scotland since 1385.In 1870, the Archbishop of Amalfi sent an apparent piece of the saint\u0027s shoulder blade to Scotland, where it has since been stored in St Mary\u0027s Cathedral in Edinburgh. The other relics were destroyed in the Scottish Reformation.35 great quotes about Scotland and the ScotsNovember 30, 60AD is supposedly the date that St Andrew was crucified, which is why the patron saint\u0027s day falls on this date each year, although it is the following Monday if a Saturday or Sunday.However, it wasn\u0027t until the 18th century that celebrating St Andrew\u0027s Day became common in Scotland. And bizarrely the tradition didn\u0027t even start in Scotland, but in South Carolina in 1729 where a group of wealthy ex-pat Scots started the \u0027St Andrew’s Society of Charleston\u0027 because they were missing home.The group became well known in the area for their charitable endeavours, helping the poor and needy and it was from here that St Andrew\u0027s societies began to spread around the world.In 2006 St Andrew\u0027s Day was made a bank holiday in Scotland, and has traditionally been a day off for students of St Andrews University. While St Andrew\u0027s Day in Scotland and St Patrick\u0027s Day in Northern Ireland are bank holidays, St George\u0027s Day in England and St David\u0027s Day in Wales are not, which is usually a source of some frustration every year. The day is usually marked by a celebration of Scottish culture, including dancing, food and music, and both the British Prime Minister and Scotland\u0027s First Minister give St Andrew\u0027s Day messages.St Andrew is also the patron saint of Greece, Russia, Romania, Amalfi in Italy and Barbados, where St Andrew\u0027s Day is celebrated as the national day of Independence on the Caribbean island.As the patron saint of Barbados, St Andrew is celebrated in a number of Bajan symbols including the cross formation of the Barbadian Coat of Arms and the country\u0027s national honours system, which styles persons as Knights or Dames of St Andrew.St Andrew is also the patron saint of the Order of the Thistle, one of the highest ranks of chivalry in the world and second only to the Order of the Garter.He also keeps busy as the patron saint of fishmongers, fishermen, women wanting to be mothers, singers, spinsters, maidens, sore throats and gout.November 30 also holds significance in other countries. In parts of eastern and central Europe, including Romania, Russia, Austria, Germany and Poland, the date is associated with single girls\u0027 future husbands.In Romania, it is customary for young women to put 41 grains of wheat beneath their pillow before they go to sleep, and if they dream that someone is coming to steal their grains that means that they are going to get married next year.Other traditions involve pouring wax through a keyhole into cold water, with the resulting shape determining a girl\u0027s future husband\u0027s profession.Man clinging to tree rescued from a rushing river in LARail fare increase of up to £200 a year confirmed, as government blames union greed for hikesBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May rules out Norway-style Brexit if she loses Commons voteTheresa May arrives in Argentina for the G20 summitTwenty-one Scottish business groups urge SNP to ditch out-of-town \u0026#39Amazon tax\u0026#39Comment: Brexit has completely failed \u0026#39left behinds\u0026#39 angry with the dismal status quoThe grudges to watch as world leaders arrive for stormy G20 summitAngela Merkel to miss G20 opening after plane \u0026#39malfunction\u0026#39 forces unscheduled landing 2.4-million-year-old tools found in Algeria could upend human origin storyAirline apologises for staff who mocked five-year-old Abcde\u0026#39s nameFive dead and 32 injured in Hong Kong coach crashDrinking in pregnancy could be causing defects to one in six babies Fat-free shakes and soups: NHS pins hopes on liquid-only diet to reverse diabetesWizard of Oz beats Star Wars as most influential film of all time, study of 47,000 movies showsTheresa May under pressure to raise Khashoggi murder with Saudi Crown Prince at G20 summitSculpture made with 100,000 confiscated blades highlights UK knife crimeCairnGorm Mountain resort placed into administrationDrunk pilot who tried to fly plane at Heathrow while ten times over limit caught after gargling mouthwash We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may arrives argentina g20 summit","story":"Theresa May has arrived in Buenos Aires for the G-20 summit on Friday.Issues such as a trade war between the United States and China, the killing of a Saudi journalist in the country\u0027s Istanbul Consulate and the conflict over Ukraine are threatening to overshadow the gathering of leaders of the globe\u0027s largest economies.For May, it also comes as she is struggling to win support among British lawmakers for the deal she agreed with the EU on Brexit.Theresa May says TV debate on Brexit deal is vital so public can \u0026#39see she has a plan\u0026#39Watch the dramatic helicopter rescue of a man clinging for dear life to a tree in stormy river waters Rail fare increase of up to £200 a year confirmed, as government blames union greed for hikesBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May rules out Norway-style Brexit if she loses Commons voteTwenty-one Scottish business groups urge SNP to ditch out-of-town \u0026#39Amazon tax\u0026#39Comment: Brexit has completely failed \u0026#39left behinds\u0026#39 angry with the dismal status quoThe grudges to watch as world leaders arrive for stormy G20 summitAngela Merkel to miss G20 opening after plane \u0026#39malfunction\u0026#39 forces unscheduled landing 2.4-million-year-old tools found in Algeria could upend human origin storyAirline apologises for staff who mocked five-year-old Abcde\u0026#39s nameFive dead and 32 injured in Hong Kong coach crashDrinking in pregnancy could be causing defects to one in six babies Fat-free shakes and soups: NHS pins hopes on liquid-only diet to reverse diabetesWizard of Oz beats Star Wars as most influential film of all time, study of 47,000 movies showsTheresa May under pressure to raise Khashoggi murder with Saudi Crown Prince at G20 summitSculpture made with 100,000 confiscated blades highlights UK knife crimeCairnGorm Mountain resort placed into administrationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/29/15/2film.jpg","title":"2 movie stream download torrent india block websites film","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The country has been launching intense crackdowns on pornographic and adult websites, to broad criticism.The pre-emptive order – which was given before the film was actually released, let alone made available online – is thought to be one of the most wide-ranging ever to be granted.As well as the wide breadth of the number of sites being covered by it, it is notable in that many of the sites covered had not actually started offering the film.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Investigators found no evidence that the hackers succeeded, but have not ruled out the possibility that they did steal some data, the company said.British Airways says huge cyber attack hit more people than realisedThey only sought customer names, email addresses and scrambled passwords, Dell said.The breach occurred as companies come under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide to provide quick and accurate disclosure of customer data theft. The European Union implemented strict new privacy regulations in May that punish violators with fines of up to 20 million euros ($23 million), or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher.Dell determined that there were no regulatory or legal requirements that it disclose the incident, but decided to come forward with customer trust in mind, according to the source.Dell declined to say how many accounts were affected, but did say that payment information and Social Security numbers were not targeted.Dell said it reported the matter to law enforcement.

Claiming that it will hurt families of already meagre living standards, he suggested that the policy could be similarly damaging to Theresa May as Poll Tax was to Margaret ThatcherA positive FASD screen was defined as problems with at least three different areas of learning or behaviour, with or without physical anomalies.These anomalies include growth deficiency and distinctive facial features, such as a thin upper lip and small eye openings.Up to 17 per cent\u0026nbspof those in the study screened positive for symptoms of FASD.Screening has taken place in the schools of some countries, such as the US, Canada and Italy.She is calling for further research to clarify the current prevalence of FASD in the UK.These children will have difficulties that will persist across their lifetimes, she added.\u0026nbspThere is evidence to suggest that if these iniduals are diagnosed early and if they and their families get appropriate support, they can achieve much better outcomes.Advice from the chief medical officers for the UK states that women who are pregnant or think they could become pregnant should not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to the baby to a minimum.It advises that the risk of harm is likely to be low if women have only drunk small amounts before they knew they were pregnant, or during pregnancy.Women who have consumed alcohol in early pregnancy should avoid further drinking, though the risks to their baby are likely to be low.Anyone who is concerned about alcohol use during pregnancy should talk to their doctor or midwife.Dr Raja Mukherjee, who runs a diagnostic clinic for FASD at Surrey and Boarders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: These are really important results that show there are likely to be many iniduals with this disorder already out there who are being missed.There seems to be a disconnect between these findings and what many clinicians often report as a rare condition.\u0026nbspIt shows that it is a disorder that is seemingly hidden in plain sight that we need to pay attention to.\u0026nbspUnless we start looking for it we will continue to miss it.If we fail to diagnose it then those affected iniduals will continue to be affected by a lack of support and have subsequent impact on them and wider service. These results can be the first step in helping us in the UK to realise it is no longer a condition we can ignore.Sandra Butcher, chief executive of NO-FAS UK, a charity to help those affected, said more support was needed on every level.Foetal alcohol syndrome compensation case goes before Court of AppealThis study shines light on a staggeringly widespread and largely avoidable public health crisis, she said.\u0026nbspNo policy maker who cares about the mental and physical health of the most vulnerable in our society should rest easy until we have in place UK-wide comprehensive action and training on FASD prevention, diagnosis and support that extends across the inidual\u0027s life.Babies with FASD grow into adults with FASD and more support is needed on every level.The Children of the 90s study, also known as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), is a long-term health research project.It enrolled more than 14,000 pregnant women in 1991 and 1992 and has been following the health and development of the parents and their children ever since.Clare Murphy, from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas), said: We advise real caution over the interpretation and communication of these findings.This study, as the authors themselves acknowledge, does not prove any causal link between pregnancy drinking and the developmental outcomes recorded, and may cause pregnant women and parents needless anxiety.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Cathy Adams, who started her love affair with Instagram in 2012, says the world is better when we’re connected to it, while Helen Coffey, who has never used it,\u0026nbsprefuses to tie her ego to her travelsClick to followThe IndependentBanning social media is a progressive idea, but does it bite the hand that feeds?Why we should all use Instagram on holidayIt all started on 3 January 2012.\u0026nbspThat was the date of my first ever Instagram upload. It was of a saucer of tea in some dingy burlesque club near Chancery Lane. It got zero likes – probably because who drinks tea at a burlesque club?\u0026nbspThings got better from there.5 April 2014: 11 people liked a picture of me posing with a giant frozen margarita in Tijuana. Nine people liked a picture of my feet standing on a glass floor on the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago a few months later. This summer, countless people commented on the braggy snaps of me swimming in glass-clear waters in the Males (because… Males).Disappointingly, only 48 people liked a picture of me at my wedding, whereas 137 liked a candid (ish) pic of me laughing with Gordon Ramsay at his Bread Street Kitchen in Hong Kong.Sarah Michelle Gellar ‘terribly sorry for fat shaming’ Instagram postYou always remember the numbers. As a natural egotist, uploading a carefully curated snap to the channel and watching the likes roll in makes me feel all kind of zippy. After all, these Instagrams have timestamped my life since 2012.That’s not to say that Instagram doesn’t often behave. The bad things are myriad: waiting for Instagrammers to take pictures of your pancakes at brunch, or then artfully arranging your coffee and sunglasses and Moleskine around a cold plate of eggs. Trying to enjoy the pink-purple-blue sunset on Bali’s Seminyak beach and finding you have a row of Instagram screens blocking the view. Or the ninth circle of Instagram hell, which is queueing for a snap of Santorini’s sunset or for the small-time sunflower field in Canada which banned visitors thanks to Instagram overload.These are bad things, but it doesn’t mean Instagram is a Bad Thing: even if the Vienna Tourism Board currently thinks differently.Its current campaign “See Vienna, not #Vienna” is asking tourists to “see the city behind your pics”. It’s a progressive idea, particularly because so much destination marketing rests on the halo effect on social media. (Although its Instagram page, endorsed by almost 100,000 people, is still asking snappers to share ‘Vienna pics by including #ViennaNow’.)\u0026nbspSome Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole the platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantageIt’s a clever campaign, but one that rather bites the hand that feeds. Some Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole\u0026nbspthe platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantage.Mostly because of the staggering number of users. More than one in eight of us globally have Instagram. Users upload 400 million Instagram Stories a day. There are commercial gains, too: more than 72 per cent of users have bought something they saw on Instagram, according to Business Insider. For a tourist board, this provides a rich seam of free (free!) content, even if many of the snaps don’t deserve to be hung on the mantelpiece. Even the Vienna Tourism Board isn’t above using Instagram indirectly to promote its new campaign.Few people argue that being more connected than ever before – through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even, howl, LinkedIn – is a bad thing. After all, it’s the primary reason so many people travel: they want to be connected to another world. Instagram facilitates that, albeit virtually. When I lived abroad, Instagram was one of the many platforms I had at my disposal to give a sneak flavour into my life in Asia. (Instagram was for delicious food pictures, Twitter was for snark.) It was also useful when I didn’t want to have janky Skype calls with friendseditorsmy mother – they could simply check into my Instagram to figure out where I was and what I was looking at.103rd floor of the Willis TowerFor journalists, no platform can be discounted: we need all the tools we can get to understand our audience. And if our audience is on Instagram, then we need to be on Instagram too. Especially working in travel, where spectacular images are so important to help sell a destination (alongside, ahem, fantastic words). Personally, Instagram has given me work opportunities I wouldn’t have found elsewhere: I’ve been commissioned to write features based on the destinations I’ve tagged myself in via Instagram, although I’m still waiting for a blurry photo of a cityscape to be bought by a picture editor…That brings me on to my next point: Instagram is great for meeting new people and picking up tips. Often I’ve geotagged myself in a particular destination and locals have messaged me about some cool new restaurant, a must-visit tea shop, or even offered to meet up for a beer to show me around. A photo I posted of the rust-red National Museum of Cambodia last year prompted a friend to message and say she was in Phnom Penh at the same time – and did we want to grab a Khmer beer later?\u0026nbspThen there’s the inspiration side of Instagram. I once organised a bucket-list trip to Tanzania based on a photo so flat-out spectacular that I knew I’d have to see it for myself. A journalist I followed (in the days before influencers) had snapped a picture of herself in an infinity pool at a safari lodge in the Serengeti, overlooking a watering hole. And so two weeks of annual leave was booked around visiting that particular lodge. I didn’t get the same shot (or even want to) but watching elephants bathing in the water while lazing in a cool kidney pool was every bit as blockbuster as the Instagram snap promised. And really – how is booking a holiday based on an Instagram post any different from flicking through an analogue Thomas Cook catalogue?Travellers forget that Instagram is also practical, because it’s real-time information. The app holds a mine of data. How big are the queues at Anne Frank’s house in Amsterdam? Check Stories tagged at that location. What is the weather like for a weekend trip to Berlin – are people snapped in light jackets or thick coats? Is it currently bucketing it down in Hong Kong? All you have to do is check out a handful of the 95 million (ish) posts per day.Yes, unplugging from Instagram while on holiday might mean you notice how gorgeously rococo Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace is. But by snapping an Instagram of it, you’ve given yourself a memory to return to again and again. The world is better when we’re connected to it. And in this miserablist world, sometimes it just helps to have a nice picture to look at.Why we should all take a leaf out of Vienna’s book and unhashtag our livesGazing out over the picturesque expanse of Lisbon from my hotel’s rooftop bar, its pastel-shaded, higgledy-piggledy buildings interspersed with verdant trees, I try to take it all in. The sky, amber-hued as the sun sets the Tagus river and accompanying Ponte 25 de Abril, sparkling roguishly in the distance the storybook-perfect Castelo St Jorge, set high upon a hill in all its glory. I look and look and look – but I don’t reach for my smartphone.Yes, ladies and gentleman – I may be the only travel writer on the planet who doesn’t have Instagram. I’m not alone but I certainly seem to be in the minority friends and colleagues never fail to meet my app absenteeism with disbelief.“But you go to all those amazing places!” they say. “It’s such a waste!”My standard response is a curt, “I don’t like taking photos or looking at other people’s.” Which usually stumps them.They’re right in one respect. I do get the opportunity to visit some phenomenal spots – luxury hotels with infinity pools, white sand beaches lapped by cobalt waves, Michelin-starred restaurants with tasting menus so damn good I feel drunk on decadence. (Do you hate me yet?)Yat Sen Memorial ParkMuch of it is Insta-heaven, just begging to be caught, captioned and catapulted onto the internet’s favourite photo-sharing platform. But, while I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognition.And now there’s at least one place which won’t expect that of me, one place that actively discourages such behaviour despite the allegedly increasing influence of “Instagrammability” as a factor in people’s holiday choices.Vienna’s bold new tourism campaign, Unhashtag Vienna, is targeting the social media generation with a simple message – put down the smartphone and enjoy the moment instead. Signs reading “See Vienna, not #Vienna” are there to greet visitors at the airport and, for the month of November, the tourist information office on Albertinaplatz will be giving out instant cameras with just 10 shots. The aim is that tourists spend less time snapping and more time actually experiencing.While I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognitionIt might seem antagonistic to some but to me it’s plain refreshing. I salute Vienna for both their innovation and bravery in daring to suggest that perhaps there might be a better way to see a city than through a screen.Long before I became a travel writer I started to resent the impact smartphones had on travel – and on all activities, come to think of it. Dining with a friend and them only half listening while I shared my news, their attention far more invested in an ever-changing news feed going on trips where I had to repeatedly wait out of shot before I could sit down as colleagues secured the desired pic watching the sunset, my view marred by a hundred obtrusive, winking camera phones. I could go on.I’m not Amish. Of course I recognise that social media isn’t without its blessings and benefits. There’s just something about it that seems to suck all of our attention, vampire-like, in a deeply uncomfortable way. And there’s something about the aspirational quality of Instagram that sells us a dream – particularly when it comes to travel – filtering out the ugly, the uncomfortable or the just plain boring, until all that’s left are the bright and shiny parts. It kind of sets a place up to fail. How can the reality ever live up to the over-saturated promise? How can a “bucket-list destination” ever be more than a slight disappointment?Travel influencers also have a lot to answer for when it comes to promoting “bad behaviour” to get the money shot. Just this month, blogger and influencer Patricia, otherwise known as One Ocean Away, was called out for posting a picture of herself walking on railway tracks while a train travelled towards her – some said it could encourage others to emulate her in a more dangerous setting.Of course, all that’s only half the story. Truth time: what really freaks me out about Instagram is the idea of how closely tied my fragile ego would be to my travels.It would be nice to think that, when we post things on social media, it’s done merely for the pleasure of sharing our lives and connecting with others we just want to be part of that big, beautiful conversation.YangonIt would be nice – but it wouldn’t be true. For most of us, it’s the endorphin rush of seeing those numbers climb – follows, likes, shares, comments – that keeps us coming back for more. Whether we like it or not, we are all approval junkies for whom those figures are inherently bound up in our self-worth. In the era of the ubiquitous selfie, it seems inevitable to associate thousands of likes with the idea that thousands of people like you and, conversely, that a dearth of interactions means you’re essentially an online pariah.It happens on every platform, but Instagram is one of the worst offenders when it comes to making us feel our value can be measured numerically – particularly as statistics show that pictures with people in tend to perform better than those without. Ergo, people are judging you as much as they are the backdrop, whether it be Kyoto’s bamboo forest, Santorini’s blue-capped buildings or Singapore’s rooftop infinity pool.Blac Chyna under fire for promoting skin bleaching creamHailey Baldwin appears to confirm marriage to Justin BieberNick Jonas opens up about having diabetes in candid Instagram postTo be frank, I just don’t think I could hack it. I can already see how things would go – here’s me enjoying that Lisbon skyline. Here’s me honing the shot to find the best angle, filtering it so the buildings really pop, cropping out the messy table in front of me. Here’s me posting it. And, several hours later, here’s me checking it, and rechecking it, and rechecking it, ad infinitum, to see how many interactions I’ve had. I ignore the sweeping landscape before me I ignore the cocktail in my glass I even ignore the person sitting opposite me. I don’t need a crystal ball to see my inescapable Instagram future.Instead, free from such constraints, I’m able to live – not just in the moment, but in the place. I devour the view with my eyes, rather than observing it second hand. I savour each sip of my velvety espresso martini.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As James Moore\u0026nbspexplains, it wouldn’t be the first example of a team machinating its own demiseClick to followThe IndependentThe Raiders’ defeat by the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month triggered much adverse commentThe Raiders are officially tanking,” declared USA Today’s Touchdown Wire last month. It’s not the first time this has been suggested by those covering the NFL for a living in response to the\u0026nbspteam’s dismal season.The contention that there’s nothing accidental about the losing streak is based on the notion that a lowly position in the final NFL standings this season\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspsecure a favourable position in next year’s NFL draft. It allocates the first pick from each year’s pool of eligible players from the college game to the worst team, and then proceeds in reverse order, with the Super Bowl winner going last in each of seven rounds. Just over 250 rookies, many of considerable quality,\u0026nbspare selected in this manner.While no one from the team would admit it, and certainly not coach Jon Gruden\u0026nbsp(who indeed has flatly denied it), the suggestion that the Raiders are “tanking” was hard to dismiss\u0026nbspduring the 34-3 loss to the crosstown San Francisco 49ers at the start of November.Baseball players race to capture escaped ducklingsIt was a truly dreadful performance. Michael Wilbon, one of the hosts of ESPN’s talk show Pardon the Interruption, was moved to describe it as “the worst I’ve seen” from one of the league’s marque franchises.Having followed the Raiders for more than three decades, including through some very rough seasons, I couldn’t disagree.Gruden is the returning prodigal son, a man who\u0026nbspumpteen teams, both college and pro, had been trying to tempt back into the game from the broadcast booth.He was head coach during the construction of the last truly successful Raiders roster. That squad\u0026nbspwent to the Super Bowl in 2002, but ironically Gruden\u0026nbsphad by then been traded by the late Al Davis, the team’s mercurial owner, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And the Bucs won that game.Gruden got one of the rings traditionally handed to the winners, but critics sniffed that he did it with the team of his predecessor, Tony Dungy, who himself\u0026nbspwent on to win it all with the Indianapolis Colts.Bent upon moving the Raiders franchise to Las Vegas, Davis’s son and successor as team owner Mark needed to make a splash and create some excitement. He did it by re-signing\u0026nbspGruden\u0026nbspin January, courtesy of a reported 10-year, $100m deal that is unprecedented for an NFL coach. The package offered Gruden the chance to do things\u0026nbsphis way.With the sort of security no other NFL coach has, the man nicknamed “Chucky”, after the horror movie character,\u0026nbspfor his facial expressions during games\u0026nbsphas set about tearing apart a team that went 6-10 in 2018\u0026nbspbut had made the playoffs the previous year.Gruden during the NFL Football game between Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers in November (RexThurman James)Homegrown stars such as defensive wrecking ball Khalil Mack, one of the league’s best players, and the talented, if inconsistent, receiver Amari Cooper, were traded away for future draft picks, with the team fielding a combination of ageing castoffs and ultra green rookies this year.Mack wanted a monster extension, which he got from the Chicago Bears, his new home. Cooper, now with Dallas, would soon have been after a new deal of his own. Their departures, and other moves, have given the Raiders considerable head room under the NFL’s salary cap to spend in free agency. But this year’s team is a mess, and there were times when it looked like the players had quit on their coach during the Thursday night debacle in San Francisco. The Raiders made the 49ers rookie quarterback Nick Mullens, who had gone undrafted and had never started a game, look like 49er legend Joe Montana.Could the critics have been correct? Were the Raiders\u0026nbspthrowing away a season to make themselves competitive for their projected 2020 arrival in the city of sin?The idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples, perhaps the most infamous being the ‘Disgrace of\u0026nbspGijon’ in the 1982 football\u0026nbspWorld CupThe result of the trades is that the Raiders have not only accumulated spending money they also have an impressive five picks in the first round of the NFL draft over the next two years.The position of the Raiders’ traded future\u0026nbsppicks from the Dallas Cowboys and the Chicago Bears will be determined by the\u0026nbsprecords of the latter two teams. The better they do with the help of the Raiders players they have acquired, the worse the return to the Raiders will be (and the Bears look like a lock for the playoffs, with the Cowboys in with a decent shot).The Raiders’ own picks, however, will be determined by the team’s record, and after losing to the LA Chargers on 11 November\u0026nbspfollowing the 49ers debacle, they were in pole position for the top slot and a shot at another defensive wrecking ball, Nick Bosa, the Ohio State Buckeyes product, and brother of Chargers star Joey Bosa. He sits at the top of the draft boards of most experts.It’s hard to see Bosa being as good as Mack. It’s hard to see anyone being as good as Mack. But the advantage with Bosa is that he will be stuck on a relatively cheap, league-mandated rookie deal for four years, with an optional fifth.If Bosa is the man the Raiders are after, it’s easy to see how they could win by losing.There was a similar case a few years ago, when quarterback Andrew Luck was coming out of Stanford, and was seen as an even more desirable commodity – a can’t-be-missed quarterback. A team prepared to “suck for Luck”\u0026nbspwould, it was said, be set for years. The Colts won that derby, and jettisoned legend Peyton Manning as a result. Luck has been decidedly unlucky with injury, but he has looked incredible this year, and easily worth the pain of the two-win, 14-loss\u0026nbspseason the Colts endured before getting him.Created with Sketch.The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the YearThe idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples. Perhaps the most infamous in what Europeans call football was the “Disgrace of Gijon” in the 1982 World Cup.Having played all its group games, Algeria had four points (at the time it was two for a win). Two of them came from the shock of the tournament when the north African side beat West Germany 2-1, the other two from a 3-2 victory over Chile. The intervening game was a 2-0 loss to Austria. With West Germany having thrashed Chile, a complex situation was created ahead of the final game between the Germans and\u0026nbspAustria. The upshot was that they could both qualify and prevent Algeria from becoming the first African side to reach the knockout stages if the Germans won by either one or two goals (a third would push Austria out).After a 10-minute barrage Horst Hrubesch found the back of the net for West Germany. The rest of the game was a depressing spectacle, with lots of passing taking place in the two teams’ own halves, and an almost complete lack of any effort to find a goal. The crowd cried foul. Actually, they cried “fix”!Both teams denied collusion and Fifa considered no rules to have been broken, but from the 1986 World Cup onwards the final pair of group matches has kicked off at the same time with the aim of preventing a repeat.Hrubesch celebrates scoring in West Germany’s controversial 1982 win against\u0026nbspAustria\u0026nbsp(RexColorsport)Cricket is a sport in which accusations of match-fixing regularly crop up, mostly as a result of players allegedly manipulating the outcome of games (or specific in-game elements) to the benefit of gambling syndicates.But teams have been known to do it for their own advantage too. The most notorious incident of this type came when Somerset captain Brian Rose declared his side’s\u0026nbspinnings closed after just six balls during a match in the early\u0026nbspstages of the one-day format\u0026nbspBenson \u0026amp Hedges Cup of 1979. Rose had worked out that his team would qualify for the second round from their group as long as they weren’t overtaken on strike rate, which was the formula in use for splitting teams at the time (it has since been replaced by net run rate)\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspirrespective of the result of the specific match.Unfortunately for the county, the game’s administrators intervened, calling an emergency meeting that led to Somerset’s expulsion. The rules of the game were subsequently changed to prevent declarations in one-day games.It isn’t just at the top level that the sort of shenanigans deemed “just not cricket”\u0026nbspoccur either. The supposedly genteel world of village cricket has seen it too, and in more recent times. Last year Carew Cricket Club made headlines nationally after declaring at 18-1 during their Pembroke County Cricket Club title-decider against second-placed Cresselly. They were 21 points clear, with 20 available for a win. But their opponents could potentially make up the gap through batting and bowling bonus points if they were to win handsomely.Man beaten to death in baseball bat attack‘10 out of 10’ drunk smashed guitar over sleeping mamba user’s headTo prevent this from happening, Carew closed its innings early, losing the game but winning the title by ensuring no bonus points could be scored. A Twitter storm ensued\u0026nbspand a disciplinary panel was set up, leading to Carew’s relegation to a lower ision, a fine and a ban for the team’s captain. But Carew kept the title. So they could still be said to have won by losing.In addition to the potential of securing an advantageous draft position –\u0026nbspand all the big four US sports of American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey operate a variation on the draft theme –\u0026nbspit’s the absence of any\u0026nbspthreat of relegation that facilitates throwing away not just a game but the entire season in US sports. At least in theory.It might seem extreme to do it, but if you’re not a top-of-the-table contender\u0026nbspthere’s nothing to lose and everything to gain for a “rebuilding”\u0026nbspoperation. It’s more or less accepted practice in baseball\u0026nbsp(where around half the professional teams are essentially building for the future)\u0026nbspto throw in the towel come the end of July, at which time Major League Baseball imposes a trade deadline.The truth is that losing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players doTeams with no chance of making the end-of-year playoffs regularly swap their stars for prospects from contenders’ minor league “farm”\u0026nbspsystems. The Boston Red Sox got a pitching ace (Chris Sale) from the Chicago White Sox for four prospects in 2017, and a closer, Craig Kimbrel, from the San Diego Padres for another four in 2016. Those two were important parts of the team’s world series run this year. No one’s complaining about what the Red Sox gave up in return. Meanwhile the Padres lost 96 of their 162 games and the White Sox 100. The problem with “tanking”\u0026nbspfor tomorrow is that tomorrow doesn’t always arrive. It doesn’t matter how many prospects you accumulate if they don’t work out.The NFL draft is no more certain to improve your team than baseball prospects are. It’s a crapshoot, and although some are better than others at finding hits, Gruden’s record at Tampa wasn’t great.There is, however, a postscript to the story. The Raiders found themselves in Phoenix, Arizona on Sunday 18 November, facing the Cardinals, another struggling team in rebuilding\u0026nbspmode and with no chance of making the playoffs. Gruden’s men won a thriller courtesy of a field goal in the last second\u0026nbspthat was set up by a drive engineered by quarterback Derek Carr. Such comebacks were a hallmark of his during the 2016 playoff run.In so doing, the Raiders arguably hurt themselves, dropping from first to third in the notional draft order.\u0026nbspThey lost by winning. One headline writer said they were even managing to screw up tanking.But the truth is that\u0026nbsplosing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players do. The\u0026nbspraucous celebrations in the visitors’ locker room after the game showed how much victory meant. The members of the Raider nation who made their way out into the desert to watch were similarly delighted. Gruden looked pretty happy too.As the late, great Al Davis said: “Just win, baby.”\u0026nbspBecause winning’s much more fun.Still, the season isn’t over. And the road ahead will be a rocky one. The Raiders proved that by getting blown out by the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. The remaining schedule sees the team facing the potentially Super Bowl-bound Kansas City Chiefs (twice), the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Denver Broncos in the weeks to come.It isn’t hard to see them losing the lot\u0026nbspand still having a very realistic shot at that first pick in next season’s draft. The tank\u0026nbspis still more or less on track.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Other notables include Jimmy Cliff and Toots and the Maytalls.Artists such as the Clash incorporated its chunky beat and its politics into their own music, bringing it to a wider audience. It caught on from Britain to Brazil and Africa.Created with Sketch.Bob Marley and the Golden Age of Reggae Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Its contribution to international discourse on issues of injustice, resistance, love and humanity underscores the dynamics of the element as being at once cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual,” UNESCO said in a statement.The Paris-based UNESCO, the cultural agency of the United Nations, made its ruling at a meeting this week.Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta,\u0026nbspReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.Rooney\u0027s book also landed a spot on\u0026nbspthe Man Booker Prize shortlist this year and has been a huge word-of-mouth hit, Waterstones fiction buyer Bea Carvahlo told .Normal People\u0026nbspis slated to be adapted\u0026nbspby the\u0026nbspBBC\u0026nbspas a drama series.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang. This is our ultimate goal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It has been gradually expanding, but must ensure all of the vast library of songs it has are able to be played in each inidual countries, requiring agreements with all the major record companies.In India, that is even more complicated, since technology companies must account for the large number of languages and the relatively small number of people who use a credit card.Many other international streaming services, including Apple Music and Amazon, are already available in India.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But by the time he achieved that year’s stunning double-punch of Jurassic Park and Schindler’s List –\u0026nbspthe latter of which had its world premiere 25 years ago this week – the director was already Hollywood’s undisputed miracle-worker, operating at a level far beyond even his most acclaimed contemporaries.Perhaps that’s why the audacity he demonstrated filming and releasing two wildly different, equally boundary-breaking blockbusters within 12 months of each other passed almost without mention. He had carried off the apparently impossible – and the world considered it more or less banal.\u0026nbspJurassic Park has long been considered both a popcorn classic and towering feat of filmmaking. The dinosaur romp to rule them all ushered in a new era of computer-generated effects. Loud, dazzling, occasionally terrifying, it is arguably second only to Jaws in the countdown of Spielberg’s great thrill rides.\u0026nbspBut as it marks its quarter century, Schindler’s List surely stands as the more impressive achievement. It respectfully honours the victims of the Nazi genocide, yet is also a riveting drama, with Ralph Fiennes, as real-life concentration camp commander Amon Goth, one of the most skin-crawling villains in recent cinematic history.\u0026nbspThe Holocaust movie had been Spielberg’s ultimate grail for decades. It was all the way back in 1982 that he was first alerted to the true life story of Oskar Schindler, the gadabout Moravian industrialist who, during the Second World War, saved the lives of an estimated 1,200 Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow by putting them to work in his factories.Yet Spielberg fretted for years that he was too flashy – too much a creature of Hollywood – to do justice to a real story about real suffering. Only after turning 40 and enduring relative failures such as The Color Purple and Hook – the lukewarm reviews of which cracked his wunderkind reputation – did he feel at last prepared to tackle the greatest challenge of his professional life.\u0026nbspDern and Sam Neill in ‘Jurassic Park’ (Rex)Jewishness was complicated for Spielberg. He was raised by Orthodox parents in Phoenix, Arizona. But growing up “ethnic” in the American sun belt in the Fifties and Sixties was not straightforward, as he was reminded on a daily basis.\u0026nbsp“People coughed the word ‘Jew’ in their hand as they passed me in the hallway,” he told The New York Times. “Pennies were thrown at me in the study hall in a very quiet room of 100 students ... We couldn’t stop it. So my mom picked me up in her car every day after school and took me home.”He was very familiar with the Holocaust throughout his childhood. “We lost cousins, aunts, uncles ... My life has always come back to images surrounding the Holocaust,” he would recount. “The Holocaust had been part of my life, just based on what my parents would say at the dinner table.”\u0026nbspSchindler’s List’s journey to the screen was long and tortuous. The original Thomas Keneally nonfiction book, Schindler’s Ark, was inspired by a chance conversation the author had in 1980 with the owner of a leather goods shop in Los Angeles.Leopold Page’s real name was Poldek Pfefferberg: he was one of the “Schindler Jews” saved by Oskar Schindler. Upon discovering Keneally was a writer, Page insisted on sharing the entire tale – “the greatest story of humanity man to man”.\u0026nbspKeneally was hooked and, working initially from documents furnished by Page, assembled his eventual bestseller. But when Hollywood sought to option Schindler’s Ark it ran into problems. Page had been attempting to turn a spotlight on his saviour for decades and, in the Sixties, sold the rights to his version of events to MGM producer Marvin Gosch for $50,000.\u0026nbspThat project eventually sputtered out, but not before Gosch had hired Casablanca co-writer Howard Koch to write a script and interview Schindler Jews around LA. Spielberg, for his part, was alerted to Schindler’s Ark as he was toiling on ET. His mentor Sidney J Sheinberg, then president of MCA, gave him a copy of the Keneally tome. “It’ll make a helluva story,” Spielberg supposedly responded. “Is it true?”Neeson in ‘Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Reluctant to bring Schindler to the screen himself, Spielberg instead touted the idea to his old movie-making pals. Roman Polanksi and Brian De Palma said no, but Martin Scorsese expressed an interest and was eventually attached to direct. Then, surrounded by pirates and clockwork crocodiles on the set of Hook, Spielberg had an epiphany.He had, he believed, matured sufficiently as a filmmaker and was ready to adapt Schindler’s Ark. Indeed, it was arguably the undertaking towards which his entire career had been leading. All he had to do was win back the rights from one of the greatest directors of his generation.\u0026nbspAcross town at the Beverly Hills HQ, home to the almighty CAA agency, a Holocaust biopic was the last thing on the agenda. CAA’s co-founder Michael Ovitz, however, had a dilemma he would have regarded as no less pressing than Spielberg’s desire to wrest back ownership of Schindler’s List. How could he persuade Steven Spielberg, Hollywood’s most unassailable hit-maker, to sign with him?\u0026nbspHe had an idea – and it hinged on proposition his old friend Michael Crichton had brought to CAA. Ovitz and Crichton were close, the agent having shielded the author and director from prurient attention when he went through two years of devastating depression. Now Crichton was gung-ho about a new concept for a novel – to be set in a theme park where genetically engineered dinosaurs go on the rampage.\u0026nbspHow Jeff Goldblum stole the first Jurassic ParkSpielberg beat James Cameron to Jurassic Park film rights by hoursIt would, Ovitz immediately appreciated, make for a cracking read – and an even better movie. And who better to direct that the doyen of rip-roaring family entertainment, Steven Spielberg? He wasn’t representing Spielberg – who famously did not have an agent at that time. But with a little persuasion, Ovitz hoped to remedy the situation and have Spielberg both make the movie and sign with CAA. Thus Ovitz would have landed the biggest fish in Hollywood.\u0026nbsp“We offered Jurassic Park exclusively to Steven Spielberg – who still hadn’t signed with CAA,” Ovitz writes in his autobiography, Who is Michael Ovitz?. “Steven was the one director Michael and I knew who possessed both the technique and the sense of wonder to pull the plot off. Playing favourites on this one would alienate a lot of our other filmmakers, but it was worth it.”Spielberg blazed through the (still unpublished) novel in a single evening and, for the first time in his career, attached himself to a picture that was unfinanced and had yet to receive a studio green light. At that moment, the only people in on Jurassic Park were Crichton, Ovitz, Spielberg and his producing partner Kathleen Kennedy (today, dark lord of Disney’s Star Wars franchise).\u0026nbspOvitz next called Sheinberg – the very mogul who had introduced Spielberg to Schindler’s Ark a decade previously. He explained to the producer, now honcho-in-chief at Universal, that he had “good news and bad news”.In any other industry, the scenario would have seemed farcical. In Hollywood, it was business as usual. Spielberg wanted to make Schindler’s List but Scorsese held the rights. Sheinberg, who had turned Spielberg onto Schindler’s List, wanted to make Jurassic Park – but Spielberg and his collaborators had it in their back pocket. Meanwhile, Spielberg was attached to a mooted remake of the 1962 Robert MitchumGregory Peck thriller Cape Fear – a project he was keen to pass on to Scorsese, despite his old pal’s strict “no-remakes” rule.\u0026nbspScorsese\u0026nbspinto swapping ‘Schindler’s List’ for ‘Cape Fear’ (Rex)This being Hollywood, a solution beneficial to all parties was hammered out. Spielberg talked Scorsese into swapping Schindler’s List for Cape Fear – the carrot being that he could cast Robert De Niro as the villain played in the original by Mitchum and thus reunite with his favourite actor. Meanwhile, Universal agreed a complicated profit share with Ovitz, Spielberg and Crichton. They would walk away with nothing if Jurassic Park flopped – but enjoy a lucrative slice of the box office should it do well.\u0026nbspSheinberg also agreed to let Spielberg adapt Schindler’s Ark, even assenting to a three-hour running time, black and white photography and a comparatively hefty £23m\u0026nbspbudget. There was a\u0026nbspcaveat, though – he had to do Jurassic Park first.\u0026nbspAs 1992 began, Spielberg was thus juggling two remarkably different undertakings. He’d decided to forgo a fee for Schindler’s List. Payment for telling the story of the Holocaust would, he felt, be tantamount to “blood money”.\u0026nbspHe also had to find his Schindler, and rejected pressure to cast a star (Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson both auditioned). Warren Beatty talked his way into a script reading – but was ultimately rejected because, according to Spielberg, he would have ended up with Oskar Schindler-as-Warren Beatty rather than the other way around. In the end, he went with the comparatively unknown Liam Neeson, who had impressed Spielberg in a Eugene O’Neill play on Broadway.An even bigger headache was bringing realistic dinosaurs to the screen. Spielberg had assumed early on that Jurassic would utilise “go motion” – an updating of the ancient “stop motion” effects as featured in King Kong and immortalised in the Fifties and Sixties by the “creature features” of Ray Harryhausen.\u0026nbspThe creator of “go-motion” Phil Tippett – celebrated in Hollywood for creating the Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes Back – was hired and test sequences of the famous T rex and velociraptors-in-the-kitchen scenes were shot. Spielberg’s children were entranced when he showed them the footage. Yet something nagged at the director. King Kong was 60 years old. Surely technology had moved on?\u0026nbspEnter Industrial Light and Magic, which presented Spielberg with a primitive CGI showreel of a walking T rex. Even in rough form, it was many times more realistic than go-motion. Spielberg turned to Tippett and quipped:\u0026nbsp“You’re out of job.”\u0026nbsp“Don’t you mean extinct?” Tippet shot back – a line Spielberg put in the script (Tippett stayed on as “dinosaur supervisor”).Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Filming on Jurassic Park had wrapped but special effects were still unfinished when Spielberg arrived in Krakow in March 1993 for the 72-day Schindler’s List shoot. He had put himself under time pressure because he wanted to make the Holocaust movie in the bleak Polish spring. He could, it is true, have waited another year. But he feared that if he delayed (and especially if Jurassic Park flopped), the studio would reconsider bankrolling his passion project.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List was intensely personal for the director –\u0026nbsptraumatic simply by dint of the subject matter. Day after day, he would recreate the horrors of the Krakow ghetto and of the nearby Płaszow concentration camp, presided over by monstrous SS second lieutenant Goth (Fiennes’s mere presence in a Nazi uniform is said to have reduced Holocaust survivors to tears on visits to the set).\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspat night\u0026nbspSpielberg would communicate via satellite uplink with Industrial Light and Magic in San Francisco. Here, he was required to make final decisions over how the T rex ought to roar and whether a brachiosaurus should rise on its back legs when eating. It was difficult and depressing – and Spielberg grew to resent Hollywood for putting him through the mill in such a fashion.\u0026nbsp“When I finally started shooting ... in Poland, I had to go home about two or three times a week and get on a very crude satellite feed to northern California ... to be able to approve T rex shots,” he remembered at an anniversary screening of Schindler’s List at Tribeca Film Festival.\u0026nbspOne of his methods of coping was to call Robin Williams, whom he had befriended making Hook. Never one to refuse an audience, Williams took it as his mission to cajole Spielberg out of his blue moods.\u0026nbsp“Robin knew what I was going through, and once a week, Robin would call me on schedule and he would do 15 minutes of standup on the phone,” Spielberg said. “I would laugh hysterically, because I had to release so much.”Neeson (Rex)With laughter and determination, he got through it and achieved one of the remarkable one-twos in film. Released on 11 June 1993, Jurassic Park became the monster that devoured the box office whole, earning nearly $1bn. Of that, Spielberg pocketed an estimated $250m\u0026nbspthanks to the deal Ovitz had thrashed out in pre-production.\u0026nbspAnd then, on 15 December, Schindler’s List opened in US cinemas, revealing a very different side to Hollywood’s great conjurer. (It would open in the UK in early 1994.)\u0026nbspThe movie was powerful, haunting and lacking the trademark sentimentality that Spielberg for so long feared made him temperamentally ill-suited to directing it.\u0026nbspBoth films were universally adored. The New York Times praised Jurassic Park as\u0026nbsp“a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen”. The Independent approved, too: “The best thing about Jurassic Park is the way that fear never drives out wonder, wonder at the special effects that have realised dinosaurs so convincingly, but also at the dinosaurs in their own right,” it said.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List received an even more positive response. “Schindler’s List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history,” said The Independent. “It is one of the cinema’s finest achievements.” “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again,” added The New York Times.\u0026nbspJurassic Park and Schindler’s List went on to clean up at the Oscars the following year. Jurassic Park won for best sound editing, sound mixing and special effects. But this was eclipsed by Schindler’s List, which finally lifted the Academy Awards curse that had hung over Spielberg since ET was trumped by Gandhi a decade previously.\u0026nbspAmong the seven Oscars awarded to it were ones for Best Film and Best Director. Yet far from exulting, James Cameron-style, in his sweep, Spielberg cut a sober figure. The presence beside him on the podium of producer Branko Lustig – who as a child had spent two years at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen – was a reminder there were more important things than accolades and ovations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Even more concerning is that these figures are likely to just be the tip of the iceberg because many cases of FGM go undetected.”\u0026nbspAs many as 100,000 women and girls in the UK are estimated to have undergone the illegal procedure, but a fraction of that number have disclosed it.FGM victim and Dahlia Project founder on the culture of the practice within family groupsNHS England statistics show that 1,015 FGM cases were newly recorded between April and June this year, although the procedures may have been performed many years before.It brings the total number of survivors recorded in the UK to 17,330 since 2015, but a study estimated that 137,000 women and girls who have migrated to England and Wales are living with the consequences of FGM. \u0026nbspPolice operations have focused on preventing girls being taken abroad to undergo the procedure, but a survivor previously told The Independent that “cutters” are also being flown into the UK to carry out procedures to order.FGM, which refers to any procedure that intentionally alters female genital organs for non-medical reasons, has been illegal in the UK since 1985.\u0027My sister was screaming\u0027: FGM survivor fighting to end practiceThe law was strengthened in 2003 to prevent girls travelling to undergo FGM abroad and it is also illegal to fail to protect a girl from the practice.But there have not yet been any successful prosecutions under the law and police are instead using hundreds of FGM prevention orders to protect girls at risk, amid education campaigns hoping to stop the practice.Isatou Kramar, an FGM survivor who lives in Essex, said parents from practicing communities are pressured into putting their daughters through the procedure in the belief it is a cultural tradition or religious requirement.The 32-year-old underwent the procedure with her sisters and cousin in Gambia when she was seven years old.She told The Independent children at her school called her names because she was considered old for FGM and that by the time a cutter was organised she was “keen to have it done”.Ms Kramar added: “As a child you see the tradition and you want to follow it, not realising that is abuse. Most victims don’t realise they are victims … it took me a long time.”Created with Sketch.FGM tribal circumcision ceremony in Baringo County  Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

reasons they do it is to stop women from experiencing sexual pleasure,” Ms Kramar added.“People believe it is hygienic, and there is also the fact that in the culture you are not regarded as a woman unless you go with the procedure.”Ms Kramar, who now has three daughters, said the birth of her first child triggered memories of the pain she underwent and she resolved not to do the same to them.The mother said an imam at her youngest daughter’s naming ceremony told her FGM was not in the Quran, as believed by some practicing communities, and she believes religious education is key to ending the abuse.Anita Lower, the Local Government Association’s lead on FGM, said the figures showed the “worrying prevalence of FGM, which is ruining lives and destroying communities”.“As this crime is under-reported, the true incidence rate of FGM is likely to be higher,” she added.“At a time when they should be preparing for adult life and enjoying being young, no girl or young woman should be subject to the horrors of genital mutilation which is child abuse and cannot be justified for any reason.”Ms Lower said councils, police, the NHS and charities were working hard to prevent FGM, but that stretched children’s services department to the scale of demand for help.Girls \u0027being pressured into FGM in UK playgrounds\u0027, survivor warns“Long-term funding for the National FGM Centre is also needed for its vital, specialist work in communities to prevent FGM in the first place, and to develop expert knowledge to build relationships with families which can safeguard against this horrific kind of assault,” she added.Social workers are starting new “episode of need” cases for more than 1,000 children each day, more than half of which are for reasons of abuse or neglect.\u0026nbspAn extra £410m for adult and children’s social care in 201920 was announced in the recent budget, with a further £85m over five years to expand programmes in 20 areas.The Local Government Association welcomed the funding but said it did not go far enough to plug a £3bn funding gap they say is facing children’s services by 2025.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big

I have a medical report and they asked why it was in English, but that’s normal in my country. I don’t know how I can prove to them that my story is true.”Responding to the figures, Diane Abbott MP, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: “This is deeply concerning. Ministers need to offer an explanation as to why there has been a drop in protection offered to those in an already vulnerable position, who may be seeking asylum on the basis of their sexual orientation.”Liberal\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves hit the British coast as Storm Diana approaches, in Portreath, CornwallDuke and Duchess of Cambridge stand with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (left), the son of Leicester City\u0027s chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his mother Aimon watched by Leicester City players (right) as they pause after laying flowers during their visit to the King Power Stadium in Leicester, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the October 27 helicopter crash at the stadium.

Claiming that it will hurt families of already meagre living standards, he suggested that the policy could be similarly damaging to Theresa May as Poll Tax was to Margaret ThatcherLiberal Democrat peer Lord Scriven said Home Office officials were in some cases\u0026nbspstating that applicants were\u0026nbspnot LGBT+\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspmerely to justify a refusal in order\u0026nbspto meet the requirements of their ministers – something he said\u0026nbspshould never be allowed to happen.\u0026nbspHe added: The Home Office may have good policy on paper, but it is clear the practice is both humiliating and completely unacceptable. This process sees too many LGBT+ applicants ordered back to countries where they are at risk of persecution or in some cases death.\u0026nbspMany iniduals who I speak to seeking asylum on the grounds of their sexuality or gender identity are in disbelief how they are treated by the Home Office.\u0026nbspI urge the Conservative government to establish a dedicated unit to handle asylum applications, outside the Home Office and free of political interference. These inhumane and degrading practices must come to an end immediately.”Leila\u0026nbspZadeh, executive director of UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration group (UKLGIG), said the decline was “extremely worrying”.\u0026nbspShe added:\u0026nbsp“Our research has shown that the Home Office routinely disbelieves\u0026nbspLGBTQI+ asylum claimants and disregard statements from friends, partners and organisations testifying to a claimant\u0027s sexual orientation or gender identity.\u0026nbspThe Home Office is setting the bar too high for\u0026nbspLGBTQI+ people.

I’ve worked out that you could plan and hold a referendum in 22 weeks. “My\u0026nbspcalculations show that we could get through the work of passing legislation, we could get through the work of the Electoral Commission working out the right question... we could do that in 22 weeks. “We could actually, after this vote on 11 December, hold a referendum, potentially, on 30 May\u0026nbspnext year.“We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article 50, I’ve suggested, by four months to 29 July.”How an EEAEFTA Brexit model would solve Theresa May’s problemsWhy Nick Boles’ Norway model for Brexit is no plan B at allBBC reveals date for live Theresa May-Jeremy Corbyn Brexit TV debateMark Carney defends Bank of England over ‘Project Hysteria’ claimsNo-deal Brexit will damage security in Britain, minister to sayThe EU has been clear that “if Britain needs a few more months to resolve the route forward, we would be able to have that”, she said.Ms Greening said it was not “heresy” to delay Brexit, adding: “Given this decision is going to shape the coming decades, I think we owe it to ourselves and to future generations to get it right.”Her comments came at a People’s Vote event, where former Tory ministers Jo Johnson and Lord Willetts spoke in favour of the “Conservative case” for a new referendum.Mr Johnson, who\u0026nbspresigned in protest at Ms May’s Brexit plans, warned that the Tories could lose all credibility if they pursue the prime minister’s plan, and clear the way for a Labour victory at the next election.He said: “Brexit is seen as a project driven by the Conservative Party and this half-baked worst of all words Brexit could trigger an electoral defeat on the scale of 1997 or worse, this ‘Tory Brexit’ label will be an albatross around our necks for years to come.”Mr Johnson said he even agreed with Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, and his own brother Boris Johnson, that the prime minister’s plan would leave the UK as a “passive recipient” of EU policy.It comes after EU leaders endorsed the prime minister’s blueprint at the weekend, clearing the way for a Commons showdown on 11 December, where scores of Tory MPs\u0026nbspare expected to vote down the deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchWith Labour and the other opposition parties also opposed, shadow chancellor John McDonnell gave his strongest hint yet that Labour would\u0026nbspback a second referendum, saying it could be “inevitable” unless there is a general election.However Ms May\u0026nbsptold a committee of senior MPs on Thursday that seeking an extension to the\u0026nbspwithdrawal process\u0026nbspwould cause the agreement would fall apart.“Any second referendum that would be held, if that were the case, would not be able to be held by 29 March next year. You would have to extend Article 50,” she told the Commons Liaison Committee.“What is clear is that any extension to Article 50 – anything like that – reopens the negotiations, reopens the deal. At that point, frankly, the deal can go in any direction.“We would simply find ourselves in a period of more uncertainty, more ision in this country.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We have been discussing debate formats with both parties and will announce further details soon.”The BBC One schedule on the Sunday carries hits such as Doctor Who, the Strictly Come Dancing results show and Sir David Attenborough’s new series, Dynasties.If the debate aired straight after the Strictly semi-final results show, it could be boosted by the 9.6 million viewers already watching the channel.Verhofstadt predictsAn hour-long 8pm slot would also avoid a clash with the I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final, which airs at 9pm on ITV.But it was in part the broadcasting of the reality TV show that led Mr Corbyn to say he backed the commercial channel’s proposal.“It reaches a wider audience and the timing looked good to me because it’s not inconveniencing people who want to watch other things later in the evening.“One should always have respect for the viewers and also we want to get the widest possible audience.”Rik Mayall portrayal of politician from the late 1980s foresees Brexit rhetoricThe Labour leader’s team is also said to be more keen on the ITV version because of the format, with BBC apparently suggesting the head-to-head debate could be coupled with a separate panel of interested parties who would get to ask questions of the leaders.The ITV version meanwhile is said to be a cleaner, straight debate between Ms May and Mr Corbyn, with no one else involved.Downing Street and the leader of the opposition’s office are believed to have sat down with the four main broadcasters to hear their pitches before deciding on who to go with.Number 10’s preference is said to have been the BBC, as it was the most “rounded” and focused on the prime minister’s deal, not the wider political situation.The BBC had initially suggested the debate would take place on Thursday 6 December. But after Mr Corbyn’s office expressed a preference to go with ITV’s offer of a Sunday night broadcast, it offered to switch to Sunday as well.Downing Street was reportedly happy to go with that option, and it is now waiting for Labour to say whether it is willing to proceed. ITV said it has not ruled out holding its own debate.A spokeswoman said in a statement: “ITV will confirm its coverage plans for the week of the Commons vote in due course. As part of this, ITV has invited the prime minister and leader of the opposition to appear in an ITV programme. As always, it is up to those invited to decide whether they want to accept the invitation.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The departure of the UK from the European Union is a failure for everybody, for the UK, as for the EU.“Last Sunday was a sad day for both. So let us make the best of it, in the knowledge that once, in the near future there will be a new generation in Britain who will decide to come back into the great European family.”Polls and studies suggest that young people were significantly more likely to vote Remain than the older generation.Other senior MEPs speaking during the debate backed the deal. Elmar Brok, a German MEP from Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, warned Remainers in the UK that they would be taking a risk by rejecting the plan.Consumer confidence slumps to lowest level in a year due to Brexit No-deal Brexit will damage security in Britain, minister to sayGrim GDP forecasts as Corbyn ally says new Brexit vote ‘inevitable’“If there is no treaty then there will be no transitional period and it’s going to be an abrupt break,” he said.“It must be made clear that it is a very risky initiative for the Remainers, rejecting this and hoping something else is going to come, like a referendum – that’s a very risky business.”He added that the EU had “got the best deal possible”, adding: “Brexit is a very bad affair for the European Union and Great Britain – more for Great Britain, given its size, but it’s also a very bad thing for us as well.”Philippe Lamberts, a Green MEP who sits on the parliament’s Brexit steering group, said “no other Brexit is available” and that a no-deal Brexit would “make the UK a rogue state, a country whose signature with any other partner would amount to just nothing”.“The real choice is between Brexit under the terms negotiated and no Brexit at all,” he said, adding that the EU should allow Britain to stay in if it wanted to.Farage said negotiations were ‘game, set, and match’ to Michel Barnier (EbS)Former Ukip\u0026nbspleader Nigel Farage said: “I’m in no doubt that this withdrawal agreement is a good deal … it’s a good deal for the European Union. For the UK I think it’s probably the worst deal in history.“Mr Barnier, I have to say to you: I wish you were on our side, really. Because it’s game set and match to you. You probably can’t even believe your luck that you came up against a British prime minister who met every single demand of yours while at the same time trying to deceive the British public.”Mr Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, echoed his message from Sunday’s European Council summit to MEPs.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

There is no added value.”EU leaders signed off the withdrawal agreement, which has taken 18 months to negotiate, at a summit in Brussels on Sunday.

We’ve added over 700,000 jobs to the economy, with more people finding work than at any time in the past 40 years.“This upward trajectory shows no signs of slowing.”He is due to add: “The government has made clear that we want to take a balanced approach to the question of our future trading prospects.“We need to maximise our access to the EU market, but without damaging our potential to benefit from emerging trade opportunities in other parts of the world.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I think it is matter of trust in politicians that we then deliver on that vote.”The comments come after Ms May accepted that MPs will have the opportunity to opt for a People’s Vote, when her Brexit agreement comes to the Commons.During prime minister’s questions, she argued it would require an extension to the Article 50 period, beyond next March – but appeared to accept power rests with parliament. Labour’s John McDonnell has said he now views its support as “inevitable”.MPs will vote on the Brexit deal on 11 December, with the prospect of multiple attempts to amend it if – as expected – it crashes to a heavy defeat.Asked if she would stay on to deliver a fresh referendum, if backed by MPs, she replied: “I’m very clear that I don’t think there should be another referendum.”Asked a third time to rule out resigning in those circumstances, she said: “I’m focusing on the result of the vote.”The prime minister also refused to accept that defeat was now certain, with almost 100 Tory MPs having spoken out in opposition, saying: “We haven’t had the vote yet.”She was urging MPs to recognise that her deal delivered on the referendum result “in a way that protects the union, in a way that protects jobs, in a way that protects our security”.Ms May also turned her fire on Labour for opposing the ‘backstop’ plan she has struck with Brussels to prevent the return of a hard border in Ireland.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The increase in arrears per claimant averaged £586 for the 2016 group and £309 for the 2017 group.“The evidence shows that, even 15\u0026nbspmonths after claiming universal credit, those affected were consistently underpaying rent due,”\u0026nbspthe report says.“For now, the government must acknowledge that the current system is unworkable and broken.

Despite their huge range, the waves were apparently not felt by anybody. However, one person monitoring the US Geological Survey’s live stream of seismogram displays did notice the unusual waveform and posted it to Twitter, sparking the interest of other geologists and earthquake enthusiasts.Volcano of Fire eruption sends boiling rock flying almost two milesTwitter user @matarikipax posted the waveforms, describing it in the first instance as “a most odd and unusual seismic signal”.It was not only the power of the seismic waves which puzzled scientists when they began to examine the readings, but also the curiously regular shape of the waveform.In a typical earthquake, the rapid crash of a tectonic plate movement sends out what is known as a “wave train”, composed of several types of waves moving at different speeds from the epicentre of the quake.Seismographs measure the fastest waves first (the primary or P waves), which arrive in an abrupt cluster, then the secondary (S waves), and finally, rumbling along later, come slower low-frequency surface waves. In a powerful quake, these can move across the surface of the planet several times.The wave pattern seen on 11 November resembled these slow-moving waveforms usually seen following large earthquakes - only, in this case,\u0026nbspthere had not been a perceptible earthquake.At least 700 people injured after 6.3-magnitude hits western IranUnderwater tremor was most powerful earthquake to strike NorwayFracking earthquake laws could be relaxed to encourage drillingThe bizarre waveform is what scientists call “monochromatic”. Earthquakes normally produce waves of so many different frequencies, the wave readings appear more jumbled.But the mystery waveform from Mayotte was a crisp zigzag, which repeated after steady 17-second intervals.“They\u0027re too nice. They\u0027re too perfect to be nature,” joked the University of Glasgow’s Helen Robinson, who is study for a PhD in applied volcanology.Speaking to the National Geographic, she added the location of the island means industrial sources for the unusual wave - such as oil drilling or from wind farms -\u0026nbspcould be ruled out. Founder of UK Earthquake Bulletin (UKEQ) Jamie Gurney, who was among those who began looking at the waveform, saying\u0026nbspon Twitter he had “no idea if a similar global signal of this nature has ever been observed”.So what could cause these regular slow waves? Could it have been a meteor strike? An illegal weapons test? Previously undiscovered sea monsters? Mayotte lies between Tanzania and Madagascar (Google)Despite the mystery, scientists do have clues as to the cause of the seismic event. Mayotte, an inhabited French island, was formed as a result of volcanic eruptions around 4,000 years ago, but since then, the area has largely remained volcanically inactive.However, since May last year, the island nation has been rocked by hundreds of earthquakes, all of which have emanated offshore and the largest of which measured 5.8 on the Richter scale. The island is believed to be moving about two inches southeast each year.But in recent months, seismic activity has declined, and on the 11 November, no traditional quakes were detected. According to the National Geographic, analysis by the French Geological Survey suggests the new activity may point to huge movements of magma beneath the earth’s crust, miles offshore and under thousands of feet of water.Large movements of liquid rock, or reverberations through the magma chamber can cause waves similar to those measured in this instance.GPS measurements of Mayotte’s slow movements indicate a magma body measuring about a third of a cubic mile is pushing through the subsurface, and this could be the source of the weird waves.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Firefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March .A group of aviation experts assembled for the Australian TV programme  Minutes, broadcast in May .They claimed they may have solved the aviation mystery.They all agreed that Shah deliberately ditched the plane in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.Former Australia Transport Safety Bureau head Martin Dolan added: This was planned, this was deliberate, and it was done over an extended period of time.Simon Hardy, a pilot and instructor, discovered the captain made an unexplained and strange turn to fly over his hometown of Penang.He also claimed Shah dodged Malaysian and Thai military radar by skirting along their borders.But aviation expert has rubbished claims made in the documentary that the pilot of doomed flight MH gently landed the plane in the Indian ocean.Christine Negroni said analysis of pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March  — meaning the plane was out of control when it hit the water.A British video producer has claimed to have found the missing plane on Google Maps.On September , , tech sleuth Ian Wilson claimed to have spotted the doomed jet lying in a high altitude area of the Cambodian jungle.While images from Google Maps do show the outline of a large plane – this could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.But Ian is convinced of his findings and says he intends to visit the site to solve one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.China used Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area but the firm claimed there was no sign of any plane.More recently, experts debunked a conspiracy theory that suggested the plane could not have sunk in the ocean as victims phones were still ringing.Many relatives were able to hear a ringing tone for up to four days after the crash.But wireless analysts claim that phone firms sometimes use a phantom ringing sound when the device is not active."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427557360.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"peoples vote second brexit referendum campaign","story":"The group was established in April  by four MPs and the actor Sir Patrick Stewart.The campaign group was launched at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, London, on April , .Attending were the MPs Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Layla Moran and Caroline Lucas as well as Sir Patrick Stewart and the comedian Andy Parsons.Outspoken Remainer Lord Adonis was also involved.The campaign is collaboration between several groups, including the European Movement UK, Open Britain and Britain for Europe.It is calling for a “final say on the Brexit deal”.The Peoples Vote organised a March For The Future on October  from Park Lane to Parliament Square.Organisers claimed around , people attended the march although the police declined to estimate the numberPreviously, the People’s Vote organised a march for June ,  from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square in central London.Attending the event were Gina Miller, Vince Cable, David Lammy and the actor Tony Robinson.Yes. The group wants to have a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.Superdry founder Julian Dunkerton recently gave £million to the campaign.He said: “I’m putting some of my money behind the People’s Vote campaign because we have a genuine chance to turn this around.I’ve got a good instinct for when a mood is going to change and we’re in one of those moments now.It’s becoming clear there is no vision for Brexit and the politicians have made a mess of it. Increasingly, the public knows that Brexit is going to be a disaster.”Labours Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said the party would inevitably back a second referendumthey were unable to force a general election.He added though that forcing a general election would be hard to do because of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist leader, has said she and her ten MPs would not vote for a second EU referendum but did not rule out supporting a Norway-plus option.Prime Minister Theresa May dismissed calls for a second referendum two years after the public voted to Leave.She said giving in to the demands would be a gross betrayal of our democracy.The PM said the coming months were critical in shaping the future of our country,  adding that she remained confident that the government could strike a good deal.But in the event of a no-deal, Britain would be readywe need to be and go on to thrive, she said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everything would be settled. But we’re not going to get a deal.We’re going to get a withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship will not be determined until after we’ve left the European Union.That is not what the British people were promised that is not what they voted for.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and has been threatened with eviction in the meantime.She told The Sun Online: “I couldn’t even afford a loaf of bread this week - my family had to give me money and cook for us.“It was my daughter’s birthday and I had to borrow the £ she was given.“I feel so guilty, I haven’t got another option.”Joanne, who can’t walk far because of her illnesses, had to visit her job centre several times to provide reams of proof before she got help - and had to beg for lts from family and friends to get there.Her husband previously sorted out her finances, but has now moved out of the family home leaving her and their two kids Hannah, , and Zoe, , behind.Joanne, who lives in the West Midlands, is just one of hundreds of Brits who say that going onto Universal Credit has pushed them into debt.In last month’s Budget the Chancellor announced a raft of measures to help ease their struggle - but they won’t come in for months.New DWP Secretary Amber Rudd has vowed to “fix” the problems with the flagship benefits system, which rolls six payments into one.Last week she even hinted she could slash the five-week wait to try and help those who are desperate waiting for their first payment.Joanne’s got letters and phonecalls saying she is almost £ in debt on her rent alone - and could face eviction from her houseshe doesn’t pay soon.She opted for a £ advance to help her while she waited but soon struggled with making ends meet.“I’m struggling to pay for anything including food for my girls,” she added.“I’ve been worried to death, I haven’t had anything to eat some days.“I’ve been going around to my family to get food - it makes me feel so bad.“Dad paid for us all to come over with a taxi so we could have a meal.”After waiting five weeks for her benefits to come through, she is now set to get around £, a month from UC - and her PIP disability payments are paid on top ofBut it was the “huge struggle” of waiting for it all to come through which really put a strain on the family, she said.Joanne’s former partner used to do everything beforehand for her, adding: “I never really did any shopping - or even had a bank account.”She’s slashed her bills to the minimum amount she feels is possible but still is struggling to pay the bills.“Universal Credit has been a nightmare, the benefits system should have been left how it is,” she added.“It’s caused me so much trouble and stress.”A DWP spokeswoman said: “We offer advances of up to  per cent of the first Universal Credit payment to help people who need extra support, and we’ve announced a £m partnership with Citizens Advice to support vulnerable people with their claims.“Other benefits, such as Personal Independence Payments, are available for people with mental and physical health conditions to help with additional costs.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004516094471-e1543445105186.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain needs brexit leaders steve hilton opinion","story":"It says: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”When you look at the shambles Brexit has become, as far as Britain is concerned it’s not a possibility but a downright certainty.Let’s review the idiocy.It began with David Cameron stomping off in the biggest and most ruinous huff in history, leaving a sleep-deprived and shell-shocked Tory party scrambling to find a new leader overnight.Then Boris Johnson and Michael Gove threw away a golden opportunity as potential PM and deputy to achieve the vision of a positive, outward-looking, go-getting, post-Brexit Britain.Over a bizarre few days they stabbed each other in the back, shot themselves in the foot and indulged in whatever other self-harming metaphor you can think of.Their antics landed us with hapless and hopeless Theresa May, so desperate to prove she could deliver Brexit despite opposing it that she rushed into announcing the end-point without the faintest idea how to get there.More misguided Remainer pandering came from then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with her ludicrous plan to force businesses to list their foreign workers.This offensive announcement alienated Remain voters who might have given Brexit a chance and helped set in stone the horrible isiveness of the past two years.As Foreign Secretary, Boris made one gaffe after another, starting with the most heinous: Sticking to his silly remark about having your cake and eating it — guaranteed to wind up the EU bigwigs and make them even more determined to give Britain a rotten deal.On and on the idiocy has gone — from Philip Hammond trying to prove his discredited Project Fear predictions were right all along by being the most anti-businessConservative Chancellor anyone can remember, to Matt Hancock’s hysterical claims about people dying from a lack of medicineswe leave the EU without a deal. He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative. Unite to get rid of TheresaMay, then make the case with passion and conviction for a clean break and a radical pro-enterprise programme.Right now, Britain needs leaders.

The notes of a music instrument – whether it’s grave or very pitchy – depends on the size of the instrument.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452689555.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"boa contrictor lincolnshire escaping owner house","story":"Police have warned the public to stay away from Draco — with its keeper admitting the snake could be deadly.The panicked owner, known only as John, said: “We couldn’t believe our eyes when we saw Draco wasn’t there.“Snakes are clever animals and it was very intelligent to escape the way he did.

He need only have explained to fellow passengers that he was finding the flight uncomfortable, rather than knowingly subject himself to an injurious event.In my view, his statements were his statements were intended to increase the size of the claimed encroachment and to create an exaggerated picture, rather than a genuine account.I accept that the passenger in seat J was a large man, both in the sense that he was very tall, broad, and carried signicant body weight. It is likely that there were occasions when, as a result of his size or his movements within his chair, that he did cause an inconvenience to Mr Prosser.But I do not accept the suggestion that his size was such that Mr Prosser was compelled to sit in an awkward way for the duration of the flight by virtue of him encroaching upon his seating area.The judge added that Mr Prosser had unrealistic expectations of how much room he should have had given the class of cabin he chose.The self-employed civil engineer had told the court earlier this month that he chose not to leave his seat because doing so would hassle the other passenger getting up, and did not take issue with him because he seemed self-conscious.Mr Prosser described the man as being ft in and weighing approximately  stone, and claimed he reminded him of late New Zealand rugby union player Jonah Lomu.He said: He was that large that he had to force his buttocks between the arm rests of the seats.He sat with his knees wedged against the seat in front and the rest of his body was overspilling into my seat by some inches.Mr Prosser, from Penygraig in Tonypandy, South Wales, said the incident in January  left him with a continual back spasm and an injury causing the sacroiliac joint at the bottom of his spine to dys.He said he had been unable to work overtime for three months as a result of his back pain, and it had left him lacking energy which had affected his relationship with his partner and forced him to give up mountain biking.Jack Harding, representing Mr Prosser, said a figure of £, had been submitted for the loss of earnings claim.Chris McLindon, the customer service manager on board the flight, said in a witness statement that Mr Prosser did not seem to be in any discomfort and at times he was asleep.Following the verdict a spokesman for British Airways said: We are pleased that the court agreed that Mr Prosser had room to fly comfortably.Our cabin crew will always do their best to make sure all our customers have a smooth journey, and in this case provided extra pillows and blankets to help Mr Prosser sleep."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook messenger down uk europe","story":"Thousands of users say they have been unable to launch the messaging app.Many of the app users say that the issue has been going on since this morning, with many others being angry at the app.Some technical issues on the app appear to have stopped displaying when users are online, others are experiencing dficulties receiving notications.Many frustrated app users took to Twitter to express their annoyance at the apps performance.One user tweeted: I cannot see active friends on messenger.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mark Carne, who stood down as Network Rail chief this summer, received a CBE at a Buckingham Palace for services to the rail industry. Yet he was in charge in May during the timetable change meltdown that caused turmoil for weeks. The Office of Rail and Road said NR’s punctuality and reliabshyility had hit “lowshyshyest levels since the current five-year control period began in ”. The regulator blamed the new timetable and extreme weather and ordered NR to raise its game and deliver an action plan within three months.   ORR’s John Larkinson said: “The evidence we’ve collected suggests NR is failing to take all reasonable steps to effectively manage performance and recover from incidents on its network. This is a capability issue which must be addressed urgently.” The Department for Transport admitted the CBE timing was “unfortunate” but said the issues should not detract from Mr Carne’s record.

Dog collar-wearing Revered Lynn appeared on the flagship show to fiercely defend Theresa May, urging viewers to “have faith in the government”. She is the pastor for a tiny organisation called the Seeds for Wealth Ministries, which claims to “help you realise, release and walk into your financial freedom in Christ”. However eagle-eyed viewers spotted that a woman who appears to be the same person regularly works as an extra under the name Marina Hayter - and was even in in Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens.  The broadcaster denies the claims. In a tweet, Newsnight said: Claims that Lynn appeared on #newsnight as a paid actor are .

Twitter is awash with theories that the BBC hired her to appear on the show – leading to “Vicargate”.  Labour peer Andrew Adonis even waded in. He tweeted that “Lynn is a pastor and I am the Pope” before calling her a “fake pastor” and accusing the BBC of “a reign of lies”. Many other agreed with him. One viewer said: Reverend Lynn is in fact Marina Hayter. She has played numerous roles including Peasant Woman, quizzical librarian and shocked neighbour but no vicars until her starring role as Brexit deal fan girl.  Another agreed: WTF! This lady playing Reverend Lynn is actually an actress called Marina Hayterwho is a professional TV talk show guest. In other words, she was hired by @BBCNewsnight to say she backed Mays plan. This kind of undemocratic deception has to have consequences! But Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis accused Lord Adonis of “peddling fake news”. She tweeted: Not in this day and age.

The EDL founder is organising a protest just two days before parliament votes on Theresa Mays deal.

McDonnell praised Momentum for “leading the way” in opposing a “newly energised, well funded network of hate”, saying that “the working class of Britain have a proud history of beating the far right” and that “this history must continue”. He also called on the labour movement to be “front and centre” in opposing the far right. The march has been organised by Momentum and a coalition of partners including London Young Labour, Labour Against Racism and Fascism and the Stop Trump Coalition.  In the past two months, Momentum has mobilised for both a counter-march to the Democratic Football Lads Allianceas well as a central London unity demonstration opposing fascism and racism. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, said: “This march isn’t about Brexit, it’s about far right extremists dressing up in suits and pretending to be respectable.

Matthew Offord became lucky number  as he confirmed: as the deal stands at the moment, I will vote against it. The arithmetic was already tricky for Theresa May after the DUP, who prop up her minority government, indicated they could vote down the deal. That is because they believe the Prime Ministers deal will create a border down the Irish sea. While the majority of Labour MPs,  Lib Dems and the -strong SNP will also vote against. Even those Labour MPs who were wavering, such as Gareth Snell who represents Stoke Central and Lisa Nandy in Wigan, have now said they cant support the PM.  May has tried to reach out over the heads of MPs by touring the country this week to drum up support for her plan.

Mrs May refused to sayshe would allow the country to crash out without a dealher plan was voted down by Parliament despite warnings from the Treasury and Bank of England that would be economically disastrous. She suggested it would be in the hands of MPs as to what happened next. “The timetable is such that actually some people would need to take some practical steps in relation to no deal,” she said. Askedshe had drawn up a Plan B in the event she lost the vote, she replied: “The deal is the deal at this point of time.” The Prime Minister told the committee that a second referendum would lead to the collapse of any Brexit deal. “Any second referendum that would be held,that were the case, would not be able to be held by March  next year. You would have to extend Article ,” she said. She added: “To extend Article , actually you are then in the business of renegotiating the deal. “What is clear is that any extension to Article  - anything like that - reopens the negotiations, reopens the deal. At that point, frankly, the deal can go in any direction. “We would simply find ourselves in a period of more uncertainty, more ision in this country.” Today the chair of the Brexit committee Hilary Benn revealed he had tabled an amendment to the meaningful vote.The amendment, which has the backing of five committee chairs, opposes the deal, rejects a no deal Brexit and would enable the House to express its view about what should happen nextthe Prime Minister’s deal is defeated.

The push for another EU poll was backed by ex-minister Jo Johnson who said it could have a healing effect. Ms Greening said thatPrime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit deal is voted down by the Commons on December , organising a new referendum could begin immediately. She said: Ive worked out that you could plan and hold a referendum in  weeks. We could actually, after this vote on December , hold a referendum, potentially, on May  next year. We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article , Ive suggested, by four months to July . Ms Greening insisted the necessary legislation could be passed during the time frame and the referendum question could include three options remaining in the EU, leaving on the terms of Mrs Mays agreement, or leaving without a deal. The ex-Cabinet minister said voters could list their choice in order of preference, as in mayoral elections. Ms Greening said voters had to decide on the issue because they were tired of a Game of Thrones-style approach to Brexit in Parliament. Speaking at the same event in London, Mr Johnson - who quit as transport minister earlier this month in protest at Mrs Mays Brexit agenda - said a new referendum could have a positive impact on the country. Mr Johnson said that a new referendum would allow the Government to concentrate on domestic issues.  He said: Some say giving the public the final say will tear the country apart. In fact, I believe an honest debate in light of the experience we have all had as a country over the last two-and-a-half years could be part of a necessary healing process that will allow us toto the agenda the PM herself so eloquently outlined on the housing crisis, our poor social mobility, our poor productivity. Mr Johnson, whose brother is arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, urged MPs to vote against Mrs Mays deal as it was a worst of all worlds Brexit and bad for the country and the Tory partys election chances. The ex-transport minister said the Conservatives risk an election disaster on the scale of they back Mrs Mays plans. He said: Both the deal and no deal would be disastrous for our economy. The Conservative Partys reputation for economic competence would be undermined by implementing a botched Brexit, especially one that the Governments own analysis suggests will cause economic harm.

The Prime Minister confirmed she will meet the Gulf royal, one of the UKs key Arab allies, at the G summit in Buenos Aires. Experts claim the Prince has blood on his hands over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, who was allegedly beaten to death and dismembered in Turkish outpost of the hardline regime. The -year-old vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October  to obtain a marriage document. His body has not been found – and the CIA believes the Prince would have given the green light for the assassination. But Riyadh insists he knew nothing about plans for the killing. Campaigners have also blasted Britains relationship with Saudi over arms sales from the UK, including weapons used by the Saudis in the civil war in Yemen.  Mrs May revealed: “I am intending to speak with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. “The message that I give will be very clear, its the message that we have consistently given on this issue of Jamal Khashoggi, but also on the issue of Yemen. “In relation to Khashoggi we want to see a full and transparent investigation into what happened, and obviously those responsible being held to account. “On issue of the Yemen, we continue to be deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation. “The long term solution for the Yemen is a political situation and well be encouraging all parties to work for that.”  Jetting into South America on her RAF Voyager plane, Mrs May will become the first UK PM to visit Buenos Aires, which is a ,-mile round trip from London. Tony Blair visited Argentina in  but did not go to the capital. Officials expect Argentinian President Mauricio Macri to raise the Falkland Islands in talks with Mrs May. But,  years after the two nations went to war over the South Atlantic archipelago, the PM is set to back the islands right to remain British. However, she is not expected to make a ,-mile detour to visit the overseas territory before ing to London on Sunday.  In a fresh sign in the thaw in relations between London and Buenos Aires, the leaders are expected to announce the first UK trade envoy for the country. Ministers hope they will spearhead a push to boost trade with Latin America, which has  million people and a combined GDP of .trillion. Mrs May will also use the summit to convince counterparts of her EU withdrawal pact, which has been attacked from all sides in the UK.  She said last on Thursday night: “The Brexit deal we have agreed sets a path for the UK to a brighter future. “The announcement of a new trade envoy for Argentina and progress in transitioning our trade agreement with Chile show that we are already taking signicant steps to boost trade in fast-growing new markets. “We have strong links to build on – British energy companies are on the ground in Argentina, working to develop local energy sources, while financial services firms supports the funding of these projects to expand Argentinian infrastructure. “In my discussions with President Macri we will be exploring how we can develop this further for the prosperity of both our countries.”  In wider talks, she will urge reform of the World Trade Organisation, where the UK will take its seat after Brexit. Meanwhile, an unlikely attempt to arrest the Prince in Buenos Aires could be launched, it was claimed. A write from the campaign group Human Rights Watch calls for his prosecution over war crimes in Yemen and Mr Khashoggis murder. Argentinian prosecutors are said to be considering charging him over mass civilian casualties in the civil war, and torture. A source from President Macri’s office refused to comment on the arrest request. They said earlier this week: “We can make no comment on that.  “All we can say is that Mohammed bin Salman’s attendance remains confirmed, we have received no contrary information so far.” But a spokesman for Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie admitted any attempt would be unlikely to succeed. “We don’t believe the court presentation by Human Rights Watch will prosper. Mohammed bin Salman will be protected by diplomatic immunity and he is also travelling in his official status as representative of a foreign head of state,” the spokesman said. “Besides, cases involving diplomatic immunity can only be decided by the supreme court and his visit will be too brief for it to reach the court. “So for the time being his attendance will go ahead as scheduled. The case is in the hands of the court and the government will not interfere with it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"universal credit leaves mum just","story":"NewsUniversal Credit leaves mum with just £ a month to pay bills and care for babyLucy Akdemir wont be able to afford her own food this Christmas because the hated benefit has left her family’s cupboards bareShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsLucy Akdemirs Universal Credit was halved in a single month\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOn the phone, Lucy Akdemir is in tears. Thousands of families like hers are facing a Christmas shycancelled by Universal Credit. But for the past year, her severely disabled dad Alan Oakman has been paying to buy a hamper for her young family so they don’t have to spend the festive season at the food bank. “My dad’s amazing,” Lucy says. “It means unlike so many others we’ll have something in the cupboards.” This week the Mirror received a moving letter from Alan, who lives in Swansea. “I am writing to you on my daughter’s behalf,” it said. “She was put on Universal Credit. This month she got a payment of pound, half last month’s amount. Her rent is pound a month. That leaves pound for her to pay bills and buy food for her and her baby.” Alan added: “I am severely disabled, in a wheelchair, unable to walk and nearly blind. It is very upsetting what this Government is doing to people. The way things are going, I really worry for her safety.” When I call Lucy, she is fighting back tears. “I’ve never been in this situation in my le, it’s degrading,” she says. “We waited seven weeks for Universal Credit.   What were we supposed to live on  Now, since I’ve been moved over, they’ve been taking more money off me and wanting more back. “You hear all these stories in the news of people taking their own lives. You can totally believe it. And you can see how people end up at the food bank. My son is two. I need to buy nappies, pay the household bills, pay the rent first to make sure we aren’t evicted. Where does the money come from for food ” While the political classes agonise over Brexit, the misery machine of Universal Credit rolls on into another festive season. The built-in five-week waiting period means anyone transferred to the hated new benefit after November  faces Christmas Day with empty cupboards. This week the Mirror revealed food banks are braced for their busiest Christmas ever because of the five-week wait and UC’s other deep problems. The Trussell Trust alone – which runs about half of the UK’s food banks – says it is expecting to feed . million meals to starving families, including a shocking , children. It’s not just the five-week wait. “My husband works as a barber,” says Lucy, . “I’ve always worked. But at the moment I’ve got a young child and I’m trying to get an Open University degree to better myself.” Her husband is Turkish and not classed as resident in the UK so he doesn’t qualy for UC. His earnings as a self-employed barber are taken into account, though, in Lucy’s payments. So, he is invisible for help, and visible when it comes to taking money away. The result has been a signicant loss in help since transferring from child tax credits and housing benefit. The DWP says that “Universal Credit payments reflect the earnings and circumstances of the entire household. No one needs to wait for their first payment as up to % advance payments are available from day one”.   But, of course, fear of debt prevents many people from borrowing what must be then paid back every month. Meanwhile, this week a group of single mums on Universal Credit shychallenged the scheme in the High Court for being “irrational”. Under UC, working parents are shyentitled to keep the first pound they earn within a one-month assessment period. But a problem happens when people get paid twice within the same calendar month – for example when there’s a bank holiday or over Christmas when wages may be paid early. When this happens, they look as though they are on double pay in the first month, so get little or no help, often due to the Benefit Cap. And in the second month it will look asthey earned nothing. So there’s no protected amount. Families also find the fluctuating payments impossible to budget for. In three cases brought by the Child Poverty Action Group, care assistant Erin Barrett has had to use food banks and twice tried to take her own le. Katie Stewart had to leave her job to find one with a pay date which suits the new system, and Claire Woods was left to rely on a food bank and forced to turn down a promotion at work. Meanwhile, Danielle Johnson’s lawyer, Tessa Gregory from Leigh Day, said the system left Danielle pound a year poorer. Danielle told the court: “I have never been this financially unstable before.” In interviews to mark her new job, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd claims that Universal Credit “really has transformed lives” in her constituency in Hastings and Rye.

We add to the display every year, and like to think we have a strong claim to being Britains most festive house.   Daughter Beth, who works at the Royal Bank of Scotland, explained how deep the festive spirit runs in the Gibbs family. She said: My dad has always been a big fan of Christmas. Hes a big kid really. It started when we were little with just two little snowmen and a Father Christmas. He started buying Christmas decorations during the sales, and over the years, the collection has just got bigger and bigger. We ended up having to buy another shed just to store it all.   The family have spent months preparing the arrangement at their semi-detached home in Benfleet, Essex, with Daniel even taking time off work to get everything ready. Beth said: My mum actually tries to stop him going to the sales to buy more things. Its become a bit of an obsession. I asked my dad how much the electricity bill goes up, and he didnt say.

Farmers are also warning that spuds, carrots, leeks and parsnips will be in short supply – and what is available could be smaller and more expensive than usual. Peter Thorold, who supplies sprouts to Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl, said the driest summer in his -year career has created a “crisis”. He said: “There’s going to be huge shortages. There will be a quarter less sprouts than last year. They’ve not been growing. “Other vegetables are also in trouble. There’s half as many potatoes as last year. Carrots and parsnips are the same, leeks are down.” Mr Thorold said his Lincolnshire business was pound, down on last year, adding: “There was one period when we had  days without rain. I knew then the Christmas supply would be dented.”   Rob Clayton from AHDB Potatoes said spuds had also been nobbled by the earlier cold snap.

In an interview with the programme, Ms Lovell said she wanted to believe Hawthorn did not pose a threat. But he had portrayed himself as a strong man who had previously raped women and was obsessive about Ms Lovell. These werent a couple of cards that came out of the blue, there were four years of cards before that, that were just filthy, she said. Then suddenly there were these two years of the threats, that just got progressively worse.  He would talk about how he was going to do it and it was very physical and so in my mind he was sexually aggressive, misogynistic, strong and frightening. Ms Lovell and BBC security teams contacted Avon and Somerset Police in January , after the rape threats began. Images of the greetings cards Ms Lovell had been sent were circulated, as well as examples of the handwriting inside them. They were usually signed Gordon with five crosses and often had an animal pictured on the front, which was regularly a cat.  When askedshe ever believed officers would track down the author of the cards, Ms Lovell replied: We all knew it was a real long shot. It was kind of frightening as well because Ive got this image of a big bloke who could see this when its being shared and he could suddenly act out on all these threats, all these things he was going to do - that hed been close, he knew where I was - so there was a real threat for me. Im thinking whats going to be his reaction .  It was a long shot but it was shared so much on social media and actually Ive got to thank everyone that shared it because thats how he ended up being arrested. It was just amazing that it came to that finally, to that conclusion.  Ms Lovell appealed to other victims of stalking to talk to somebody, as well as to write about their experiences in detail. Lovell, who has been presenting on BBC Points West since , also worked on Brainteaser on Channel Five and a live shopping channel. She urged anyone in a similar situation to act.

Some time after am...occupants attempted to evacuate they were exposed to high concentrations of smoke, carbon dioxide and possibly cyanide.” But it was “not impossible” to use it throughout the night, some doing so as late as am. However, some did not reach the stairwell as lobbies on each floor filled with toxic smoke from burning furniture around .am, the inquiry heard.

How the hell does that work  According to Royal insiders, it doesnt. Her personal assistant resigned, she calls people early in the morning, and *GASP* she made Kate cry at a dress fitting. If you believe the courtiers, Meghan is every negative clicheacute you can think of - the pushy American, the dficult orceacutee, the angry black woman, the uppity pleb, the Hollywood a. She doesnt understand the Royal rules, is a common refrain from anonymous sources, who go on to criticise the fact she wears trousers, black tuxedos, and has a distressing habit of not wearing a hat when the Queen is wearing a hat.Its almost like she didnt grow up PLANNING to be a princess, isnt it  If we take a cue from Wallis Simpson as the only previous American orceacutee to marry a Royal, it wont be long before someone suggests the new bride isnt even a female. There were long-whispered claims Wallis was a he, that she engaged in sado-masochistic sexual practices, that she had used her wiles to entice Edward VIII from his duty. So it cant be long before somebody - probably another Markle, considering their back catalogue - claims that Meghan once owned a pair of furry handcuffs and has Harry under her thumb. It all feeds into the narrative of there being a right sort of woman, and a wrong sort. The same happened with Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, with reams of coverage about their friendship, hen nights, falling-outs and, now, the eyebrow-raising living arrangements Sarah has with her ex-husband the Duke of York. But Sarah is seen as a harmless clown whos a bit of an embarrassment. Meghan is regarded more like Diana in her final years - so unprincess-like that shes a threat to the monarchy itself.   The best advice ever given to me was to judge people by what theyve done, not what is said. So lets look at Meghans achievements: . Years of hard work to achieve success in dficult industry . Financial independence . Survived a mostly-appalling family . Mostnot all of the in-laws seem to like her . Impressed someone who had his pick of the entire worlds female population . A clap less mental than Kates  On top of that shes privately visited the Grenfell Tower survivors, helped them raise more than pound, with sales of a charity cookbook, and just five months after marrying conducted herself on a two-week Royal tour of the South Pacic with grace and aplomb.

But body language experts analysed six police tapes showing Hoare and have pinpointed the moment the cracks began to show in her testimony.

He points out Hoare smiles as shes asked about Beckys disappearance, saying: This is what we call ‘duping delight’ it’s the thrill you get from getting away with a lie. Mr Lansley also says she is trying to give the impression of someone who is “helpful” and “doesnt quite understand the seriousness” of whats going on. He added that the movement of her shoulders indicates she is lying and that “the body is telling the truth”. Chillingly Mr Lansley also claims that Hoare, who was convicted of manslaughter and not murder, was the instigator of Becky’s killing.

They face the prospect of empty cupboards and a struggle to provide meals for themselves or their loved ones. Tesco wants to help people in need this Christmas so thats why its working with The Trussell Trust and FareShare to make this happen. Today the supermarket is launching its Food Collection campaign - the UKs largest food drive - and inviting customers to donate long-le food for those less fortunate. Its taking place in all Tesco stores across the country from today until Saturday December . And doing your bit is as simple as popping a few extra items to your shopping basket. All you need to do is take the shopping list below into your local Tesco store, pick the items you want to donate, and leave them at the in-store food collection point.  Tesco has also pledged to top up all customer donations by  per cent, so charities get even more help to pass on to those who can really benefit from it. Some stores collect for their local Trussell Trust foodbank, who deliver emergency food parcels to local people. Others collect for their regional FareShare depot, who redistribute to community groups and local charities. Donations to The Trussell Trust’s foodbank network go towards emergency food parcels for people who can’t feed themselves and their families. Items collected for FareShare are distributed to charities and community groups who provide meals for vulnerable groups like isolated older people or those in homeless shelters.  No matter where you donate, every can and every packet helps, and all the food you give will help people in need.

Rachael Knappier shared pictures of the swelling she suffered after the filler was allegedly injected into an artery. The -year-old was at a friends home with other pals when the treatment was carried out - but later rushed to hospital in intense pain. Botox parties are a growing trend in the UK, with procedures carried out in the comfort of someones home, rather than at a clinic.Rachael told The Sun she hadnt intended to have lip fillers done, but after alcohol started flowing she decided to have the cut-price work done.  She said she paid pound for Botox in her forehead and the lip fillers - which alone can cost pound in a clinic. Rachael, from Leicestershire, said she assumed the beautician was a nurse, but should have been wary after apparently not being asked to sign consent forms. She added: Within a few hours I began to feel unwell, my lips swelled like nothing Id ever seen before and the pressure was unbearable.   The beautician reportedly later Facetimed Rachael and advised her to go to AE, where medics confirmed it was not an allergic reaction. She had to have dissolving agent injected into her lips. Rachael said: “It was so painful, that my mum, who was sitting upstairs in a waiting room, could hear my screams. It has taken three months for her lips to go back to their normal size, and she said: “I would never go near a Botox party again.   If it had happened at a clinic, she said, medics would have known what to do.

The stunning house in St Lucia, Queensland boasts three enormous bedrooms, one bathroom, a garage, and a river view. An ad for the property, which appears on Realestate.au, reads: Perfectly situated on the bend of the Brisbane river, this is a unique opportunity to purchase into a tightly held community. Boasting uninterrupted views across to the CBD and beyond, this is ideally placed for buyers looking to downsize without compromise. But people on Reddit have noticed a glaring error in the photos, where locals are saying that the reality of the property is very dferent to the snap.  The brown snake [Brisbane River] hasnt been this colour for a long time, one user said. It appears that someone has edited the rivers murky waters into a stunning crystalline blue - which people think is hilarious as apparently the river never looks like that. An article by ABC last year even says that that experts agree on the reasons behind its murky colour - the fact its an estuary river has earned it the nickname the brown snake. Unfortunately for the photo editor, this fact hasnt escaped people on social media. Theyve also made some awkward mistakes - the blue colour that appears to have been used on the water has also been smudged onto a post on the jetty. Its overall not a brilliant Photoshop job.  One person on Reddit said: This is the best of all time and I have seen some terrible property Photoshop efforts. Another wrote: Funny thing is that the person who did that image has been meticulous in places but woefully lazy incompetent in others.Two of the three jetty pylons were removed from the selection before the colour adjustment the water around the railings was selected but not the railings themselves on that jetty.Vibrancy was bumped up too much as usual in these pics.

The low-frequency seismic waves were detected by monitoring stations across the globe on November  and reverberated for  minutes before falling silent. Researchers have narrowed its origin to Mayotte, a small island of the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The slow waves were similar to those typically seen after large earthquakes - but scientists have ruled that out as an explanation as no corresponding tremors were identied nearby. Other theories suggest that the noise could have been the result of an undetected meteor strike   While one researcher told MailOnline that the trembling was almost certainly caused by a low-level underwater volcanic eruption. But there is little evidence thus far to back up either claim as experts search for clues.I dont think Ive seen anything like it, Goumlran Ekstroumlm, a seismologist at Columbia University who specialises in unusual earthquakes, told National Geographic .The monotone ring was discovered by chance after after a New Zealand-based Earthquake enthusiast noticed unusual readings from the US Geological Survey.  The expert, who goes by the Twitter name @matarikipax, wrote: This is a most odd and unusual seismic signal. Recorded at Kilima Mbogo, Kenya. The signal can be seen all around the world.The post sparked a heated debate amongst the community as waves were detected in Chile, New Zealand, Canada and Hawaii. The unusual signal was immediately discounted as an earthquake because it lasted for too long and because of its global spread. Earthquakes usually release a quick flash of pressure as the built-up tension is released in seconds. The founder of founder of UK Earthquake Bulletin Jamie Gurney stressed that the vent was unique and said he had no ideaa similar global signal of this nature has ever been observed.  Others pointed out the region has seen a number of small quakes since a small . magnitude earthquake hit the region on May . There has been ongoing low-level seismic activity there since May, seismic expert Anthony Lomax told the Mail. Inflation deflation and collapse of volcano calderas, and movement of magma under a volcano can produce a wide iety of seismic signals, including long period and repetitive waves like those observed November . Scientist are now planning to study the areas complex geology for more information about the noise but have not yet been able to pinpoint its cause.

Estelle says she had bought a standard DIY hair dye from a supermarket in Val-de-Marne, on the outskirts of Paris. But social media in France was stunned when she posted faces of her reaction to PPD online. The allergy first caused her scalp to itch before the top of head started to swell up. Estelle attempted to treat herself using antihistamines and cream from a pharmacist but she awoke the next day to catch a glimpse of her inflated reflection.   Speaking to French news outlet Le Parisien, Estelle said: I could still see here I was struggling to breathe. My forehead had doubled in volume. My head was like a light bulb. She said that her tongue started to swell and she was rushed to hospital where the circumference of her head measured cm rather than the average . The teenager said she had previously suffered a mild reaction to hair dye and used the allergy test that comes with the product. But, rather than wait the recommended  hours, Estelle applied the dye after  minutes. Despite ignoring the instructions, her mum says there should be greater awareness of the PPD risks.   He mother said: “It’s true that she didn’t follow the instructions word for word but the warning has to be clearer. PPD, the abbreviation for paraphenylenediamine, is also used in high concentrations in the popular black henna tattoos. It is the prime cause of allergic reaction to hair dye and is needed for most shades of permanent colour, especially dark shades. There is a strict limit on PPD concentration at a maximum of  percent and the chemical is banned in other cosmetics.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13662436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS168584632.jpg","title":"ayrshire sands mark 30 years","story":"NewsAyrshire SANDS mark  years of support and prepare for Christmas bauble serviceThe voluntary group has been offering an invaluable support network to bereaved parents across the county for three decades.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsSANDS team Marion Boyd, Jenner Stamp, Sarah Spiers and Alison McNeil \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThat they are needed at all is a matter of huge regret. But to those within Ayrshire SANDS, a common bond and desire to unite burns bright. Behind this voluntary group for bereaved parents lies many a heartbreaking story. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death organisation is there, in the first instance, to reach out to those in desperate pain. As a support network, mums and dads who have been in the darkest of places are often the very people best placed to act as rocks for those perishing behind them. But back in , when the Ayrshire branch of this inspiring group formed, few could have imagined the size of their task  years on. Local chair, Marion Boyd, explains: “Our first meeting had only a handful of parents and the whole topic of losing a baby was very taboo. “Thankfully the world has changed a lot since then, and people have become far more open about their loss. “But there’s no doubt that back then, you were not encouraged to speak about it.” For newly grieving mums like Marion, having a place to turn was not in the script of the s. And her experience – along with those of many others – has helped drive the st century changes to hospital support.  Marion, , said: “I had to share a room with another mum who had just given birth. “Watching her push her baby around and hear the cries of a newborn was heartbreaking. “But that was the reality back in those days. “It was almost like you had to dust yourself down and get back to normal as soon as possible. “Then there were the people who wouldn’t know what to say to you...so they’d maybe say nothing at all.” Marion and fellow committee members in the Ayrshire branch of the SANDS group are among Britain’s longest serving. Along with fellow parents, they have raised thousands during the intervening three decades and made friends through their grief. New facilities, latterly built at the Ayrshire maternity unit in Crosshouse, now give newly grieving parents their own space – with SANDS instrumental in their set-up. Treasurer Alison McNeil, , said: “Each of us has our own personal story which brought us together, and obviously they are very sad. “But through the years a special bond has grown between so many of the parents here. “Some of us have become friends for le and we’re just glad we can be here to offer support to others now. “But one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many and it’s a sad reality that our group continues to grow like it does.” From the handful that began the journey in , so many more have passed through the hands of Ayrshire SANDS since then. And on Sunday, hundreds will attend the group’s annual bauble service at Prestwick’s St Nicholas Church. And such is the growing need for the team, they even have their own social media officer. Mum Sarah Speirs, , added: “The best thing is that nobody will judge you. “Ultimately, the only person who can truly understand what it’s like to lose a child is another parent who’s experienced the same thing.” And Marion said: “We were very keen from the outset that we had NHS involvement in the group. “We have an office on site at Crosshouse and work closely with midwives. “Perhaps they could have been wary of us at first, thinking that some parents would want to criticise them. “But they quickly realised that we are all here for the same thing and it’s a relationship that has worked very well. “Ideally the need for our group wouldn’t be there at all, but we’re just glad it can do some good.” •Parents wishing to attend Sunday’s service can bring their own bauble to hang on the Christmas tree.

Whilst providing a first-class service to her clients and the long hours spent in the office, Margo manages to achieve the perfect work-le balance for her family. This is one of the many reasons that she is one of just three finalists for Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland . The ceremony is this Thursdayat the Hilton in Glasgow. Growing up on the family farm in Maybole, Margo has been involved in agriculture since a young age and knew that her career path would lead her into the agricultural industry. Starting her legal career in the city, Margo worked at MacLay, Murray and Spens in Glasgow before moving closer to home at Howat’s Associates in Mauchline, to spend more time with her husband and two sons. Margo then moved to become a Partner at Lockharts in Ayr, and now heads up their Agricultural and Estates Team. Margo was nominated by one of her long-standing clients and will be attending the Awards. Her firm Lockharts are presently rebranding their office and operation at Beresford Terrace.

It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr.

Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas. Poppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them. The Mauchline Primary pupil created an informative poster to share with others about the commitment involved in keeping the four footed pals as pets. Proud mum Elaine, , posted Poppy’s efforts online and her message has gone viral- reaching Germany, Calornia and Australia. The P youngster advised others that rabbits need a big spaced cage, hay, fresh water and lots of TLC. Poppy shares her creatively named bunnies with sister Holly, , and the pair enjoy feeding them snacks of cabbage. Copper, Iggy, Skyler and Jasper are just a handful of the furry friends who make up the Wyllie’s colony.  Poppy decided to make her educational poster after she heard a horror story about a poor rescue bunny. She said: “It lived in a drawer for four years and that’s not fair.” Mum-of-two Elaine said: “I had read a story about a rescue rabbit and told the girls. “And Poppy saidshe could look after her rabbits then an adult shouldn’t be treating their rabbit that way. “She made a poster to raise awareness coming up to Christmas as she wants people to know how much care they need- so they are sure they are a suitable pet for their family. “She wants people to share so all bunnies have a good le and not just a good Christmas.” MBM Vets Mauchline have now shared Poppy’s poster online, urging others to spread the news of what rabbits “need to be healthy and happy”. The animal-daft family own a small zoo with  guinea pigs, two dogs, three budgies, one gecko and five horses making up their collection.

both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick High School and Selkirk High School were given C ratings, while Peebles High School was deemed to have a B, or good, rating."},{"url":null,"title":"devastated-family-pay-tribute-to-charity-that-helped-them-remember-their-beautiful-baby","story":"A FAMILY from Blyth Bridge

turmoil in the sector.The Press Association reported earlier on Friday thatthe company had enlisted KPMG to assess all options for the firm, including an administration.KPMG was initially brought in to oversee an accelerated sale or merger with another provider, but the collapse of rival Extra Energy this week and well-documented pressures in the industry caused alarm among would-be investors.A Spark spokesman said that the company is still working to merge the parent firm and its workforce with a larger provider.ldquoIf successful, it would mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier ndash operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham offices, supplying our customers under the new parent companyrsquos licence, he said.Sparkrsquos failure means it is the seventh small energy supplier to go bust this year, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers in limbo.Spark has nearly , customers in the UK and employs  people at its head office in Selkirk.The failure comes days after Spark missed a deadline to make a pound. million renewable energy payment and barely  hours after rival Extra Energy went bust.The energy market has been hit by stinging regulation, including a Government-enforced price cap on standard iable tarfs amid anger over rising bills.Spark is backed by its chief executive, Chris Gauld, and finance chief Hamish

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

What is fair about that  Mr Leonard asked.Last week headteachers in SNP-run Falkirk issued letters to parents warning about unprecedented funding cuts.He quoted one parent who got a letter, Catherine Sneddon of Borsquoness, whose -year-old son Louis has a learning disability and epilepsy.ldquolsquoYear in year out we brace ourselves for cuts to his support network ... take that away from him and other children who need the ASN [additional support needs] packages ... and our children decline in physical and mental health alongside their medical issues.rsquoldquoIs the First Minister seriously saying to the Sneddon family that that is fair Ms Sturgeon said the leader of Falkirk Council had apologised for the ldquomisleading impression given by the letters, and said education spending had gone up in  .She reminded Mr Leonard that  years ago, Falkirk had taken up a Labour PFI deal for new schools with a capital value of poundm that had ended up costing poundm.She said: ldquoI think Labour should be apologising for that."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-and-jeremy-corbyn-agree-then-disagree-on-brexit-tv-debate-while-nicola-sturgeon-is-frozen-out","story":"After No  stonewalled questions about whether the Prime Minister would or would not face the Labour leader in a televised debate about the UK-EU orce plan, she finally announced: yes, she would.Then on Thursday, it was revealed Mrs May had agreed to take part in a BBC  prime-time debate on the evening of Sunday December , just two days before the crunch ldquomeaningful vote in the Commons.But, as with every other aspect of Brexit, there was a snag.Mr Corbyn prefers ITVrsquos offer as, airing it at pm on the Sunday evening, would avoid an unpopular clash with the final of Irsquom A CelebrityhellipGet Me Out of Here!The Labour leader quipped in an interview with the channelrsquos This Morning: ldquoMaybe I want to watch it myself as well.Yet, a head-to-head on ITV at pm on December  would clash with Sir David Attenboroughrsquos popular Dynasties and any earlier the Brexit showdown would be up against either Dr Who or Strictly Come Dancing.The Corporation said it was ldquodelighted at the PMrsquos participation in its programme.A spokesman explained: \"We have been discussing debate formats with both parties and will announce further details soon.\"He added the BBC hoped \"to hear soon from the Labour Party\" on whether Mr Corbyn would sign up too.But on This Morning, the Labour leader noted: \"The ITV offer seemed a sensible one. It reaches a wider audience and the timing looked good to me because its not inconveniencing people who want to watch other things later in the evening.\"One should always have respect for the viewers and also we want to get the widest possible audience,\" he declared.No  is believed to prefer the BBC programme as it would be the most \"rounded\" and focused on the PMs deal and not the wider political situation.Initially, the Corporation suggested a debate on Thursday December  but Mr Corbynrsquos office said it preferred the Sunday night, which Downing St was happy to agree to.However, one person who is not happy is Nicola Sturgeon, who has been frozen out of the televised event.The First Minister tweeted her displeasure, saying: ldquoIf this or any Brexit TV debate goes ahead without all options - including that of remaining in the EU - being included and given a voice, it will be an absolute travesty of democracy.\"Her SNP colleague Ian Blackford, the partyrsquos leader at Westminster, said a May-Corbyn debate would be a ldquopretty narrow\" one and that it was ldquodisrespectful not to have the third party involved.Noting how the Conservatives and Labour both supported Brexit in the  election, the Highland MP insisted: ldquoWe have a distinctive voice and it should be heard.Equally incensed is Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, who said: ldquoMay is running scared of the real opposition. A debate shouldnrsquot take place between two cosy Brexiters.ldquoThe public demand the full facts and figures on the cost of Brexit. They also deserve to hear all the options. A Peoples Vote, including the option to remain, is the only real alternative. I will make that case anytime, anywhere, he declared.The Lib Dems are now consulting lawyers to seetheir exclusion breaches the Ofcom code.In a letter to Lord Hall, the Corporationrsquos Director General, Sal Brinton, the partyrsquos President, wrote: ldquoThe Ofcom Broadcasting Code emphasises the need for lsquodue impartialityrsquo and lsquoan appropriately wide range of signicant views must be included and given due weightrsquo in such proposed programmes.ldquoThis is something that could not be achieved in a head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May without a Liberal Democrat representative, she added."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-says-peoples-vote-would-unpick-brexit-deal-agreed-with-brussels","story":"Appearing before senior MPs, the Prime Minister refused to be drawn on what would happenthe Commons voted down her Brexit Plan in the crunch vote on December .However, she stressed that a Peoples Vote was not, in any case, an option as it could not be held before March   when Britain left the EU.Mrs May told the Commons Liaison Committee that seeking an extension to the Article  withdrawal process - to enable a referendum to be held - would mean the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement would fall and the two sides would have to go back to the negotiating table.\"Any second referendum that would be held,that were the case, would not be able to be held by March  next year. You would have to extend Article . To extend Article , you are then in the business of renegotiating the deal.\"What is clear is that any extension to Article  - anything like that - reopens the negotiations, reopens the deal. At that point, frankly, the deal can go in any direction.She added: \"We would simply find ourselves in a period of more uncertainty, more ision in this country.\"However, leading Tory Remainer Justine Greening, a former Cabinet colleague, said she had worked out that a new Brexit referendum could be organised and held in  weeks.ldquoWe could actually, after this vote on December , hold a referendum, potentially, on May  next year. We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article , Ive suggested, by four months to July ,\" said the London MP.Earlier this week, John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, signalled a signicant sht in Labour policy by suggesting a second EU referendum would be \"inevitable\" unless the PM, on the back of her Brexit Plan being rejected, called a general election.Mrs May brushed aside MPsrsquo questions about what would happenher Brexit deal were rejected the week after next, stressing that what was important was to focus on the nature of the vote on the UK-EU agreed deal.\"This is an important point in our history. It is a vote on which we will be deciding whether we deliver on the decision of the British people, she declared.Last night, a cross-party group of Remain-backing MPs - including Labourrsquos Hilary Benn and the Toriesrsquo Dominic Grieve, tabled an amendment to the meaningful vote aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit.Mr Benn tweeted: \"It opposes the deal, rejects a no-deal Brexit and would enable the House to express its view about what should happen nextthe PMs deal is defeatedhellipby allowing amendments to be tabled to the motion that the Government would have to put before the Commons under the EU Withdrawal Act .\"In other developments:*Labours Keir Starmer accused Mrs May of \"showing contempt\" for Parliament after she refused to publish the full legal advice on her Brexit Plan. The Shadow Brexit Secretary said the Governmentrsquos offer to send Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, to answer questions in the Commons was not acceptable. The PM has ruled out releasing the legal advice, insisting it was \"privileged\".*Official statistics sparked claims of a ldquoBrexodus after they showed net EU migration in the year to June was ,, its lowest level since . Overall net migration was slightly up due to a sharp rise in people coming to the UK from outwith Europe.*Ben Wallace, the UK Security Minister, warned a no-deal scenario would have a ldquoreal impact on the Governmentrsquos ability to protect the public.*Jo Johnson, the former minister and brother of Brexiteer Boris, warned: ldquoThis half-baked worst of all words Brexit could trigger electoral defeat on the scale of  or worse this lsquoTory Brexitrsquo label will be an albatross around our necks for years to come."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-time-to-defeat-the-deal-and-hand-the-next-move-to-the-government","story":"You may think this a poor argument, but economics, for all its value in analysing generalities, is not much better than astrology at predicting specics. Economists study rational behaviour, but itrsquos not the fact that some people act irrationally which makes it impossible to make accurate economic predictions itrsquos built into the model. If everyone acted completely rationally, market behaviour would actually become more unpredictable, because only unforeseeable events would move markets.There are plenty of reasons to think that the general assumptions of forecasters are right ndash that Brexit will be disruptive and, at least in the short term, damaging to the UK economy. But there are plenty of reasons not to think that, too. Not least of them the fact that every single prediction made about what would happen in the immediate aftermath of the referendum voteturned out to be wrong.There has been growthevery quarter, rather than the promised recession, inward investment went up, employment and the FTSE both reached all-time highs, and so on.The response from forecasters has been to say: OK, we got all that wrong. But the economy would have done even better, had it not been for the referendum vote. Well, maybe. After all, we havenrsquot had the easy negotiations predicted by the pro-Brexit camp, either.They may, with reason, claim that not one of the several workable prescriptions for a clean exit was followed, but they were also the people who assured us that our EU membership was an establishment stitch-up, so should perhaps have anticipated some such trouble. Particularly the Tories, who then selected as their leader a Remain supporter with no interest in trade, markets or liberalism, but with a swivel-eyed obsession with immigration.Herersquos another illustration of the value of prediction. Not long ago, Gavin Barwell, Theresa Mayrsquos Aquarian Chief of Staff, told Tory MPs that any attempt to drum up Labour votes to get the Prime Ministerrsquos withdrawal agreement through Parliament risked splitting the party and bringing down the Government and, according to one Brexiter, ldquosolemnly promised that he never would. A few days ago, Mr Barwell addressed Labour MPs begging them to back the deal.Meanwhile, Brexit-supporting Tories claim that  Conservative MPs plan to vote against the deal. You may be cagey about this prediction, too: remember that a couple of weeks ago they were sure that  of their number had sent in letters of no confidence in Mrs May as leader.We are, in short, in a situation where no one has any confidence in what will happen on December , when MPs vote on Mrs Mayrsquos deal, but where we are also expected to take it as Holy Writ that a no-deal Brexit will make the economy smaller by exactly . per cent over  years.The same analysis suggests voting for the deal will make the economy smaller by . per cent over the same period, which explains why the only person still prepared to pretend it is a good deal is Mrs May. She is now selling it to Remainers as more or less the same as staying in the EU, or anyway the next best thing, while telling Brexiters thatthey donrsquot vote for it, we wonrsquot get to leave at all, or thatwe do, Armageddon will follow. She is, after all, a Libran.But since neither she nor anyone  has any idea whatrsquos going to happen in under a fortnightrsquos time, I find her sureties about the longer term unpersuasive. Even the anti-Brexit economist Paul Krugman ndash like Mr Carney, a Piscean ndash thinks the no-deal catastrophe predictions are wildly over-stated.But the options presented by Remainers are unequally uncertain. We donrsquot know yet whether just revoking Article  and cancelling the whole thing is possible at all. We can make a guess thatit is, it wouldnrsquot end up with the UK in an improved position, or even the status quo ante. The EU would, bluntly, know it could walk all over us, which would no doubt inform its attitude towards everything from the rebate to Schengen and membership of the Euro.The other great hope ndash the ldquoRight Kind of Peoplersquos Vote ndash is no foregone conclusion, either. It canrsquot be done without reversing the biggest popular vote ever and a parliamentary majority mandated by the manestos of both the major parties it probably canrsquot be done in time at all.Evennone of those things were true, what makes the Remainers certain the outcome would be dferent  Many polls suggest they would now win the polls before the last referendum claimed the same thing, and, funnily enough, by the same sorts of margins.We have at least been able to assess the proposed deal, but everyone who has done so has concluded that itrsquos terrible. Which leaves one last great unknowable: what can be doneit is defeated Naturally, it is no more possible to know that than any of the other things. Perhaps the Government would fall, or perhaps wersquod have a change of Tory leader perhaps someone would pull another previously mooted solution, such as Efta membership or a Switzerland or Canada-style deal with a lot of plus signs after it, out of the bag, or perhaps wersquod crash out with no deal at all.There is one advantage in those possible scenarios, though, which doesnrsquot apply to Mrs Mayrsquos deal, another vote, or giving the whole thing up as a bad idea. It would both respect the referendum result and place the choices about what to do next in the hands of the UK Government.You may doubt whether, on their track record, this is a recipe for success, but it would at least be an assumption of responsibility. I believe the astrologer Mystic Meg has invested much of her considerable earnings in a company that owns a string of racehorses.

Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, joins Marlene Shiels, chief executive Capital Credit Union, and Jessica Graham, member of Capital Credit Union, to promote the new campaign.\"  Our credit unions put people before profitsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rabbits in Bass Cemetery are to be gassed in an attempt to control the population.\"  Fury over gassing of rabbits at Bass viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We have used bikes in the past and thought this peddle-powered car would be a slightly dferent iant.\"Rev Bissett, an ordained minister who does supply for Fodderty and Strathpeffer Church of Scotland and who lives at First Field Avenue, North Kessock with we Susan, minister for Killearnan and Knockbain churches, said it was good to watch it leaving for a new home.\"Im glad that it is going to be put to good use now,\" he said. \"I couldnt have scrapped it.

Dark skies have a le of their own. To gaze up at a clear night sky free of light pollution continues to leave me spellbound, unsuccessfully grasping for words to describe the unfathomable wonder of it all.“It is an absolute delight to celebrate the Dark Skies of Tomintoul and Glenlivet.” Prof Brown added: “Town-dwelling visitors who visit here will find their blood race when they find the sky to be black and flooded with thousands of brilliant stars rather than yellow grey and dotted with a few bright smudges.“Amateur astronomers will love what wonders the site offers through their telescopes and keen astro-photographers will be able to use extremely long exposure times to get fabulous images of faint cosmic objects. “On top of all this are the general wellbeing benefits associated with dark skies.“Suppression of unnecessary light improves human sleep patterns, saves money and can actually increase security.“It also retains the habitats of erse nocturnal wildle such as moths, birds, bats and even some mammals.”The four-year project is part of the Tomintoul and Glenlivet Landscape Partnership of land owners, community groups, local businesses and schools. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4836834.1543507447!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit may s 3 hours in scotland show how hard she s trying to sell deal","story":"Theresa May#s stage-managed trip to Bridge of Weir was typical of a Prime Minister who makes meaningless gestures but ignores Scotland#s interests entirely, writes Tom Arthur MSP.The Prime Minister spent a grand total of three hours in Scotland yesterday.She’s not even trying to sell her Brexit deal hard. That’s because she knows it’s such a hard sell. In fact, nobody is under any illusion that Theresa May will get her Brexit deal through the Commons on  December. It is a bad deal and – for very good reasons – it lacks support in parliament.Her flying visit was stage-managed to the nth degree – a closed factory visit, no risk of encountering the general public and a handpicked media presence, with several journalists barred from the event for fear of tough questions being asked. The Bridge of Weir locals didn’t even know she was in town.So why bother Well, it is so typical of this Prime Minister to make meaningless gestures to Scotland while ignoring our interests entirely. In fact, ignoring Scotland has become the hallmark of her approach to this country over the past two years.Scotland, of course, voted overwhelmingly to Remain within the EU. We voted to maintain close ties with our European neighbours, the ability to trade freely, the freedom to live and work across the continent and to attract the talent we need to work in our communities, our universities and our health service.There has been no attempt whatsoever to respect that outcome. We have been ignored at every turn.But the SNP has been willing to compromise. We have been clear that we could accept remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union as the least worst option to protect Scotland’s interests – jobs, living standards and our economy.Again, this perfectly sensible compromise has been ignored at every turn.The Tories are now offering a completely  choice. Either we take the Prime Minister’s Bad Deal, which will make Scotland poorer, slice £ billion off GDP equalling £, per head of population, or we crash out of the EU with No Deal, which will similarly plunge the entire UK into chaos.: FMQs: Tories ‘exploiting’ independence to avoid Brexit questionsWhen neither of these options commands the support of parliament, when neither will leave the country better off, when both will damage the economy, impact jobs and harm our NHS, then surely it is high time to think again That is why the SNP will support any opportunity arising which allows us to respect the choice that Scotland made in  and protects our people from the damage of Brexit. We will support whatever option can garner enough support to defeat this Tory Government – whether that is a renewed opportunity to Remain in the EU through a second referendum or a Norway-style deal which keeps us in the Single Market.While the SNP is showing leadership amid the Brexit chaos, no wonder the Prime Minister is running feart and so keen to dodge questions. She’s the one responsible. Her party created the mess. It’s their mess to clean up.: Joyce McMillan: SNP faces huge decisions over Brexit and Scottish independenceTo each and every question over the turmoil she’s overseeing, and the grave consequences for Scotland, she pivots to the matter of Scottish independence.It is a puzzling tactic.In , Scotland was told that the only way to protect our future in Europe was to vote no to independence. That has now been exposed for the lie it always was.The only way Scotland can be sure that we are never again subjected to the democratic travesty that is Brexit is to become an independent country.We relish making that argument and gently suggest to the Prime Minister it ain’t her strong suit.The more day-tripping Tory politicians ignore Scotland’s interests, ignore our right to make decisions for ourselves and fail to respect those decisions we make, the more support for the SNP and independence will continue to grow.Tom Arthur is SNP MSP for Renfrewshire South and a member of the Scottish Parliament’s Constitution Committee©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4836902.1543513810!/image/image.jpg","title":"by st andrew unionists must stop nationalists hijacking saltire pamela nash","story":"Scotland#s culture, heritage and flag do not belong to any political movement but to everyone in the country, writes Pamela Nash of Scotland in Union.St Andrew’s Day has arrived, and it should be a time to reflect on what it means to be Scottish, and to celebrate our history, our culture and our achievements. This belongs to all who live in or share an affinity for Scotland. What better opportunity to forty our Scottish patriotism than on our national day Unfortunately, many feel that our shared heritage has been hijacked by the nationalist movement, and it has put them off celebrating our Scottishness. This is nothing short of tragic. We should be able to be visibly proud of our country regardless of whether we see the best way forward for Scotland as remaining part of the UK or as a separate country.Over recent years, the SNP and its fellow nationalists have tried to appropriate everything that is Scottish, using biased versions of our history, our culture and our symbols to their own ends. This is most prominent in their use of our Saltire. This is why Scotland in Union has been running the #EveryonesFlag campaign, as a reminder that no political party or movement has a monopoly on our culture and heritage. Those of us who made known our wish to remain in the UK were no strangers to being accused of “talking Scotland down” during the referendum campaign, and since. This doubting of someone’s loyalty to their country is abominable.It is a desperate tactic to use emotional blackmail as a tool to persuade proud Scots to overcome their valid scepticism of separatism and make the referendum a choice between Scotland and the UK.For many of us, our Scottish and British identities sit perfectly comfortably with each other and we recognise that being in the UK is best for Scotland. That’s why it’s important for us to assert our Scottish identity whenever it feels appropriate and not cede this to the narrow nationalists who can see it as their own preserve.: Brexit: ‘May’s  hours in Scotland show how hard she’s trying to sell deal’A few years ago, when I was MP for Airdrie and Shotts, an SNP candidate rented a shop a couple of doors up from my constituency office to use as an election campaign room. Every day, there was a loudspeaker outside playing Scottish songs on a loop. People staffing the campaign room were quite open to me and my team that they were doing it to try and wind us up. And they were right, it did wind me up.But not for the reason they intended. For them, this music belonged to nationalists, we were not true Scots so would be irritated by this music. That is what wound me up, not the tunes. How dare they think that The enduring images of the years of campaigning in the lead-up to the  referendum are those Yes and No badges, posters, and stickers. And the one that really stands out for me, for all the wrong reasons, is the Saltire with ‘Yes’ emblazoned across it.This hijacking of our most prominent Scottish image jolted me. The message was clear: we represent Scotland,you are a real Scot, you should be voting Yes.In response, I displayed a giant Saltire in my living room window. Let’s be clear, no political campaign has a monopoly on our culture and heritage, including our flag. If this issue was consigned to , it could be left to lie. But here we are, more than four years on, and it continues.: Scottish independence: If UK didn’t exist, we’d invent it – Pamela NashIn October, the pro-independence campaign launched a new fundraising drive under the banner of the Scottish Independence Convention. As part of this initiative, it is running an online survey to assess the views of its supporters. In it, it asks respondents how much they agree or disagree with the following statement: “People recognise that the Saltire is aligned with the independence movement.” Hardly subtle, is it  It’s clear that the Scottish Independence Convention is seeking a positive response to this so that it can continue the campaign to make Scotland’s national flag a political symbol.Instead, we need stop creating isions, celebrate together and remember that we have more in common than ides us.Most Scottish children are forever scarred with their memories of St Andrew’s Day, when normal PE activities were suspended in favour of ceilidh-dancing lessons and they had to endure the annual primary school ritual of pulling jumper sleeves down over their hands, so they did not have to actually touch a member of the opposite sex whilst dancing. That all changes at high school, of course. These are memories that bind us. There is so much more we have in common.All Scots know the terror that is the midge, that sausages are square, that our money is legal tenderand our water just tastes better. We enjoy telling visitors that Scots are the world’s best inventors, about that time we think we saw Nessie and explaining how to catch a haggis. And approaching Christmas, as a kid it was the Tunnock’s van that indicated that ‘holidays are coming’, and now it’s the Irn Bru ad we are all waiting to see.Our heritage and our common memories are nothing to do with politics, they are nothing to do with whether you want Scotland to remain in the UK oryou want it to be a separate country. They are what we all have in common.St Andrew’s Day, our flag, everything that is Scottish, is for everyone in Scotland regardless of political beliefs.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Mr Paisley thanked voters for their unwavering support and told the : “I am honoured and humbled by the overwhelming support I have received from the people of North Antrim.”Of his suspension, he said: “I have taken what I still consider to be a severe punishment on the chin and I also think many a smaller man would have crumbled.Now that the North Antrim MP is back on his green bench he is keen to get on with work and put his suspension firmly in the past.Speaking exclusively to thelast week, he said: “Back to Westminister this week couldn’t have been timed better given the activities and the intrigue. “The parliamentary week commenced with business on Monday on the Finance bill.“The party abstained on the vote disproving again the claim by my political opponents that my suspension would impact on crucial votes. “Tuesday I was back into the thick of it with a meeting with the foreign office minister Alistair Burt MP to discuss Libya and compensation for victims of Libyan sponsored terrorism. This was an important meeting for victims and an ongoing project. “Later I met the Chairman of the DCMS select committee for a presentation about the impact of the advertising association and its role post Brexit. “Wednesday is always the busiest day in Parliament and this week was no exception.“It started with an am meeting with the aerospace industry.In light of  redundancies announced this week it proved to be very critical briefing. “Then I was back to the NI select committee to question the Secretary of State this is the only time the minister is put through her paces.“Obviously we have huge disagreements with the government on the withdrawal agreement. But at least it’s a civilised debate.“Many will remember the acusationary terms under which other political agreements were debated and opponents accused of being anti peace. At least the government, for all its folly, appears resigned to the obvious opposition.“I remain determined to oppose this government plan. We can get much better terms upon which to fulfil the wishes of the people to leave the EU. “That afternoon was my first opportunity to participate in a full Debate in the house on the important matter of the fishing Bill.“Later that evening I had a dinner and meeting with the Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn CBE who leads on intelligence and I had a briefing about defence and security issues that I cannot elaborate on.“On Thursday morning I got word the PM was planning a statement. This coincided with much publicity given to a meeting with manufacturers and business leaders with the PM.“I took the opportunity to meet with some of these business leaders before attending the PM statement where I asked her a question on the political agreement. “Earlier I attended a debate about Bombardier redundancies and questioned the minister about the supply chain. “I got back home late on Thursday night and on Friday met with the chancellor and business leaders about the economy.“Yes it’s good to be back in Parliament doing the job I was elected by the people to do.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1271172.jpg--.jpg?1543325019000\n","title":"phenomenal response from public helps locate debbie","story":"PEOPLE in Ballymena came out in their droves recently to help locate a vulnerable dog who had been rescued from a puppy farm.  Debbie, a Cavachon, was rescued from a puppy farm in the south of Ireland and was bound for Ballymena to her foster home.However when the car she was travelling in stopped she got spooked and escaped.Volunteer for Cavaliers in Need, Lynn Kyle, said Debbie ran from Ballee to the Seven Towers roundabout before disappearing into the surrounding fields.This all happened on Friday eveningso we immediately put a call out on Facebook for people to keep an eye out for her, Lynn explained.The response was absolutely phenomenal. People went out to look for Debbie who had no knowledge of her.Debbie was missing all day Saturday and Sunday and as time wore on Lynn said she feared the worst.I knew because of my experience with dogs from puppy farms that they wont eat and will be terried of humans because they have been treated so badly in the past.We kept looking for her across the fields but there was no sign of her.On Sunday evening one of our volunteers came and put two animal traps down in the location where she was last seen.These traps dont hurt the dog they simply have a door which shuts behind them once they step inside.Thankfully Debbie came back to the area and was found in the trap in the early hours of Monday morning .Lynn told thethat she and other members of the Cavaliers in Need charity were so overwhelmed with the response from people in Ballymena.It was so heartwarming. “People didnt know anything about this dog but they gave up their weekend to go looking for her.The charity Lynn volunteers for are appealing for people to sign up and help in any way they can.If you have a passion for animals, a safe home and secure back garden then you could become a foster home.All the dogs we rescue have been treated in the most horrendous way. We rescue them and bring them to warm, caring, loving homes.We just want to thank everyone in Ballymena who helped to try and locate Debbie. We are very grateful.Debbie is now in her foster home and is recovering well.If you would like to volunteer with Cavaliers in Need you can contact them their Facebook page.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newly published childrens book aims to teach important message for a worthy cause","story":"A new children’s book, designed to introduce small children to the world’s big issues and aid vital charity work, is the latest work of West Belfast woman Arlene Gormley.Co-founder of the Feeding Dreams Cambodia charity, Arlene has penned, designed and illustrated ‘ Not A Fairytale’ describing how even from a young age we can work to make the planet better for now and future generations.Feeding Dreams Cambodia was founded in  and offers free education and nutrition for  children in Cambodia’s tourist capital of Siem Reap. The charity receives no government funding and relies solely on donations, most of which comes from support and fundraising drives in Belfast. Arlene explained how the book is based on the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goalsthat recognise ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education.“Our approach at Feeding Dreams is holistic,” explained Arlene. “ Our programmes in education, medical care, community support, vocational training, they are all interlinked, so when the UN announced the  Goals, it helped give us the framework and language for our strategy. Since each of our programmes can be tied to one of the  SDGs and the Cambodian government ratied the SDGs, it gave us legitimacy and credibility.”“I decided to create a handmade book introducing the SDGs to young children through colourful pictures with simplistic explanations. The book was originally intended as a keepsake for my four-year-old niece Zara but the message has struck a chord with parents and teachers. I’m holding a book launch on Saturday in the city centre’s Learning Space store and all sales from the book will go towards the work of the charity. “During the Christmas period people are very generous with their donations but it’s when all the rush calms down and we go into what we call our ‘leaner’ months of January, February that we need that extra push make sure all the children receive a proper, balanced meal.”Arlene became a mother herself in August and is now more determined than ever to ensure her daughter Julia has a keen understanding of the world around her.“Children are born into an uncertain and unequal world and parents worry about the kind of environment their children grow up in. It’s important to me that my daughter understands from a early age about important issues that will affect her future, like climate change, access to health and education, and the importance of equality.” The Queen’s University graduate spoke of how the visually striking picture book was “something a little dferent” for the bedtime hour. “It’s a great way to sit with a child and read each chapter, look at the illustrations, it’s a great tool to show what is going on in the world and at the same time contribute to the work of Feeding Dreams.”Arlene will be signing copies of her book at Fountain Centre’s Learning Space store on Saturday, December  from am until noon. Not A Fairytale is priced at £.

It came after the Chief Constable raised concerns there was no mechanism to make temporary appointments to his senior command team permanent and he risked losing valuable staff to other forces amidst the continuing political deadlock. The Policing Board is the main oversight body for the PSNI and is made up of members including  political representatives.On Thursday, Karen Bradley confirmed the political appointments of Keith Buchanan, Joanne Bunting, Gary Middleton, Mervyn Storey from the DUP. Gerry Kelly, Linda Dillon, Philip McGuigan for Sinn Fein. John Blair for Alliance, Dolores Kelly for the SDLP and Alan Chambers for the UUP. Mrs Bradley said she would be engaging with local parties urgently in order to work on the restoration of power sharing. \"I am pleased to make these appointments to the Northern Ireland Policing Board to ensure that this important body can get back to work,\" she said.\"The Policing Board has a unique role in that it has primacy for policing accountability, but it also has an important advocacy role to play on issues that contribute to police service effectiveness, efficiency, partnership working and overall good policing. I am confident these new appointments will enhance the Board’s ability to fulfil this role.\"She added: \"In October , I introduced the Northern IrelandAct . The legislation enabled me to make key public appointments to a number of bodies including the Northern Ireland Policing Board.\"Whilst I am pleased to announce these appointment and we will continue to make the necessary interventions to ensure good governance and the delivery of public services, this can never be a substitute for local decision making. It would be much better for devolved ministers to be in place to make these decisions - including on key public appointments.!That is why I will be engaging the parties urgently, along with the Tanaiste in line with the well-established three stranded approach, to work to find a solution that gets the Executive restored and delivering for the people of NI.\""},{"url":null,"title":"were not the enemy northern ireland chamber of commerce chief says agreement critics should offer new plan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher            With the Executive absent for nearly two years, Ms Grahamasked whether politicians here had \"lost the plot\".The chamber has said it supports the draft Withdrawal Agreement reached by Prime Minister Theresa May with the remaining  EU states.It includes a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. DUPs Foster advocates Norway plus deal to satisfy DUPs red line on Brexit The stance of the NI Chamber, shared by the other main business groups, has placed it in opposition to the DUP, which is against the agreement and has urged the UK Government to seek further negotiations with the EU.While Ms Grahams speech did not refer explicitly to the DUP last night, she said the chambers pro-agreement stance had caused it some dficulties with \"critics\".\"Weve received a lot of stick in some quarters for saying this but let me say to our critics - were not your opposition,\" she said.\"Were not the enemy. \"We want the outcome thats best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland - and we will do everything we can to ensure that we get it.\" Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal Last night, Ms Graham said the growth of innovation in the economy was being held back by the absence of a Stormont Executive and \"endless Brexit bickering\".She said: \"Last week, the Belfastprovided a list of all the things that are being held up by the lack of an Executive - a pile-up of more than  decisions affecting all aspects of Northern Ireland le - all needing the signature of a minister.\"Ms Graham added: \"After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland and it is definitely much better than a no-deal scenario. \"We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them.\"For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.\" She said that Northern Ireland needed arrangements to ensure continued access to workers from overseas.\"Our companies are committed to developing homegrown talent but that alone is not enough to fill the skills gap,\" Ms Graham stressed.She said the province needed a tailored approach, rejecting a £, minimum salary threshold for migrant workers after Brexit, which was contained in a report by the migrant advisory committee.Last nights event also heard from TV writer Jed Mercurio, who has created TV shows Line of Duty, which is filmed in Belfast.Ms Graham referred to an article by Belfast-born producer Terry George, who made Hotel Rwanda.In the article, the filmmaker had discussed the willingness of then First Minister Peter Robinson and his Deputy Martin McGuinness to visit film producers in Los Angeles to encourage them to work in Northern Ireland.Their work led to the arrival of producers HBO, which filmed eight seasons of fantasy series Game of Thrones - delivering a major boost to the film industry, tourism and economy.She said: \"Game of Thrones and HBO and the others didnt come here by accident.\"There was a lot of support from the previous generation of Northern Irelands political leadership. They stepped out of their comfort zones too.\"The Belfast filmmaker and Oscar-winner Terry George wrote an article earlier this year recalling the days when Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson struggled through traffic in Los Angeles to visit all the major studios, lobbying for more productions to come to Northern Ireland.\"In his article, Terry asked, Whos going to do that now \"Its a good question. Can you imagine our current leaders at this juncture sharing a car under any circumstances \"Who will nurture the creative connections now  Well, Im afraid I have no answer.\"She said thatpolitical le in Northern Ireland was a dramatic production, it was \"stuck in the second act\".\"The tensions still rising, the stakes are even higher but theres no progress towards act three.\"No resolution. It makes me wonder - do our politicians no longer care  Or have they simply lost the plot \"At the start of this year, Ms Graham, who is a former head of Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland and a chairman of all-island electricity company ESB, urged politicians to lt Northern Ireland out of the \"quagmire\" of political stalemate.Ms Graham also told the guests last night that she will be succeeded as chamber president by IT company Allstate head, John Healy."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37580704.ece/43a49/AUTOCROP/w620h342/supppic3.jpg","title":"dups foster advocates norway plus deal to satisfy dups red line on brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations.  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"increase in rail fares to be announced","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint.

Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town. This is an extremely serious issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9036866.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It said , pupils of compulsory school age were suspended in  , with the ETI noting that “alarmingly”,  were of primary school age, with  in primary one or two. Repeated infringement of school rules was among the main reasons for suspensions.But UTU deputy general secretary Jacquie White said that schools “will not be scapegoated by the cynical funding shortfall for NI’s most vulnerable children”.She told the News Letter: “The ETI has highlighted these suspension and exclusion statistics yet surely even it must see that their growing trajectory inversely reflects the declining funding of special schools and other supports for children with additional needs.“For whatever reason – societal and economic – we are seeing an ever increasing number of children with increasingly complex behavioural and learning needs coming into the mainstream.”Principals are being forced to cut back on specialist classroom assistants and formal psychological assessments but are seeing “a growing number of violent incidents in the classroom” due to particular needs not being met. She added: “These are among our most vulnerable children. They deserve the best.”Autism NI CEO Kerry Boyd confirmed that exclusions and suspensions for autistic children are on the rise. “In the UK, a child with autism is three times more likely to be excluded from the school environment which is an unacceptable and distressing statistic for the autism community,” she said. Even children who are formally recognised as autistic are often not get getting the correct support, she added. Children’s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma did not underestimate the challenge of cutbacks. “If alternatives to suspension are not available to schools due to such a lack – including specialist and support staff – then this must be addressed as a matter of urgency,” she said.\"  \"  Kids as young as  are being suspended from Northern Ireland schools Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

On average,  months after rollout, foodbanks see a % increase in demand, compared to % in areas with Universal Credit for  months or less.“All the evidence available suggests that the introduction of Universal Credit in new communities is swtly followed by hardship for struggling families. The introduction of welfare cuts has led to foodbanks being overrun and all politicians locally need to recognise the impact of welfare cuts it has on the people they represent. “The new welfare system is increasingly driving referrals to food banks due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.“The generosity of people who donate to the foodbanks and the volunteers who manage and distribute the food are an inspiration.“Unfortunately, the winter months are more dficult were foodbanks typically receive more referrals for emergency support and we need to redouble our efforts. “To express our gratitude, the SDLP will be doing our bit this Christmas to assist local foodbanks and doing all we can to help families under pressure.”Council staff visit aerosol paint sellers after spike in graffiti Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.
