Each day ministers sent out to steady the ship in press conferences and broadcast studios tip it a bit closer to capsizing. Asking Michael Gove to soothe the teachers on Sunday with his, “Teachers will be safe in schools” line was about as reassuring to those he called “the blob” as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’s Child Catcher summoning children from their cellars. When there are differences of opinion between scientists on what counts as safe, only honesty about what is in doubt earns political trust. But daily, they blow their credibility away.Paralysis during their leader’s brush with death has given way since his return to alarm at their helmsman’s zigzag steering. His 13-minute address to the nation did more to hole the ship than buoy it in public opinion. No efforts were made to ease in his new back-to-work message. Without consulting teachers, care home managers, mayors or leaders of the other nations, of course he faced a backlash. Stay alert? It hasn’t exactly tripped off ministerial tongues since then.Boris Johnson swept to power on brilliant messaging, his spinners turning straw to electoral gold with “Take back control” and “Get Brexit done”, but all that’s gone. He likes to be liked, yet approval ratings are tumbling: Opinium polls showed a +42 net approval rating for his handling of the virus in March that has fallen to -3. YouGov’s +51 net approval rating on 27 March has plunged to -2. Keir Starmer’s personal rating overtook Johnson’s last week. The government was sent into a flat spin by Starmer’s trouncing of Johnson at prime minister’s questions over the appalling care home death rates.Fresh from a mega-victory and an age from the next election, why should the government panic? Because serial bungles, missteps, policy reversals and a vanishing connection with honesty risk damaging it beyond repair. No one knows all the right numbers yet, but trust shrinks when the government misuses them anyway. After Prof Tim Spector warned that Britain’s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant between 50,000 and 70,000 people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add “loss of sense of smell” to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind.One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a “slippery opponent”. How revealing: there’s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour’s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he’s bereft when his old bluster can’t beguile away deaths.Trust is ebbing away just when it’s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school it’s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. “Only following the science,” ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew.Take Matt Hancock’s dumbfounding claim on Friday: “Right from the start we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes … we’ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.” What sentient voter doesn’t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes – some close to bankruptcy – were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust.No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public’s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures.But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes will be tested by early June – but will that be every week, with prompt results?“Following the science” often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she backed Johnson’s plan not to ban large gatherings, noting: “We’ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don’t want to disrupt people’s lives.” She defended a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.” She called the UK “an international exemplar in preparedness” and told doctors to have a “more adult” conversation about the lack of PPE. She reiterated advice that it was “very unlikely” care homes would be infected.This government of world-class spinners and top-dollar public opinion manipulators are learning nothing: on Friday Hancock’s disingenuous figures on how many tests had been carried out – almost double the number of iniduals actually tested – were instantly tripped up by the BBC’s Reality Check. As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss?Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it’s not fair he’s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive union consultation. When the British Medical Association backed the teachers, doctors came under attack: that certainly won’t end well.Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if “levelling up” is still Johnson’s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones – for example, to Wiltshire more than to Knowsley on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories’ favoured regular enemy, as they force him to raise public transport fares in London.But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel’s refusal to lift the £625-a-year NHS surcharge on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn’t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner – but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis.Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public’s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48950dd59255a0d7429ecb42741d2c6f20f00036/0_170_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7fa7447c8c96a01f0f65c5c681e7674","title":"covid 19 children hospices west midlands","story":"I’m inspired by a West Midlands charity, but our community’s most vulnerable members are being hit the hardestLast December I visited a charity that is very close to my heart: Acorns children’s hospice.I had the privilege of chatting, telling stories and reading some of my poetry to an inspirational group of children and families. . And they performed some of their poetry for me.I have over the past 10 years met many children and young people using the services of this West Midlands charity. We have shared our love for poetry, talked about the importance of caring for all living beings, and our love of cake, music and Aston Villa football club. I am so inspired by the kids, and I also have an enormous amount of respect for the people who work there. I want to hug and kiss them, I want to tell them how much I love them, but I just shake their hands and act normal. Not only do they care for these kids, some of whom are not expected to reach adulthood they also look after their mums, dads, brothers and sisters, even grandparents. The existence of children’s hospices is something many of us feel uncomfortable with – most people tend to associate hospices with older people. I was one of them, until I first visited.Those working and volunteering there do everything they can to make special memories for the children and their families. I have rarely been to a place where love, happiness and joy were so abundant. I have never felt a hint of doom or gloom.I’m not one of those who call these times weird, strange, difficult or unprecedented. They are, but I’m a vegan, animal rightist and environmentalist, so I thought a crisis such as this had to happen at some time. But since the start of this pandemic Acorns’ 600 or so children and young people have been on my mind. I am told most of the families are shielding their children at home, understandably doing everything to avoid them being infected with coronavirus. It was said that the illness is generally mild in children, but there is now evidence that children can be affected in ways the experts are only beginning to understand. This horrifies me. We all know the risks for adults with serious underlying health issues, but what about children and young people? With the emergence of a “Kawasaki”-like Covid-19-linked disease, I can only imagine how difficult it is for these families. They have to protect their precious children when services they rely on are no longer available, and when they are cut off from so many people who’ve been been part of their support network.We’re all beginning to know more about what is happening in adult care homes, but I wonder what is happening to children’s hospices all over the country. At Acorns’ three hospices, members of the public are turning up every few minutes with car-loads of donations. We’re lucky to have such a giving society here in the UK.The staff are also reaching out to families through regular calls, letting them know they are not alone at this scary time.Over the course of this global emergency there have been times when we have seen the virus infect the rich and famous, powerful and influential, and humble world leaders. But as with all emergencies, it’s the most vulnerable members of our community who get hit the hardest.I have just signed a letter addressed to Boris Johnson calling for an independent public inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and ethnic minority communities, because for me this is real. I’ve lost two members of my family, and another couple have come close to the edge.I can’t stop thinking about the kids at Acorns. I can’t stop thinking about the elderly and the infirm, the young and vulnerable, the homeless, the families caring for a seriously ill baby or child.Once this terrible chapter comes to an end, what will the next chapter have in store? I would like to think we will retain the strong sense of compassion and community that has been so in evidence during this crisis, and try to turn our backs on ision, deprivation and inequality. That’s not too much to ask for, is it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41707cff9b7d3764de7068986300a19fd5bd041f/978_1296_2069_1241/master/2069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57c76256d96b99aa354f7472a3dd0fb6","title":"lockdown sceptics coronavirus brexit","story":"The dismissal of coronavirus expertise, the pitting of ‘elites’ against ‘the people’ – it’s Brexit all over again for the high-profile contrariansWithin days of Boris Johnson announcing lockdown restrictions in late March, Toby Young – self-appointed general secretary of the Free Speech Union – had his own take on the government’s tripartite slogan. “Stay sceptical. End the lockdown. Save lives.”Scepticism has a long and venerable history. From Descartes’s musings on metaphysics to Carl Sagan’s “fine art of baloney detection”, sceptics are unafraid to ask unpopular questions. Even if it means being branded a heretic.Journalists are inheritors of this fine intellectual tradition. It’s our job to call out the self-serving spin of the powerful to hold them to account. And from massaged Covid-19 testing rates to denialism about the crisis in our care homes, strong reasons for scepticism haven’t exactly been in short supply of late.But in the comment sections of some of the rightwing press, a new, virulent strain of Covid-19 scepticism has emerged that is the precise opposite of journalism. Rather than holding power to account, it distorts and bends reality to serve elite interests – and to warp public debate.In the pages of the Daily , the Spectator and other outlets, Britain’s contemporary “lockdown sceptics” have dedicated themselves to a singular cause: proving that the UK response to coronavirus has been a massive, hysterical overreaction. “Lift the lockdown” is their cogito ergo sum Sweden their promised land.Even as the coronavirus death toll has skyrocketed, the serried ranks of Britain’s lockdown sceptics have swelled. What was once largely the preserve of libertarians and professional contrarians now has supporters on the government benches and even, it appears, round the cabinet table.Britain’s self-appointed sceptics often look more like US-style culture warriors than critical thinkers. The lockdown – and the scientists advising caution – have become targets of their increasingly frenzied, partisan attacks.Young has been one of the loudest lockdown sceptics – while being across TV and radio stations complaining about how he’s been silenced. A personal brush with coronavirus has only emboldened him. “Coronavirus has turned us into a nation of scaredy-cats,” he declared in a column published the same day that the UK’s official death toll passed 31,500. (Young’s Lockdown Sceptics website even carries adverts from solicitors promising to advise anyone who “might have a legal case or claim over the government’s ‘lockdown’ regulations”.) Young is not alone. Newspaper columnists such as Allison Pearson blithely equate asking schoolchildren to wear face masks with child abuse. Shutting British pubs, meanwhile, is a deprivation of liberty comparable to Communist totalitarianism.Particular ire is reserved for a group of people whose profession is based on scepticism: scientists. The team at Imperial College London – whose modelling predicted as many as half a million coronavirus deaths in Britain without lockdown measures – have been accused of “crude mathematical guesswork”. (By, er, Matt Ridley who presided over the crash at Northern Rock.)When the  caught Neil Ferguson in breach of lockdown guidance, few were as cock-a-hoop as the paper’s columnists. On social media, anti-lockdown outriders presented the professor’s misdemeanours as evidence that his work was flawed. Imperial boffins had ruined the economy.It is no surprise that so many professional contrarians are paid-up lockdown sceptics. They are products of our distorted media ecosystem, which invariably privileges heat over light. For them, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about – even if what you are talking about amounts to social Darwinism.But the lockdown opponents are not just media “personalities”. Many of the Conservatives’ most generous donors have called for the economy to be reopened. (Because the views of party funders are, of course, a crucial consideration in a public health emergency.)Politicians have joined the chorus, too. David Davis – who still seems to believe that Brexit Britain will be saved by the political clout of German car manufacturers – has become a convert to the sceptic cause. The former cabinet minister Steve Baker has called on his prime minister to end the “absurd, dystopian and tyrannical lockdown”. Their colleague Daniel Kawczynski would like to see the Welsh Assembly abolished so his constituents can get to the seaside.How long before a British parliamentarian goes full “plandemic” and wonders aloud if Covid-19 is all a conspiracy? Nadine Dorries, Lucy Allan and Maria Caulfield have already shown a fondness for sharing far-right talking points. Whoever does will doubtless receive far more column inches than the attention-seeking Irish politician, Mattie McGrath, who asked last week if the pandemic was “a great con” and was roundly ignored in local media, save a savage lampooning.Polls suggest that lockdown scepticism is very much a minority sport, but recent British history shows how quickly fringe views can become mainstream. When the former MEP and prominent  columnist Daniel Hannan first got on board with Euroscepticism, it was a fringe concern. Now he is one of the guiding lights of Britain’s vote to leave the EU – and, as it happens, a vocal lockdown critic, who insouciantly proclaimed in February: “I’m going to stick my neck out here. You’re unlikely to be killed by the coronavirus.”The echoes of Brexit in all this aren’t hard to spot. The disavowal of expertise. The pitting of “the elite” against “the people”. It is striking that while by no means all Brexiters are lockdown sceptics, almost all lockdown sceptics are Brexiters. Having chastised the government for inaction in early March, Nigel Farage now demands a return to liberty for all. On social media, Brexit moneybags Arron Banks’s Leave.EU is among the most belligerent anti-lockdown voices.It is easy to dismiss the lockdown sceptics as a rag-tag bunch bound together by instinctive contrarianism, libertarian ideology, vested interests and a fear of a shift towards big state Conservatism. But they have already succeeded in shifting public discourse – far-right activists have been organising anti-lockdown demonstrations in London. We may come to a point where there is almost no “expertise” that cannot be somehow discredited by this brand of “scepticism”. And given the platform and power many of the people peddling it possess, they can attempt to make anyone look like a hypocrite or a useful idiot, undermining any sense of truth.There is so much to be rightly sceptical about right now. There is indeed plenty wrong with Britain’s lockdown. Our government has just given private tech firms “unprecedented” access to our personal health data. Consultancy giants have been awarded massive contracts for PPE and testing without any open tender process. And how have so many businesses been able to exploit loopholes in lockdown restrictions, forcing low-paid workers to work without adequate safety provision?These are the questions any self-respecting sceptic should be asking.Instead, the “lockdown sceptics” are hoping to win a narrative battle, to shape what comes next. Britain’s success – such as it is – in curtailing deaths will be adduced as proof that the lockdown restrictions were unnecessary. The experts cannot be trusted. The cure was worse than the disease.Carl Sagan would take one look at these contemporary sceptics and declare “baloney”. It is high time we did likewise.• Peter Geoghegan is investigations editor of openDemocracy and author of Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics, out in August.

It was a question of logistics – the capacity wasn’t there. In other words, Walport saw no failure of scientific advice to government ministers – simply a failure of people in labs and Public Health England to respond to the scientific advice.This is odd because on 15 March he was interviewed on Sky News and made no mention of a testing strategy to reduce transmission: he defended continuation of mass gatherings and the UK’s “world-class” modelling for the outbreak. Later, when interviewed again on 29 March, he said social distancing was the best way to reduce transmission and that testing was needed only for health workers, and for when outbreaks flared up. He also wanted a balance between “clamping down” and keeping the economy going. The best advice, he said, was “coming from the modelling community”.This question about testing policy is far more than a matter of bureaucratic sophistry. The government’s decision on 12 March, when the UK had 590 confirmed active cases and nine deaths, led to the uncontained explosion of the Covid-19 epidemic. Imperial College London researchers have estimated the baseline R value – the rate at which people are passing on infections to others – at that time to have been just below four. Between 12 and 24 March, when the national lockdown started, cases exploded. By 28 March, Imperial researchers estimate that more than 1.8 million people in Britain were infected. The official death toll in the UK from Covid-19 stands at nearly 35,000 people, though estimates from the Financial Times put the number of lives lost at more than 62,000.Grieving families need to know what advice was given and how it was acted on. I have repeatedly called for a rapid and no-blame audit of Sage advice, to take the pressure off its members, so that we can learn the lessons from the scientific debates that might have led to well-intentioned misjudgments.It’s clear that in the early stages of the outbreak, Sage was over-focused on using pandemic influenza as a guideline – a virus with a much lower death rate, a lower R value (around 1.3) and a short incubation period, which makes testing redundant. Its modelling and behavioural subcommittees were labelled with the prefix SPI – scientific pandemic influenza groups. And its rigid contain-delay-research-mitigate strategy comes from the influenza handbook. But this was coronavirus not flu. And it simply didn’t listen to advice from the World Health Organization’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, when declaring a pandemic on 11 March, said: “The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.”Understanding these discussions and decisions must come from the accurate, full and public release of the Sage meeting minutes from 28 January up to the present day. And from the evidence of Sage academics who volunteered their time and expertise. This can be done without blame or pointing fingers. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the minutes would be released when the epidemic is over – we are coming towards the end of the coronavirus surge, so that time is now.Sage has been bedevilled by a lack of transparency and balance. If independent public health experts had not been excluded from the core committee, which is dominated by modellers, virologists, clinical academics and behavioural scientists, the influenza-driven “herd immunity” strategy might not have materialised. If the blame is now subtly being shifted to public health colleagues by core members of Sage, then this heightens the necessity for full transparency. MPs and the scientific community should press for the unredacted release of meeting minutes immediately.Those minutes have assumed greater importance given the slow and fragmented response by the UK in mounting a sustainable and locally integrated system for finding, testing, tracing and isolating Covid-19 cases. Four months into this epidemic, we are not even close to having a system ready for lifting the lockdown. As an editorial in last week’s British Medical Journal declared: “Meaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, ert focus and could lead to more deaths.”The government has thus far provided the names of 60 contributors to Sage – but its core decision-making group should also be listed. Over the last two months, the British public has complied with social distancing meticulously. It has witnessed, at first hand, the greatest public health disaster in a century, and the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including more than 180 health workers and volunteers, and more than 200 care workers. The public deserves the hard data, scientific opinions and the minutes of Sage meetings – not recollections in the media from senior members – to help us all understand how we got here.• Anthony Costello is professor of global health at UCL, and a former director at the World Health Organization"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56998d320506377281b6550ee16c82887a9fa522/0_184_2666_1599/master/2666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce2137d1184944b77e37b8b3aafd641","title":"the guardian view on covid 19 and migration a ministerial power grab","story":"If the government gets its way, our coronavirus heroes may not be here to save us next timeWhy is the government pressing ahead with an immigration policy that was designed for a world that no longer exists? Brexit’s strident rhetoric posited falsehoods about migrant workers being behind depressed wages, housing shortages and stressed public services. But that was before coronavirus. Many Britons have woken up now to the fact that vital sectors in the NHS, social care and food production have been kept going by low-paid EU and non-European workers of the kind whose numbers the home secretary, Priti Patel, plans to restrict.Ms Patel’s immigration bill claims it is introducing a points-based system, but it is more an income-based one. She proposes to end freedom of movement from the EU and apply the same salary threshold and skills requirement to prospective migrants wherever they come from. The rules are due to take effect in January and it is estimated that two-thirds of EU migrants now classed as key workers would not qualify for a work visa next year. The bill fails because the crisis has shown that salary alone is a poor guide to a person’s value to society.The political argument for a tough regime is also fading. The public was warming to immigration before the pandemic struck and there was outrage over the injustice perpetuated on a generation of Caribbean migrants in the Windrush scandal. Polls show widespread public sympathy for low-paid foreign employees in the NHS and care sector.The economic case for revisiting the policy is even stronger. The coming recession is unlikely to make Britain attractive to migrants. Travel is also probably going to remain restricted, limiting the scope to find work. Foreign students, the lifeblood of many universities and the towns that house them, will not rush back to Britain. The disruption to travel is expected to be lasting: Airbus has cut plane production by a third. It’s hard to see the sense in continuing with a bill to limit immigration when the shutdown has done that anyway.In an era of high unemployment, jobs that British workers have been able to choose not to do might be more attractive than they previously were. There has been a jump in applications to work in the NHS during the pandemic. The government will need to put more money into training and pay. It is obvious why there are so few local workers in social care when – after a decade of local government austerity – hourly pay in a largely private sector is lower than in supermarkets.Ms Patel ought to be generous and relax the proposed restrictions. She could do so without incurring political cost, as polls show support to exempt lower-paid frontline migrant workers. She did not take the opportunity in the Commons on Monday. This was a mistake. It is also wrong for Ms Patel to force foreign health staff to pay extra to fund the NHS. Large-scale immigration changes rarely work as intended – and one this size delivered in just seven months looks no different. Labour’s Nick Thomas-Symonds was right to caution that widening the scope of ministerial sway over immigration amounted to an executive power grab.A blitzkrieg advance by ministers over immigration would be expected after Brexit, which remains the glue that holds Boris Johnson’s government together. But the Covid-19 pandemic has made the public understandably fearful. When people are anxious they tend to re-evaluate their beliefs. The shock of the virus has opened the political conversation to ideas beyond Brexit about what sort of society will work for all. For the sake of the country, the government ought to embrace them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1f9528877d89ff3a50de0f2aaae5813ff0c294/0_107_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4832b233b984d01715388fa329eace2a","title":"we should be overhauling the school system not rushing to send children back","story":"The ease with which exams were ditched shows that we could craft a model built around emotional and social development, not constant invigilationThe hierarchy of who cares most about lovely little children is confusing. Parents, I would have thought, are up there. Except the bad ones who are not home schooling, have not bought several laptops and are frantically trying to manage working at home, too.Then there are the awful ones who have to go out to work. Do they not care? Some, like me, have sacrificed their children for their political principles and sent their kids to state schools. I always love this phrase: it is wonderful that my children are still alive despite my attempt to serve them up as offerings to the fake household gods of fairness.Then there are the teachers who could be “heroes”, but are reverting to type as some kind of communists as they do not want schools to open just yet. Strangely, they are supported by many doctor heroes, who we presume do care.I heard an interview with a teacher who is also a parent and does not feel safe going back to work. I nearly malfunctioned, because, in the current discourse, this is a category error. Good teacherbad parent or bad teachergood parent?Even though I have tried to stay alert, I need some guidelines about who is the enemy of the people now. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, doing “caring” is alarming enough. “We owe it to the children” to open schools, apparently. Then along comes Michael Gove, who told local authorities unsure about all this: “If you really care about children, you’ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.”I can only conclude that I don’t really care about children, then, because, no, I don’t want kids to be in primary school by 1 June. Nor do people in many other parts of the UK, especially where the virus is still to peak. This date is only a target in England, with Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish schools all expected to reopen after the summer holidays. Many teachers are worried not only for themselves, but also for what they might pass on to their families many parents do not want their children used in an experiment on contagion.As far as we know, children tend not to suffer badly with the virus, while a study in Australia has suggested that they are not significant vectors of infection. But that is one study and “the science” is an ever-expanding, moving body. We do not know enough.We do know, however, that the physical distancing required seems almost impossible with the youngest schoolchildren. Do we pick them up when they fall over? Why can they bring in lunch boxes but not pencil cases? All these details have to be ironed out in very little time.Of course I see that year 6s and primary 7s need to say goodbye to their friends before they move on to secondary school. Of course I see that teachers can identify the most vulnerable kids in reception, year 1 and primary 1. But none of this is to do with education as such. Schools have to be reopened as giant creches to get adults back to work so the economy can go back to “normal”.This is an illusion of control and normality from a government that has failed to care. Education has always been one way in which the elite has bypassed the state. The NHS cannot be bypassed, because private medicine provides few ICUs. Teachers are a far easier group to demonise. Gove was always at war with “the Blob”, egged on by his overextended Spads, such as Henry de Zoete. He got burnt out working for Gove and once tried a week teaching in a primary school: “I realised that I couldn’t do it.” Really? I thought any fool could teach.Reopening schools requires trust between local authorities, teachers and parents, but the government is packed full of those who have systematically undermined that trust and denigrated teaching. Telling people they are safe is not the same as making them feel safe.Now is the time to re-evaluate the ideology that has driven the system. The sudden ditching of exams may have repercussions, but the ease with which it was done could point us in a new direction. We want to get children back to school for their social wellbeing as well as for their consumption of information. Kids miss their friends.We need to ask what education is for. Lockdown has exacerbated every inequality. Richer families spend much more time on schoolwork than poorer ones and are more likely to send their kids back to school. We hold on to the idea that education is the route out of poverty, but school is only one factor in this.The emotional and social development of our children is paramount, not a rushed, unsafe return to constant invigilation. Teachers are not childminders, nor are they risk-averse. You try standing up in front of 30 15-year-olds.As a strategy, alienating “the Blob” is as dumb as comparing the virus to a mugger to be rugby tackled. But what do I know? I have not had the benefit of the most physically distanced form of education – a top boarding school. Strangely, these will not be required to open in two weeks’ time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6070189afe34a01d9f6ded51f28270fc2a12c4c/0_188_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfd9b9527ad0d3e42c387f667170fc4e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of treasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘treasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘treasure’.Share your photos of what treasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 May at 10am.

It also notes there is some, albeit very limited evidence, that such children are less likely to become infected than adults, but it is unclear whether they transmit the virus less than adults.The report also acknowledges other countries: many in Europe have begun reopening schools with few problems, at least so far. Indeed the secretary of state for education, Gavin Williamson, has previously highlighted the lack of negative impacts in Denmark, where schools reopened in mid-April.However, experts found the “R” number – the effective reproduction number – did nudge upwards towards 1 in the first two weeks of reopening in Denmark before falling once again, while some have said that comparisons with Denmark are problematic, with Denmark having had far fewer deaths (under 550 at the time of writing).Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said that another consideration is that there have been few recorded cases of adults catching the disease from children, while there have been no outbreaks in schools around the world – although that could be down to children showing few symptoms. But, he said, teachers may be at risk from other teachers – as is the case between workers in other jobs.The new report notes it is very difficult for young children to stay 2 metres apart, but says measures such as hand washing and emphasising the need to use and bin tissues are important.Frequent cleaning of surfaces, using staggered break times and changing classroom layouts could be used – although each school is asked to carry out its own risk assessment before opening.Face masks or coverings, however, are not recommended, with the report noting that children and staff in schools will only mix in small and consistent groups. Teachers will not be expected to use personal protective equipment (PPE) unless that is already used, or a child develops symptoms of Covid-19 and contact is necessary while they are cared for before returning home.The Department for Education has said that all schoolchildren, staff and members of their households will be able to have a test for Covid-19 – if they show symptoms. If children or staff test positive, all those they mix with in the school will have to self-isolate for 14 days. However as the report itself notes, many children have very mild symptoms or none at all.No. As Boris Johnson outlined in his address on 10 May, the plan refers to England and the first children to return will be children in nurseries, reception and year 1, as well as those in the last year of primary school, year 6. These groups, it has been mooted, will return on 1 June, while other schoolchildren will return to classrooms in the weeks that follow – however this timetable is provisional.Children or staff with pre-exisiting medical conditions that could make them very vulnerable to Covid-19 will not be expected to return to school.Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, said these particular age groups had largely been picked to return on “educational and welfare grounds”.There has been a small number of cases around the world of children with a potentially deadly inflammatory syndrome that has been linked to Covid-19. However experts have stressed it is rare, affecting only one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus.Dr Liz Whittaker, a clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, has previously said the condition “shouldn’t be a factor when we reopen the schools”.Michael Tildesley of Warwick University, who works on models of the spread of diseases, said it was a possibility, depending on what happens with R. “If we do start to see the reproduction number going above 1 and cases climbing again we should be prepared to take the decision to close schools again,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5635a8a6d76d18782ddac40068a00b63d59ff219/0_189_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ba69a77869a76ae9cf14ac9ffbfdf83","title":"marking books not safe suggests new coronavirus guidance for teachers","story":"Councils warn parents not to expect schools to open on 1 June as government prepares for union talksA growing number of councils in England are warning parents not to expect schools to open on 1 June, as new union guidance for teachers suggests it will not be safe to mark children’s books.Bury council in Greater Manchester is the latest to confirm that primary schools will not reopen for some pupils on the government’s target date at the start of next month, pointing out that Covid-19 infections in the area are still too high.Tamoor Tariq, lead member for children’s services, schools and families, said: “While high levels of Covid-19 infection in the north-west remain, and guidance around practical arrangements for social distancing within educational environments, testing and tracing, and supply of PPE is unclear, the borough will not be reopening schools on 1 June.”The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will meet union leaders on Tuesday, as pressure builds on government to reopen primary schools in England to reception, year 1 and year 6.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which represents 19,000 members, said it would – with some caveats – support schools preparing to reopen from that date, after being reassured by government scientific advisers last week.A number of multi-academy trusts, which are independent of local authorities and close to government, have also supported the 1 June return to school. A growing number of councils including Liverpool, Hartlepool, Rochdale and Wigan have, however, told parents not to expect schools to reopen on the government’s deadline.Stockport council, also in Greater Manchester, has said its schools will not be ready to reopen to more pupils until 10 June at the earliest, while Slough council in Berkshire warned its parents many schools in the borough would not be accepting more children until 8 June.Brighton and Hove city council also wrote to parents and carers on Monday warning of possible delays to reopening because of safety concerns. “The council’s advice is that education provision in Brighton and Hove should only reopen to more children when education leaders are confident that it is safe for the children and staff. This may not fit with the expectations or timescales outlined by government,” the letter said.Meanwhile in Essex the county council told parents that some schools may not be able to offer full-time provision for the year groups identified by the government to return first, adding that “any new arrangements may not be introduced exactly from the 1st June”.Fresh guidance for teachers from the country’s biggest teaching union suggests it will not be safe to mark children’s books and renews calls for PPE in schools.The National Education Union (NEU), with 45,000 members, remains unconvinced by government assurances and has issued its own guidance to primary schools, warning it is “extremely unlikely” that circumstances nationally would allow for wider reopening on 1 June.Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the advice from the Sage committee on the return of schools would be published “as soon as possible”, giving no timeframe. “We continue to want to work with schools in order to get more children back into an education setting,” he said.“We are now past the peak of the virus and it is right that we plan for the first phase of a controlled and careful return of some year groups from 1 June at the earliest. As we have always said, safety comes first, but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a child’s education from not getting them back to the classroom.”On the ground, headteachers say government ambitions to get all primary children back into school for a month before the school holidays are “unworkable”. There are also concerns that parents will be too scared to send their children to school, particularly those who are BAME because of mounting evidence that members of ethnic minority groups are particularly badly affected by the virus.Paul Harris, chief executive of the Tapscott Learning Trust which runs five primary schools in the east London borough of Newham, which had the worst mortality rate in England and Wales, said parents in his community were “very, very scared”. There have been 15 deaths from Covid among the families of staff and pupils in the Tapscott community.“When you knock on the door, all the curtains are shut. Parents will talk to you on the phone, but some of them won’t open the door. When you talk to them on the phone they make it very clear they have not been assured enough that it’s safe,” he said.The NEU meanwhile has urged its members to insist on social distancing of 2 metres in schools, though government guidance has acknowledged young children will find it impossible to observe the same rules as adults and advises instead classes of fewer than 15 and well spaced desks.The NEU guidance says: “Given that the science does not yet show that children do not transmit the virus, the NEU believes that schools should operate in the same way as other workplaces and maintain social distancing in classrooms and in movement around the school.”The guidance, which is also for members of GMB, Unite and Unison working in schools, provides a comprehensive checklist, including advice on everything from lidded bins to sanitising library books. At one point it says: “It will not be safe to mark children’s books during this period. Will clear instruction be given that no marking should take place and the books should not be taken to and from homeschool?”Schools in England have been closed to all pupils, except children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, since 20 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6259d3d48c6c56e5004ec0d6593a923f71392175/0_410_6530_3918/master/6530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1e43eb429cd8717d9398a899cef53db","title":"i had two separate lives lgbt teachers learn to speak up and get promotion","story":"A year-long scheme to train LGBT staff to be themselves, Courageous Leaders, is transforming teachers’ prospects - and their schools Like many LGBT teachers, Bradley Saunders learned to live a double life. To his close friends and family he was a young gay man in a steady relationship, while at the primary school where he worked his home life was a secret. He avoided questions about weekends, pretended to go on holiday with his family, and did not take his partner to school social events.So when after four years he moved to a job as director of learning for the Hearts academy trust, and was approached by one of the trust’s teachers, Jane Robinson, about leadership training for LGBT teachers, his first thought was to turn her down.“I had my school life and my home life and I was very happy with that. I perceived them as two separate entities,” he says. “Then I thought, as I was aiming for headship maybe I would get some useful CPD out of the course, so I put my name down.” The course – the Courageous Leaders programme – set up in 2016 by Robinson, head of Hilltop Infant school, in Wickford, Essex, with money from the Department for Education’s equality and ersity fund, changed his life and helped him gain promotion. He is now head of two of the trust’s primary schools, Waterman primary and Stambridge primary, in Rochford, Essex he no longer hides his sexual orientation, and acts as a mentor on the programme.“It was only when I was put on the spot in a circle of people on the Courageous Leaders programme that I realised I was not being my true self,” says Saunders, 30. “We talked about different scenarios, such as whether you would bring your partner to the summer fete. I said no, I wouldn’t do – my partner is my home life and school is my job.“‘Why is it all right for the teacher next door to take their partner, but not you?’ I was asked. It challenged my thought processes and I realised that if I wanted to become an authentic leader I had to be open. By keeping my worlds separate, I wouldn’t achieve it.“I also felt a responsibility to the children to ensure that the teaching staff represented society,” he says.On paper, the UK is one of the world’s most liberal societies. Same-sex couples can marry, adopt children, enter into civil partnerships and can claim legal protection against discrimination from the 2010 Equality Act. In 2005 transgender people finally got the legal right to change gender.But the legacy of the Thatcher government’s section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, repealed in 2003, lives on. It essentially forbade schools and local authorities from acknowledging that gay people existed, and even today high-profile cases of gay teachers being hounded by religious groups create a climate of fear.Robinson, who had hidden her own sexuality when she started teaching in the 1980s, started the Courageous Leaders programme because she believed LGBT teachers were missing out on promotion, as they were afraid to put their heads above the parapet.The year-long programme involves three days of face-to-face training, including lectures, guest speakers and workshops, with the aim of instilling leadership skills and boosting confidence through sharing experiences and mutual support.She summarises the success in a new book, Courage in the Classroom, that includes chapters by lesbian, gay and transgender teachers about overcoming prejudice and learning to be themselves.“At the end of the year, all but one of our 15 courageous leaders on the course had gained promotion,” she says. “They wanted support to acquire the skills to achieve that but, more importantly, they wanted a safe space to discuss their vulnerabilities, with colleagues who understood exactly how they felt about their sexuality and its impact on their career.” Catherine Lee, deputy dean for education at Anglia Ruskin University and the book’s editor, and also a leader on the programme, says changes to protect minorities at the macro level do not necessarily mean teachers feel any safer, or are included in their staffrooms and classrooms. She is donating profits from the book to the programme.“At the university we work with hundreds of schools and I am not aware of more than a handful of LGBT teachers in head or deputy-head roles. This is what the course is addressing,” says Lee, who left teaching in 2010 after a 20-year career when a parent claimed she was a bad influence for living with a female partner.“They are likely to live outside the catchment area, they don’t go to social events, they sometimes even avoid the staffroom because they don’t want to talk about what they did at the weekend,” she says.“What those on the Courageous Leaders course tell us they appreciate most are the networking opportunities, being able to check in with each other and get support. If there had been a group like that when I was teaching in schools it would have helped tremendously.” One LGBT teacher mentioned in the book is Catherine Halliwell, who helped students set up an LGBT society at her girls’ grammar school, Nonsuch in Sutton, Surrey.“I got an email from 15-year-old students asking if I would support them setting up an LGBT society. It was very much student-led and had a big impact. It didn’t all happen at once, lots of little steps added up and now we have a pride week in July with LGBT flags in reception and an LGBT film festival,” Halliwell says.The society’s founder, Cerian Craske, 20, now studying English at Cambridge, recalls it started with about 20 girls meeting in an IT room on a Wednesday lunchtime.“Then we put on things such as the big gay bake sale and it really took off and attracted girls of all ages and their friends, who came to support them,” she says. “It was an amazing thing for the school to support LGBT students and teachers so they were able to be themselves. It was so important to me that I could see an adult who was LGBT and having a happy life.”Alex Townsend, deputy head of Bedford sixth form college, attributes his promotion in January to the confidence he gained on the course to be himself.“I jumped from business studies teacher straight to deputy head and I can’t credit the programme enough for what it did to show me that I could use my ersity positively, rather than hide it,” says Townsend, 31.“The biggest thing for me was the very first five minutes of the first day when I found myself in a room full of gay teachers for the first time. That would have been profound in itself, without all the training we had and the amazing speakers.” He says: “I never used to be comfortable wearing a rainbow. I’m ambitious and I had always resisted the idea that my sexual orientation could inform any part of my progress through life. To my detriment, I had gone to the other extreme by not allowing it to be part of it in any way.“All that changed when I met other people on the course. I came back to college and started an LGBT social group for students and then set up a scheme of LGBT pastoral support officers. I don’t have to walk down the street in a parade to make a difference – I can do it where I work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a96bb755c2a7ffc9629e0bd5c863277b679baab/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85250ca977db445cab1d69afc6d09cec","title":"coronavirus offers chance to create fairer uk food supply chain say experts","story":"A radical 10-year plan should draw on community crisis responses to fix ‘faultlines in our food system’A radical 10-year recovery plan for the UK food system should draw on local and community responses to the Covid-19 crisis to create a more erse, sustainable and fairer supply chain, say experts.The pandemic exposed fragility in the food supply system: farmers poured away more than a million litres of milk, supermarket shelves were stripped of flour while millers were unable to sell it, and potato farmers were forced to hoard stocks. Meanwhile, food banks faced unprecedented demand as household incomes plummeted.Sue Pritchard, the chief executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission, said: “The pandemic has exposed the faultlines in our food system.“We’ve seen big gaps in availability of food, especially for the poor and vulnerable, and significant economic impacts on producers. This crisis demonstrates that people and business are ready to build back better.”Prof Tim Lang, whose new book Feeding Britain exposes the fragility of the UK food system before Covid-19 struck, said the crisis has concentrated power even more into the hands of the supermarkets.“This reduced economic ersity by hammering other supply chains and wasted vast resources. It’ll be hard to rein back this concentration of power.”The crisis in food supplies caused by the pandemic came as the agriculture bill, the biggest change to British agriculture and food production since 1945, was reaching its final stages in the House of Commons.The Tenant Farmers Association is calling for the bill’s introduction to be delayed until 2022 while farmers, producers and experts reflect on the problems exposed by the pandemic.An inquiry has been set up by the environment, food and rural affairs committee to analyse how Covid-19 has affected the food system. In its evidence, the TFA said the crisis exposed how inflexible the system was. Farmers who supplied to restaurants and takeaways had their outlets cut off, and were unable to ert their produce to people who needed it.“At a time when consumers were queueing up at retailers keen to buy meat, dairy and fresh produce, it was unacceptable that this demand was unfulfilled despite the fact that sufficient quantities of food were available in the country.”The TFA said the government had handed the monopoly to supermarkets in response to the crisis but the retailers had done little to change their buying patterns and source food from farmers whose markets had dried up. Some supermarkets sourced meat from Poland while British farmers were forced to stockpile.Pritchard said there were many examples of resilience in local communities which emphasised the need to build a more erse food system.Feedback, an environmental charity, said: “There is a chance for the government to treat this moment of crisis as an opportunity to reshape supply chains in ways that will be helpful in the long-term for supporting producers and reducing the environmental impacts of food production.”It is calling for the creation of a national food service to create a joined up and equitable approach to preparing and distributing meals at the local and community level.Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation, said the Covid-19 pandemic was having a material impact on what millions of adults and children were able to eat.“We desperately need a social security system which protects everyone’s right to good food, now and in the future. The system must support those who have gone into this crisis already struggling, and the millions more who have been added to their number. What we eat remains fundamentally important for our health: we need to rebuild our food system so that good food, which helps us stay healthy, is the norm.”Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, which is calling for legal guarantees against imports from countries such as the the US with lower environmental and animal welfare standards, said the government must support British farmers. “There will be a danger – and this will be a continuing danger – that as we come back to normality, we do not want to see other product dumped on this marketplace,” she said in evidence to the environment, food and rural affairs committee.“I think that is a very live challenge. Government getting behind the ‘buy British’ message, and loving British food, is incredibly important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6a7b1114b0bd28ac94570b8c206c4d722893e3b/0_307_2002_1200/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e36123acf80da7e6313681957d21796","title":"turning the meat industry upside down a day with germanys travelling butcher coronavirus","story":"With ever larger meat plants in the spotlight over coronavirus clusters, one butcher has profited by going in the opposite directionInside the white trailer parked up by the farm, the small team headed by Matthias Kürten are moving fast.Their work has a rhythmical soundtrack: a bandsaw cutting through bones, fat slopped into buckets, murmurs of chatter and knives being sharpened. Diced meat for stew, steaks, soup stock, mince and liver are sealed with the inhale of a vacuum-packer, stamped by a sticker machine, and land in plastic crates with a thud.Ten days earlier Kürten had come to the farm and slaughtered seven cows and calves the carcasses are hanging in a nearby cooling wagon. Now his team are back to process the meat. Kürten, a softly spoken man with a ready laugh, is Germany’s only mobile butcher: a one-stop shop for livestock slaughter and meat processing.In Germany, slaughterhouses – as they are in the US and elsewhere in Europe – are increasingly being seen as coronavirus hotspots, as hundreds of workers have tested positive across the country in recent weeks. A plant in Dissen, Lower Saxony, is the latest to close after 92 workers tested positive.The cases have thrown the industry into the spotlight – particularly the close working and living conditions for employees. The federal government will this week discuss stricter measures to reduce the spread of the virus.But so far the coronavirus hasn’t impacted Kürten’s business. “We actually have more work,” he says. “Our customers are buying more.” Partly he thinks people want to stock up and buy more to distribute among friends to help them out. Cleaning products have been harder to get hold of, but being a smaller operation means it’s easier to maintain safe distancing.Founded in 2002, Kürten’s butcher is a curious anomaly in an industry characterised by ever greater economies of scale. Around the world slaughterhouses are getting fewer and bigger. “We are doing the exact opposite,” Kürten reflects, a saw wedged in a swaying carcass at his side. “And it’s working really well.”Over the course of a year he visits roughly 350 farms, usually slaughtering one to four cows, two or three pigs and as many as 38 sheep on each, and butchering them to the farmers’ specifications – often, as is the case today, with their help.At the heart of his business lies the conviction that animals should be slaughtered on the farm. “This means they are calm,” he says. “They can eat up until the last moment. Mostly they don’t understand what is happening at all.”This is why farmers such as Andrea Schmitz, who has been a client for a decade, chooses Kürten over the cheaper alternative of an industrial slaughterhouse. “The animals are born here in the barn with us and run around our fields … They aren’t driving off in a truck,” she says.Earlier this year the  reported that as the live animal export trade booms across Europe, animals are travelling ever-longer distances, while the European Commission is failing to fully implement its own transport welfare regulations. Longer journeys are linked to a trend across Europe for fewer and larger slaughterhouses, run by an increasingly small number of large commercial players.“In Germany we have a very strong concentration in the slaughtering industry,” says Katrin Wenz, from Friends of the Earth Germany. A few smaller slaughterhouses can still be found in states such as Lower Saxony, she adds, but in places like Brandenburg companies have to transport animals over long distances. More than half the pigs in Germany, for example, are slaughtered by just three companies.“It became increasingly hard for smaller companies to compete,” says Wenz, citing low profit margins and high EU requirements. “More and more gave up because the big industrial slaughterhouses could slaughter increasingly cheaply and efficiently.”He believes, like many others, that the key turning point was the EU  hygiene  regulations that came into force in 2006. Kürten was able to find enough investment to ensure his business could comply with the new standards but many, he recalls, gave up. And while he still feels the pressure of high costs – including machinery and vets to oversee slaughter – Kürten says the business keeps growing. He’s booked up months ahead.Kürten points to the Natur Fleisch (natural meat) stickers on the packages. It describes, he says, the personal relationships between the customer, farm and butcher, and that the product comes from animals “that in the summer are able to stand in the field”.“An email is sent out saying a cow has been slaughtered and five hours later everything will be sold,” he says. “And this is sent locally, among a circle of friends and acquaintances – not throughout Germany.” Nothing, he’s happy to say, ends up in the supermarket.In recent years the German slaughterhouse industry has been criticised for low pay and poor working conditions, particularly for the thousands of eastern European migrant workers it employs.“One of the biggest challenges for the slaughter industry today, as it will be in the next 10–15 years, is finding enough staff,” says Thomas Bernhard, from the German Union of Food and Catering.In a series of interviews with German slaughterhouse workers, sociologist Marcel Sebastian at the Europa-Universität Flensburg, documented how they perceived the cultural shift from honest craft to source of moral stigma. “They struggled with this dramatic shift in public perception,” says Sebastian.While many see him as a curious niche, Kürten remains optimistic. Dozens of red crates are filling up in preparation for tomorrow’s customers – a startling amount from a few animals. Kürten finds particular satisfaction in wasting as little as possible.Shiva, his portly dog, follows him as he works, eagerly awaiting scraps. Kürten works six days a week, and it will be dusk before he attaches the trailer to his car and drives home to his second rottweiler, Achilles. Is he concerned about more people rejecting meat altogether in the future?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbf5e130d0d1d1c9d49292ce3dc809b098432bd7/0_0_5636_3383/master/5636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c22d3828e69036f9de094a5715d58e81","title":"renewable energy investors increasingly look to uk says report","story":"Decision to lift blocks on wind and solar projects has boosted ‘attractiveness’ rankingThe UK has become more attractive to renewable energy investors following the government’s decision to lift its block on financial support for onshore wind and solar projects.Britain has climbed the rankings of a biannual global survey of investors to take the sixth spot in EY’s “attractiveness index” for renewable energy ahead of a major clean energy auction next year.The auditing giant said the government’s decision to include onshore wind and solar energy projects in the auction had helped the UK climb one rung on the rankings list, to just below Germany, Australia, France, China and the US.The US topped the rankings for the first time since 2016 – in spite of the federal government’s ongoing support for fossil fuels – in large part due to plans to invest $57bn (£47bn) to install up to 30GW of offshore wind by 2030.China has fallen from the top of the rankings to second place as Beijing looks to wean the market off subsidies, and the coronavirus pandemic cut its growing appetite for energy.“Certainly, renewable energy is not immune to the economic disruption being wrought,” said Ben Warren, the author of EY’s report. “But many of these effects are likely to be short-term. Already, manufacturers in China and Europe are restarting production. Utilities have worked hard to keep generation going in difficult circumstances. And power demand will rebound as economies get back to work.”He said investors remain confident in “the long-term picture for clean energy”.“The need, after the pandemic, to ensure greater economic and social resilience will work in favour of distributed power sources, such as wind and solar, and the applications offered by battery storage,” he said.The UK’s decision to remove a block against onshore wind projects earlier this year followed a government pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050 – a feat that its official climate advisers believe will require a tripling of the UK’s onshore wind-power capacity in the next 15 years.Renewable energy developers are working towards the 2021 auction, despite the uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic, to help spur a green economic recovery once lockdown measures are lifted.Luke Clark, of RenewableUK, said EY’s report is right to highlight the economic opportunity offered by renewables after the pandemic.“Our sector’s plans to invest tens of billions of pounds in vital new energy infrastructure all over the country have not changed, and the government is supporting our work as it remains committed to reaching its legally-binding target of net zero emissions,” he said.“The UK’s low-carbon economy will stimulate new growth, boost productivity and support tens of thousands of jobs as we work on projects at home and secure new export opportunities around the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c623a6553b58c9e09af0253483569b9fc8b20c95/0_156_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29a6270c6ba535443fe8fd80529ca731","title":"what we wear now instagram live styling session","story":"With lockdown set to move into the summer, the ’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, and the Observer’s fashion editor, Jo Jones, answer your questions on how to dress for nowFor those of us working from home, or juggling childcare with a job, the pandemic has arguably redefined the way we dress.

His robust, rugged looks were not quite like Gabin’s, and certainly a world away from the smouldering sexiness of Belmondo or the ethereal beauty of Delon. He could play a lost soul, a man with secrets, a predator, a sensualist, a politician, an artist, a leader of men. In both his youth and age he was intensely masculine in an unadorned and ungroomed way, the male version of jolie-laide, perhaps. Piccoli was beau-laid or beau-moche, and destructively sexy with it.Perhaps nowadays only Vincent Cassel comes close to Piccoli’s ability to project and dramatise a fierce detachment and self-reliance – and Piccoli’s was the ideal face for conveying contempt, the concept at the heart of Le Mépris, the 1963 film by Jean-Luc Godard. Without that role, he might have been condemned to play forever the kind of supporting roles — interesting, but not the sort to make one’s name — of the sort that Jean-Pierre Melville had given him in Le Doulos, or The Stoolpigeon, in 1962, the creepy club-owner that Belmondo’s tough-guy tries to frame for a cop killing.In Le Mépris, he is Paul, a talented young dramatist who gets the chance for big money with a commission to write the screenplay for a new movie version of Homer’s Odyssey (a drama crucially about adventure and infidelity), to be directed by Fritz Lang (playing himself) and produced by a brash American mogul played by Jack Palance. Paul is contemptuous of the whole crassly commercial business and his wife Camille (famously played by Brigitte Bardot) is contemptuous of him for appearing to use her charms to ingratiate himself with the producer. Piccoli’s long, complex, opaque dialogue scenes with Bardot epitomise Godard’s own fraught and angry relationship both with women and with cinema’s seductive sexiness, as well as the hidden transactions and abasements that come with film-making. Piccoli’s own face portrayed this with great sophistication: it was the face of disillusion, of not-so-secret misogyny, and yet a far-from-satisfied appetite for success. For Hitchcock in Topaz (1969) he played a Soviet spymaster — a role which was a gift for Piccoli’s mastery of unattractive people in charge, though it wasn’t the most interesting work from either Piccoli or Hitchcock. In Buñuel’s Belle de Jour (1967), Piccoli is the disagreeable cynic and married flirt Husson, a friend of the man married to Catherine Deneuve, and it is from this slippery and insinuating Husson and his indiscreetly chattering wife that Deneuve learns of the existence of maisons which men visit for risk-free sex, and in a way it is Husson who indirectly inspires her need to become a secret high-class daytime escort. Piccoli’s coolly unconcerned figure is the embodiment of every pimp, every customer, every blandly corrupt police chief that presides over the whole business. Piccoli was to return as questionable and preposterous authority figures in Buñuel movies like The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) and The Phantom of Liberty (1974).Another surreal extravaganza was the notorious La Grande Bouffe (1973) in which Piccoli features as a jaded television producer who, with three other equally disillusioned and self-important men, gather in a restaurant with the express purpose of eating themselves to death. Piccoli’s air of ennui and suppressed distaste, made him obvious casting for this scabrous satire, but in my view it doesn’t have the interest and poetry of Buñuel.For Claude Sautet, he made five very well-regarded movies, of which arguably the best was Vincent, François, Paul et les Autres (1974), a somewhat American-style indie picture with something of Mazursky or Cassavetes: a four-way male-midlife drama which holds up better than La Grande Bouffe, with Piccoli playing opposite those equally lionised European movie-alphas Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu and Serge Reggiani. They are four friends who are undergoing menopausal crises in parallel, with Piccoli as the disenchanted doctor alienated from both his marriage and his vocation. The sadness and loneliness of these kinds of role were beginning to be the keynote for Piccoli now.Perhaps Piccoli was an actor who was destined to grow into his looks, and he had a very characteristically cast as the ageing artist Frenhofer in Jacques Rivette’s La Belle Noiseuse (1991), adapted from Balzac, with Piccoli as the artist whose creative fires are rekindled by the beautiful (and often naked) model and muse, played by Emmanuel Béart: a very male fantasy.For Agnes Varda, in her One Hundred And One Nights (1995) he is cinema itself –Simon Cinema – who hires a young woman (Julie Gayet) to regale him with stories to rekindle his knowledge and memory of film. It is a very flamboyant, exuberant, theatricalised performance and this marked the moment when Piccoli became someone to be liked and even loved. Perhaps more than any other actor of his generation, he continued to work with extraordinary dedication in any number of European movies and co-productions and became an icon in the process, sometimes almost islanded in his own mythic reputation. Perhaps the weirdest and most piquant example of this was his enigmatic appearance in Manoel de Oliveira’s I’m Going Home in 2001, as an ageing actor devastated when his wife, daughter and son-in-law are killed and he is personally and professionally adrift, bizarrely miscast as Buck Mulligan in a new version of Joyce’s Ulysses. Piccoli carries off the strange wrongness of these scenes with placid, almost saintly dignity, and for all its pure eccentricity I think this is my favourite Piccoli performance. He is starting to show the heartwrenching and even tragic figure of someone who is poised on the edge of departing the screen, and this is certainly the case with his very lovable and charming performance as the reluctant pontiff in Moretti’s flawed satire We Have a Pope (2011).Michel Piccoli was the fiercest, strongest flavour in European movies and he was the actor whose career showed a gradual lightening: he played villains, then complicated and defeated men of the world, on the edge of despair and misanthropy, but with a kind of stubborn idealism – and then in old age he was the object of cinephile fan-worship: a legend of cinema."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f5fda31529df6e01d0bed40477d5eceffba27b/85_0_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae67d5311474b9399772a3e6c15f955d","title":"how coronavirus has animated one section of the film industry","story":"Animators tend to work alone – an attractive prospect for producers battling the coronavirus lockdown Fans of US drama The Blacklist may have been surprised to find graphic animation interspersed among the live action scenes in the season finale on Friday, after producers turned to special effects to get the episode on air after the coronavirus lockdown halted filming.As the TV and film industry agrees coronavirus safety measures to safely restart shooting mothballed shows and films in the UK – from Line of Duty to The Batman – the animation and special effects industry has remained at full capacity with surging demand.Unlike their live action counterparts, animators can work in isolation. It is common for animators and special effects staff to work in groups remotely around the world. This allows them to avoid the coronavirus concerns affecting live shoots, such as how to maintain physical distancing. Such an advantage makes animation work an alternative for schedulers and audiences as broadcasters and multiplexes scramble for fresh content.While live action production of movies and TV shows has ground to a halt, animated film productions including SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, Paw Patrol: The Movie, Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon and The Boss Baby 2 are all still powering ahead.When the lockdown eases cinema-goers will initially be spoiled with a glut of completed blockbusters that have had their release dates put on hold, from Disney’s Mulan to James Bond’s No Time To Die. But a significant break in TV and movie production, coupled with a new world of concerns about live action filming, could fuel a boom in demand for animation and special-effects led films and shows.Framestore and its 2,500 global staff are working on productions including James Gunn’s Suicide Squad, the live action-animation hybrid Tom and Jerry, Netflix’s A Boy Called Christmas and George Clooney sci-fi The Midnight Sky.However, many films that require some animation or effects still rely on live action filming to be completed. The producers of The Blacklist got around the lockdown by requiring the actors to record some new dialogue from home.The live action filming of Tom and Jerry, due out 23 December, had just finished before shutdown, allowing Framestore to finish the animation in the film. “We got lucky there,” admits Webber. “And with Midnight Sky, which just completed principal photography, it just got in under the wire.”Christian Manz, the special effects supervisor on JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts films, the latest of which has delayed filming at Warner Brother’s Leavesden studios due to the virus, says there are limits to replacing actors.Trolls World Tour, an animated film completed before the shutdown and destined for a global cinema release, made Universal Studios $100m (£81m) in three weeks after its release on streaming services in the US – more than the studio made from the first film’s five month run in US cinemas.With film and TV schedules facing up to two years to get back to full strength, it looks set to be the animated sector’s time to shine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a35af141e25dd4cef06d8eb0cbf8243f4da36e/0_69_4832_2898/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0ecb05ea6674e1ce22636b158c0eace","title":"michel piccoli a life in pictures","story":"The prolific actor Michel Piccoli, who has died aged 94, acted in dozens of films for virtually every major French director across seven decades, including Godard, Malle and Rivette here are some of the highlightsPeter Bradshaw on Michel Piccoli: a fierce, strong performer who became the object of cinephile fan-worship"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4688e3f54a96fac4e92b9825170791681e713afd/0_538_6015_3611/master/6015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937edaffb2a528e71aae7fdf70c3ff34","title":"nigel slaters top 10 spring recipes","story":"His best-loved dishes that make the most of what we have right now: shoulder of lamb, haddock fishcakes, banana tarts with cardamom creamMaybe I should stand still more often. A few moments to stop and take stock of what I have a time to curb my appetite for the new. I have certainly had the opportunity to do that in the kitchen over the past few weeks: slowly working through what I already have in the house, the freezer (not a lot to be honest) and the garden. I wouldn’t say it has been a bad thing.It has been something of a relief to clear the decks – I finally got the dried black beans out of the cupboard finished off the annoying packet of mixed rice (never buy mixed varieties of rice in one packet, they all cook at different times) and I finally demolished that giant box of nougat but only because my favourite chocolate shop was closed. I’m setting my sights on finding a use for the jar of amaranth next.Making the most of what I have has also led me on a trip through my old recipes. Some of which I cook regularly and know by heart, others I rather wish I made more often and the odd one or two I had genuinely forgotten about. I have collected together a whole bunch of my favourites: a neat package of recipes I love and feel are perfect for the unpredictable late spring and early summer, when one minute you need a salad, the next something altogether more hearty.As most of us are limited shopping-wise at the moment, most of the recipes have no more than a handful of ingredients and almost all of them contain one or two store-cupboard stalwarts. Sadly, I have had to leave out my favourite baking recipes, as I suspect most of us are still finding it tricky to get our hands on enough flour. But there is plenty here with which to celebrate, from pea fritters to roast tomatoes with sweet potato mash, a chickpea dip with roast peppers plus a buttermilk panna cotta with sesame brittle.Use whatever noodles you have around for this crisp, light salad. I have suggested brown rice noodles but only because that is what I had in the house. The dressing is at its most refreshing when sharp, sweet and hot, but tweak it to your liking, adding more palm sugar or lime juice as you wish.For the dressinglimes juice of 2light soy sauce 2 tsppalm sugar 2 tspsmall hot red or green chilli 1garlic 2 small young clovesRinse the mung beans under icy-cold running water and drain. Scrub the carrot, slice thinly lengthways, then into matchstick-size strips. Pour boiling water over the noodles and leave to soak for 10 minutes until swollen and tender. (Check the cooking instructions on the packet of the noodles you are using.)Lightly peel the cucumber, then slice in half from stalk to tip, scrape out the seeds and core with a teaspoon and discard them. Cut the cucumber into pencil-thick slices. Remove the leaves from the coriander, leave any small ones whole, and roughly chop the larger ones. Do the same with the mint leaves. Shred the pak choi.Toss the mung beans, carrot, cucumber, pak choi and herbs together. Drain the noodles and toss with the vegetables and herbs.Make the dressing: mix together the juice of the limes, the light soy and sugar. Finely chop the red chilli and add to the dressing. Peel, smash, then finely chop the garlic. Toss the dressing, vegetables, herbs and noodles together. Finally, coarsely chop the peanuts and scatter over the salad.I use shoulder for its flavour and the crispness of its fat. It is often cheaper than the leg. I am the first to admit a shoulder is less straightforward to carve than the other cuts of lamb, and I usually resort to hacking off large juicy pieces of meat, rather than the neat slices you get from a leg. But do use a leg if you prefer.Serves 4-5shoulder of lamb 2kgolive oilanchovy fillets 8rosemary sprigs 8 smallthyme sprigs 8-10For the vegetablesmixed greens 250g (purple sprouting broccoli, young beetroot leaves, red chard etc)shelled peas 250gvegetable stock or water 200mlSet the oven at 180C fangas mark 6. Place the lamb in a roasting tin and rub the meat all over with olive oil and season lightly with sea salt. Pierce the meat in 16 or so places with the point of a knife, cutting 3cm or 4cm down into the flesh.Stuff eight anchovies into half the holes, rosemary tufts in the others. Scatter with the thyme, tucking a few sprigs underneath the meat.Roast the lamb for 1 hour and 30 minutes, until the fat has turned translucent and pale honey-coloured, and the meat is light rose-pink. Remove the roasting tin from the oven, lift out the meat and place somewhere warm, covering lightly with foil. Leave to rest for 15 minutes.Trim the sprouting broccoli and beetroot and chard stems, removing the leaves and setting them aside. Pour any excess oil from the tin, leaving the roasting juices in place. Place the tin over a low to moderate heat, then pour in the stock or water and bring to the boil. When the liquid starts to bubble, stir with a wooden spoon or spatula to dislodge the roasted meat juices and herbs, then add the peas, sprouting broccoli, and chard and beetroot stems. Leave the vegetables to steam in the roasting juices for three or four minutes, turning them from time to time.Add the leaves from the chard and beetroot to the pan, turn them once or twice in the hot liquid until they have wilted, then lift the vegetables out and into a warm serving dish. Turn the heat up under the roasting tin and reduce the liquid to a thin, deeply flavoured dressing. Carve the lamb on to a warm serving dish or directly on to plates, then serve with the vegetables and roasting juices.A hummus of sorts. (I am uncomfortable with calling anything by that name that contains anything other than chickpeas, garlic, lemon and oil.) I do think it is worth skinning the chickpeas (I know, I know) but once you have done so, you may never look back. You can do it painstakingly, pea by pea or simply rub them together in your palms, a handful at a time. Either way will result in a smoother mash.

Slice the peppers in half lengthways, remove the seeds then place the halved fruit in a roasting tin. Trickle a little olive oil over the peppers, just enough to wet them, then set the unpeeled garlic cloves among them. Bake for 40 minutes or until the peppers are soft and the skin somewhat blackened. Remove from the oven, then peel away their outer skins. Reserve any juices in the roasting tin.Open the tins of chickpeas, drain and rinse them. Pop the chickpeas from their skins if you wish, then tip the peas into a saucepan, add the thyme and bay leaves and cover with water. Bring to the boil, lower the heat then simmer for 15 minutes. Drain the chickpeas, reserve a handful for later, then tip the rest into the bowl of a food processor with the roasted, skinned peppers. Pull the thyme leaves from their stalks and add them to the peppers, discarding the stalks and the bay leaves. Pop the roasted garlic from its skin and add to the bowl.Process the peppers, garlic and chickpeas to a smooth cream. Season generously with salt and black pepper. Scoop the paste out into a serving dish, making a hollow in the centre with the back of a spoon.Heat the reserved chickpeas in a little olive oil in a frying pan and cook for a few minutes till they start to turn gold. Pour a little olive oil over the paste, letting it trickle into the hollow, scatter the warm chickpeas over the surface, then dust lightly with the paprika.I find the best breadcrumbs for coating fritters are the Japanese panko crumbs, available at many supermarkets.

Drain on kitchen paper, add to the peas and process briefly, transfer to a bowl, then chill thoroughly for a couple of hours.Fold the egg yolks and 6 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs into the pea mixture. Pour the beaten egg into a shallow dish, and spread the remaining breadcrumbs on a plate. Shape the pea mixture into 6 short, fat barrel-shaped croquettes. Roll each croquette in the beaten egg and then in the crumbs, then chill for 20 minutes.In the same pan in which you cooked the bacon, warm the remaining butter and the oil, then fry the croquettes, over a moderate heat, gently rolling them over now and again to colour evenly. Drain, briefly, on kitchen paper and serve.As the tomatoes roast, their juices will leak into the olive oil, forming a sweet-sharp base to which is added the mustard seeds and turmeric. A handful of curry leaves, tossed in with mustard seeds, wouldn’t go amiss. Let the leaves warm for a minute or two in the hot oil with the mustard seeds, just long enough to lightly infuse the dressing with their earthy warmth.Serves 3-4sweet potatoes 850gcherry tomatoes on the vine 500golive oil 8 tbsponions 2 mediumgarlic 2 medium clovesturmeric 2 level tspyellow mustard seeds 3 tspSet the oven at 200C fangas mark 7. Peel the sweet potatoes, then cut them in half lengthways, then into thick chunks, as you might for boiling. Place the sweet potatoes in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water, then cover them with a tight lid and let them steam to tenderness – a matter of 20 minutes or so. Test them every 5 minutes with a skewer.Put the tomatoes in a shallow baking dish, tossing them with half of the olive oil and grinding over just a little salt. Roast the tomatoes for about 20 minutes until their skins have blackened. While the sweet potatoes steam and the tomatoes roast, peel and thinly slice the onions, and cook them in the remaining olive oil in a shallow pan until they are soft and golden. Peel and thinly slice the garlic and stir it into the softening onions. When the onions and garlic are ready, scoop them out into a small bowl.Drain the juices from the tomatoes into the pan in which you cooked the onions and place over a moderate heat, then stir in the turmeric, letting it sizzle for a moment, then add the mustard seeds and a little black pepper. As soon as the mustard seeds start to pop, remove from the heat. Mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher then stir in the turmeric, mustard seeds and cooking juices.Spoon the spiced sweet potato mash on to plates, add the cooked onions and garlic and the roast tomatoes.Makes 16, enough for 4 peoplepotatoes 500g, floury and white fleshedhaddock or cod fillet 500gmilk 400gwater 200mlparsley stalks 6bay leaves 3black peppercorns 8dill fronds 20gbreadcrumbs 100g, fine and fresheggs 2olive or groundnut oil a little to cookFor the parsley saucebutter 40gplain flour 40gparsley 40gdouble cream 150mlPeel the potatoes and cut them into large pieces, lower them into a deep pan of boiling water and let them cook for 20-25 minutes. They are done when they are tender enough to pierce effortlessly with a skewer. Drain the potatoes and leave for 5 minutes.Put the fish into a pan, pour in the milk and water and add the parsley, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring the liquid to the boil, lower the heat and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, or until the fish is lightly cooked. You should be able to pull the flakes apart with relative ease. Set the fish aside.Mash the potato. It should be smooth but not gluey. Finely chop the dill and add to the potato. Remove the fish from the milk, break into large flakes then combine lightly with the potato. Take care not to crush the fish.Roll the fish and potato mixture into 16 balls of approximately equal size, place on a tray and refrigerate for half an hour.Scatter the breadcrumbs on a plate. Break the eggs into a small mixing bowl and beat lightly. Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan, add the flour and stir together, cooking lightly over a moderate heat for 4 or 5 minutes, stirring almost constantly. Pour in the reserved milk from cooking the fish, discarding the aromatics as you go. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat, stirring until you have a smooth sauce. Chop the leaves from the parsley. Pour in the cream, add the parsley and correct the seasoning. Cover to stop a skin forming and set aside.Remove the fishcakes from the fridge and drop them, one at time, first into the beaten egg and then the breadcrumbs. Place the crumbed balls on a tray. Warm a shallow layer of oil in a nonstick frying pan, add the cakes without crowding the pan and let them colour evenly, moving them around the pan as necessary. Remove, drain briefly on kitchen paper and serve with the parsley sauce.Serves 4onions 3 mediumolive oil 6 tbsp, plus extra for frying the hakechorizo 300gthyme 6 bushy sprigstomatoes 750g smalljudion or butter beans 425g, bottled or tinnedhake 1.2kg, cut into 4 steaksmanzanilla or similar medium-dry sherry 150mlPeel the onions, cut them in half and roughly chop them.

Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 7.Slice the chorizo into pieces the length of a wine cork, add them to the onions together with the whole sprigs of thyme and let the sausage colour lightly. Slice the tomatoes in half, then stir them through the onions together with the drained and rinsed beans.In a separate, shallow, nonstick pan, warm the extra oil and, when it is hot, lower in a couple of the fish steaks. Let them colour lightly on the underside without cooking them right through, then turn and do the same on the other side. As each piece of fish becomes ready, transfer to the roasting tin, tucking them among the tomatoes and onions. Repeat with the remaining two pieces of fish. Once they are done, pour off any oil from the frying pan, return to the heat, and pour in the manzanilla, letting it bubble as you scrape at the sticky bits with a wooden spatula. Tip over the fish.Place in the preheated oven and bake for 35 minutes until the fish is done. Place the fish, onions, beans and tomatoes on deep, warm plates, spooning over the juices as you go.The roasting juices form part of the dressing, but you could easily use cold chicken left from a Sunday roast, adding a little more dressing as necessary. If you are not eating this immediately, I would be tempted to add the coriander at the last minute.Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 7. Put the thighs into a roasting tin, rub them generously with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and roast for 45 minutes or until the skin is crisp and the thigh juices run clear when pierced with a skewer.Peel the ginger and slice into matchsticks. Halve the chillies lengthways, de-seed if you wish, then slice finely. Peel and finely slice the garlic.Take the chicken from the oven, remove from the tin, then leave to rest for 10 minutes before tearing the flesh from the bones in large pieces and dropping them into a mixing bowl. Place the cooking juices in the tin over a moderate heat, add the ginger and garlic and let them colour to a warm, nutty brown. Add the sliced chilli for the last minute or so, then remove all from the heat.Stir the sesame oil into the ginger and chilli dressing, the Thai fish sauce and the rice wine vinegar. Squeeze the limes, stir the juice into the dressing then check the seasoning.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the sesame seeds until golden then add them to the dressing. Roughly tear the mint and coriander leaves and mix them with the chicken, then carefully fold together the chicken and the ginger dressing.The thinnest of tarts. It is worth rolling the pastry as finely as you can. Try placing the pastry on the baking sheet before adding the bananas. It makes life much easier than transferring them fully laden.For the cardamom creamgreen cardamom pods 10double cream 250mlicing sugar 1 tbspvanilla extractSet the oven at 220C fangas mark 9. Place a baking sheet in the oven to heat up.Melt the butter in a small pan, remove from the heat and set aside. Roll out the pastry very thinly, then cut out 4 discs about 12cm in diameter. Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.Peel the bananas and slice thinly, then place in a single, slightly overlapping layer on each disc. Brush the bananas and the rims of the pastry with the butter then dust generously with the icing sugar.Place the baking sheet on the heated sheet in the oven and bake for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven then trickle the maple syrup over the bananas and return to the oven for 5 minutes until the pastry is deep golden brown and the fruit is sticky and glistening.Meanwhile, make the cream. Crack open the cardamom pods and extract the dark seeds, then crush to a powder using a spice mill or pestle and mortar. You need 2 tsp of the ground spice. Pour the cream into a cold mixing bowl and add the icing sugar, ground cardamom and a couple of drops of vanilla extract. Beat till thick, stopping once the cream will hold its shape on the whisk.Serve the tarts hot from the oven, with the cardamom cream.For the sesame brittlesesame seeds 50gcaster sugar 80gYou will need 4 small ramekins or cups.To make the sesame brittle, have ready a nonstick baking sheet. Warm a shallow pan over a moderate heat, sprinkle the sesame seeds over the surface of the pan in a single layer. Watch carefully, shaking the pan from time to time, until the seeds are pale gold. Scatter the sugar over the seeds and leave to melt. As the sugar melts and turns gold, tip the pan left and right so the sugar melts evenly. Very gently, stir any bits that are browning into the middle of the pan. As soon as the sugar is honey-coloured, tip on to the baking sheet, smoothing into a thin pool, then leave to set. Remove from the sheet by prising a palette knife underneath.To make the panna cotta, put the gelatine leaves in a small bowl of cold water to soften.Pour the cream into a small, nonstick saucepan, add the sugar then bring almost to the boil. Remove from the heat, gently squeeze the water from the softened gelatine, add to the cream and let the gelatine dissolve. Pour the buttermilk into the cream and gelatine, stir gently then pour through a fine sieve over a jug.Pour the panna cotta mixture into the 4 small moulds, place in the fridge and leave to set for four hours.Crush the praline coarsely using a pestle and mortar or the back of a wooden spoon. Melt the chocolate in a small bowl over simmering water.To serve, unmould the panna cotta. An easy way to do this is to dip the dishes into hot water, run a palette knife around the edge to loosen them, then turn upside down on to a little dish. A firm shake should dislodge the panna cotta from its home.Spoon the chocolate over the panna cotta, then crumble over the crushed sesame praline.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bebe9fec1dcad84552ff8c56f63d2cd7fa81e682/0_198_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4defde956b09fc6d20331b8d4241302c","title":"celtic scottish title triumph not diminished by cold climax","story":"They were the best team in Scotland during 2019-20 – by any reasonable barometer, their advantage over Rangers would have been pressed homeIt has seemed impossible to decouple bitterness relating to Celtic’s title win from the reality of it being a perfectly valid outcome. Perhaps that was a useful byproduct for some of those immersed in the almighty row that recently engulfed the Scottish scene.Celtic were the finest team in Scotland in 2019-20. The abbreviated season is surely a frustration for Neil Lennon and his players as outsiders look to diminish a ninth championship in succession. The sniping does not matter and how Celtic choose to celebrate is entirely up to them. There are of course deeper problems to ponder but a trophy retained by Monday morning Zoom call denies fans a moment in time. They will compensate for that as best they can.The lead over Rangers – 13 points with eight games to play – would have been pressed home and in Odsonne Édouard, Celtic had the best player for good measure. Whereas clubs understandably object to being relegated when a season finishes short of a natural conclusion, the awarding of prizes when the situation was a fait accompli should be far less contentious. “Should” being the operative word.Celtic have cause to rue extenuating circumstances. Nine is Scotland’s magic number, matching the record for successive league titles. This run has the backdrop of Rangers being out of the top flight for four seasons and football’s coronavirus-triggered suspension.Lennon and Celtic fans have no reason to care. When the objective is to be the leading side in Scotland, weakness of opposition is not their problem. The target has been met comfortably. Celtic drew two matches and lost two while returning a goal difference of 70. Celtic averaged 2.67 points – and 2.97 goals – per league fixture.Celtic deserve particular credit for a stirring response to defeat in the Old Firm match on 29 December. Rangers sat two points behind their oldest foes with a game in hand. Giddy analysis – not from Steven Gerrard, it must be noted – suggested a title battle worthy of the name was imminent but Celtic returned from their subsequent mid-season break in inspired form while Rangers wilted.Gerrard has succeeded in separating Rangers from the rest as the Premiership’s second force but there remains no compelling case to argue Celtic’s stranglehold will be loosened anytime soon. It would take a seismic shift for them to be denied a perfect 10.A key Celtic strength lies in their sellable assets. Moussa Dembélé and Kieran Tierney earned the club almost £45m without a domestic threat emerging. Édouard has admirers in England and abroad, Callum McGregor and Ryan Christie likewise. The development of Kristoffer Ajer, Christopher Jullien, Jeremie Frimpong and Mikey Johnston could result in more football and balance sheet success.It remains a troublesome balancing act to assemble a squad capable of making European inroads when Ross County, Hamilton and St Johnstone are the staple diet but Celtic have managed their resources smartly.There is symmetry to Lennon, who presided over the first of the nine titles, being back at the helm. The 48-year-old, by widespread acknowledgment more calm than during his first Celtic tenure, will take great pride in matching the record.He has done it from a complicated standpoint. There were murmurs of discontent when Lennon succeeded Brendan Rodgers, who made fundamental changes to Celtic. There have been bumps in the road – a comprehensive Europa League defeat by Copenhagen, mainly – but Lennon has returned to the frontline with a minimum of fuss and arguably enhanced many elements of the team’s performance.Historical comparisons are an Old Firm staple. Nonetheless, it feels futile to judge this Celtic against the one who cantered to nine titles from 1966. A year later, they were champions of Europe during a spell when Scottish clubs could go toe to toe with the best. Societal and economic changes are such that football – the game and business – is unrecognisable from that period. Many nations – including new ones – have left Scotland behind.Even Rangers’ version of nine in a row, achieved from 1989, is not a valid parallel given they could compete financially against European giants. If those from Glasgow’s blue half seek to demean their rivals’ success on the basis of weakness elsewhere, the financial implosion at Celtic in the early 1990s is a counterpoint.It would be naive to disregard the modest scale of the challenge facing Celtic domestically. Only those with vested interests can suggest the championship monopoly or duopoly that has existed since Aberdeen were kings in 1985 is healthy. However, Celtic’s place on top of the mountain is beyond question. It would be churlish to allow rancour to overshadow their achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b2871395b4c4f8da6290b5b26cd0fbbaf13cc4e/0_387_2576_1545/master/2576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9f691df07316deb582d3316b804358","title":"how we met i had this surge of adrenaline i just had to get to know her","story":"Andrew and Tanja Bone, 61 and 55, met in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war. They live in Scotland with their two rescue dogsAndrew Bone was working as a truck driver for the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1993, distributing food and medicine to war-torn areas of Bosnia. At the end of the year, he flew to Sarajevo to cover for another staff member. “It was a desperate situation to fly into,” he says. “I was whisked straight up to the organisation’s headquarters in a bullet-proof Land Rover.” That’s where he spotted Tanja Todorovic for the first time. “I had this surge of adrenaline. I just felt that I had to get to know her. It sounds like a silly fairytale but it’s true.”At the time, Tanja was working as a senior field officer for the charity. Andrew got the chance to speak to her properly when they were sent to deliver aid to a home for people with learning disabilities. “Andy was so kind to the people who lived there,” says Tanja. “He was handsome too. All this long, blonde, curly hair. It’s all gone now, of course,” she laughs.Shortly afterwards, Tanja had to go to Pale for a work mission and asked Andrew to be her driver. “The road back was shelled while we were there,” he says. “We ended up having to spend the night in Pale. We had drinks together and that’s the night that we started our relationship.”A couple of weeks later, Andrew’s cover came to an end and he was sent back to Zagreb. “I was distraught. I went to the radio room and begged the operators to let me talk to her.” They told him it was impossible. “Eventually though they said they were nipping out for coffee and I was able to get hold of Tanja to tell her I loved her.”Shortly afterwards, Tanja travelled to Zagreb to meet Andrew. “I had a Red Cross passport, which meant I was able to travel out of the war zone,” she explains. They discussed the future of their relationship and whether Tanja should return to Sarajevo. They knew they wanted to be together and had big decisions to make.The situation was complicated by the fact that they were both married at the time. “My marriage wasn’t working out and Tanja was separated but it was really hard,” says Andrew. “Back then, Britain was sympathetic to refugees coming from Bosnia, so we decided it would be best to come here and be together, away from the war.”Tanja applied for asylum and the pair were able to marry at the end of 1994, once their orces were finalised. “I then got indefinite leave to remain and in 1999 I got my British citizenship,” she says.Over the next 10 years, they moved around the UK, living in Norfolk, London, Leicester and Scotland. Andrew continued to work as a truck driver, while Tanja took on various roles including working for the Refugee Council and launching an organic fruit and vegetable shop in Leicester.In 2004, she went back to university to train as a nurse and the couple moved to London. However, they soon realised they weren’t ready to stop exploring. “From 2009 to 2019, we travelled around the UK by boat, moving from place to place,” says Tanja. They worked when they needed to and enjoyed their nomadic lifestyle.When Andrew became ill with cancer 18 months ago, they moved to a permanent base in Dumbarton, Scotland. “I feel really lucky to have had such incredible care at the hands of the NHS. I had some surgery just before lockdown and they now think I am cancer-free,” he says. Tanja is still working as a nurse, and the pair have been enjoying daily walks together. “We love the countryside here,” says Tanja. “When it’s safe, we will go back to hiking in the Highlands.”It’s been 26 years since they met, but Andrew says he is more in love than ever. “She is my best friend and my everything. Nothing has changed for me since the moment we met.” Tanja feels the same. “Meeting each other has been truly life-changing. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened for either of us.”Want to share your story?

Thrown almost overnight into a virtual classroom, they are using video games and creating group chats or escape rooms for pupils. The internet gives teachers access to subject experts from around the world who can deliver masterclasses via video link to an entire year group.The health emergency is creating new opportunities, which they say will transform the way they teach forever.Lee Small is head of computer science at Ribblesdale high school, in Clitheroe, Lancashire. He says: “We have had to think differently and dynamically. I think we will go on to put some of these different technologies to use in the classroom to support students’ learning alongside traditional teaching methods.”Ribblesdale has Microsoft Training Academy status, which means it is at the forefront of using cutting-edge technology in its teaching. It is also a Demonstrator school, one of 20 schools and colleges identified by the DfE and delivery partners that have demonstrated excellence in their use of technology to support teaching and learning, and have the capacity to help others.Teachers realised immediately that if remote learning was to work they would have to design shorter lessons that were quick to engage pupils, with speedy outcomes, otherwise students risked becoming passive observers.The key was to use platforms that pupils were familiar with. At Ribblesdale that meant tapping into the video game Minecraft. “It’s an amazingly popular game and is an incredibly powerful teaching tool,” says Small. It has been invaluable in English lessons to support children who struggle to express themselves in the written word: “They’ve been able to design their story in the Minecraft world and then write about it when they see their idea on the screen.”In Warrington, Cheshire, teachers at the King’s leadership academy learned how to use the principles and theory of video games, with graded challenges and teamwork, to design more engaging remote lessons: “We’ve had to make the lessons more exciting and had to make sure that the children find a purpose in what they are doing,” says principal Shane Ierston.In Berkshire, maths teacher Lewis Hart, of University Technical College (UTC) Reading, says lockdown has made him think more creatively about how he teaches and collaborates: “I can’t rely on a combination of verbal and written. I’ve had to come out of my comfort zone.”Hart turned to YouTube for inspiration: “One of my favourites is the 3Blue1Brown channel, devoted to high school maths but it looks at it in a different way, at the deeper underlying fundamentals, which has been a really good way of getting students to look at familiar topics in an unfamiliar way.”UTC Reading is part of the national network that is using technology to enhance teaching in the traditional and virtual classrooms. The Surface laptop, for example, has dual far-field studio mics and an HD camera which ensure that teachers can be heard and seen clearly when in contact with students or colleagues.The school has used Microsoft Teams so teachers can continue their teacher training during lockdown. It has also created a video bank of lessons so students who may have missed classes can catch up in their own time, and there is potential to work remotely with school refusers in future. Siobhan Tyson, UTC’s director of science with additional responsibility for professional development, says the technology is transformative: “It is giving us flexibility and it’s definitely going to have an impact on future teaching.”Teachers admit it can be a constant battle to keep their tech skills ahead of their pupils’, or what their pupils expect. Ribblesdale has 10 Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts (MIEE) – staff skilled in delivering the Microsoft schools programme who share their expertise with colleagues. But Small points out: “Teachers don’t have to be experts in a piece of software in order to use it, they just need to be able to use it to give a platform to students to be creative and foster their independence.”Collaboration with peers has been crucial during lockdown as teachers share remote teaching ideas, so the Surface can be useful as it is designed to encourage closer working and allows teachers to easily share resources. English teacher and vice-principal at King’s, Katie Sharp, says working collaboratively has, for her, been essential during lockdown. “I’m a person who likes working with people, so this has been quite a culture shock for me. But we’ve been able to share links to each other’s lessons, which means we can give feedback if I see something I like, such as a quiz, I can ask how they do that.”This new way of working has also prompted teachers to think about how digital technology has a role in marking and assessment, says Small: “We’ve been looking at how we can use AI to support students in their grades, for example we have an app on Teams where we can tell how long students have engaged with the content.”But remote learning only works if pupils have access to a device and reliable broadband. Schools have sometimes used the pupil premium to cover device costs and given pupils dongles to tap into phone technology if broadband is poor.Teresa Skeggs is headteacher of Peartree Spring primary, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where each year-group has access to devices of various kinds. It uses Microsoft 365 to deliver its whole-school email, while its server and some of its laptops “consistently” rely on Windows 10. She says: “What we are delivering now is a more in-depth version of what we have always done – we’ve always had blended learning.”Five tips for online teaching:1. Think differently about how you teach. Teaching remotely is more than just going online. Technology used creatively can be transformative.2. Keep your talking to a minimum – bite-size chunks of around five minutes. The voice is important but students do not need to see you to hear you. Captioning all videos means they are accessible to everyone.3. Consider dropping your headshot into the corner of the screen if you feel students still need to see you when talking. Use pictures with captions as well as slides to illustrate as you talk. Keep things simple.4. Lessons must be engaging and inclusive, gain student interest quickly and have quick outcomes. Use programs and platforms that are familiar to pupils to create a fun learning experience of quizzes and games.5. Create small groups on tools such as Teams to encourage group discussion. Encourage students to ask questions through a chat panel.Interested in finding out more about how to create engaging online learning environments?

Headteachers explain how it’s doneWhen it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”Today’s tech makes it much simpler to make those tweaks – and schools which had been exploring its possibilities before the lockdown have already considered many of the big questions around online safety. Choosing devices that can be rolled out with ease is a key consideration in reducing IT complexity. At University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, pupils had already received training on professional behaviour both face-to-face and online. “They know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the consequences of doing something that is outside what we would consider professional,” says principal Jon Nicholls. “And they get it. We have close ties with industry, and our students understand professional boundaries.”However, a secure platform is also crucial. UTC Reading’s Microsoft Teams package has considerable functionality for keeping both students and staff safe online. All student data is held securely. Only invited students can attend classes – nobody else can join. Teachers can invite students into small groups for additional support work without other students being aware. Another teacher or learning support staff member is always online to actively monitor student chat. And lessons are recorded and stored – including any chat – so they can be checked if any concerns are raised by staff or students.Choosing the correct platform can also help to solve the problem of device access. There has been an explosion of cloud-based learning platforms and tools in the education sector that are designed to be used solely in a web browser, says Brendan Tapping, chief executive officer at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that serves south Tyneside, Sunderland and east Durham.“This has overcome many of the hurdles that students would have faced when trying to complete work from home. The cloud-based learning platforms allow students to complete their homework anytime, anywhere from almost any device, including their own mobile phones,” he says.These platforms are also key to allowing staff to easily communicate, collaborate and share learning resources, tips and strategies, helping to replicate face-to-face staffroom discussions and prevent teachers themselves from feeling isolated.But although being online has its own risks, the biggest risk for a child is living in an environment where threats exist – and lockdown could mean more risk for them. How can schools keep track of them in an online-only environment? Again, they’re using established best practice combined with tech and the art of good communication.At Ribblesdale, the school’s online learning platform, Teams, logs everything – including how often a child logs on to the platform, which the school can then monitor. “If a child is not accessing any work, that’s the first potential warning that something is wrong,” says Cox. “But we won’t use technology if it’s not the most applicable way of safeguarding. We might simply decide to phone up a child if that’s the right thing to do.”Regular communication has also been paramount at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust. “All pupils and parents receive regular wellbeing phone calls from a familiar member of staff, with our most vulnerable pupils and parents or carers being spoken to on a daily basis,” says Tapping. “It’s key to ensuring our families feel fully supported and we can ensure we keep our community as safe as possible in their virtual learning world.”And as school leaders begin to contemplate what school life might look like in the future, Redhead is optimistic that the key to staying safe online is having that strong safeguarding culture embedded in the first place – and that hasn’t stopped in lockdown. “I’ve got 200-plus children accessing Teams, and nobody’s misbehaving!” she says. “Nobody’s using it inappropriately, and that’s not because I’m telling them not to do it – that’s around the culture in the school. We shouldn’t be afraid of tech. It’s where our children’s futures are going to be.”Five tips for online security1. Ensure staff are trained in online safety and recognise the security risk posed by phishing emails.2. Choose a cloud-based, secure online learning platform which allows recording of lessons and chats.3. Keep lines of communication with pupils and other agencies open – if necessary, just make a phone call.4. Encourage parents and pupils to use school devices which are already locked down, and loan them out if necessary.5.

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed – it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family’s kitchen table.Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students’ creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children’s learning journey.Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter’s school, and considers the school’s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. “Daisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable – it’s working fantastically,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.”Distance learning isn’t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams – used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions – is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it’s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child’s online education doesn’t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: “Even Maia’s school isn’t trying to replicate it – she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.“I think that’s a really good model – don’t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.”Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts – features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.For home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O’Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick’s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. “A lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,” he says. “We spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.”Parents who want to support their child’s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. “I certainly don’t know everything and my kids know that,” laughs Dalpra. “You’re not an encyclopaedia we look things up together and they’re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.”With so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices – meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.“Microsoft apps don’t necessarily require children to work within them,” says O’Halloran. “A screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.”Equipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way – at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity – is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.For some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child’s needs. “One of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of inidual learners,” she says.An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of inidual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools – such as Immersive Reader – are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text – students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.It’s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: “Children develop if they’re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child’s education.”Five tips to support online education1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn’t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children’s concentration.2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help – not all children are used to doing so.4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.5. Remember that you’re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you’re still learning too, and approach it together.Interested in finding out more about how to support your child’s online learning experience?

Online teaching has revolutionised the way students are learning today and the current crisis has accelerated the transition to online learning even more.Approximately 1.37 billion students are now learning from home as a result of the lockdown, including more than 2.38 million students studying at UK higher education institutions, and almost 60.2 million teachers are no longer teaching from the classroom.Oliver Fisher, co-founder of Springpod, says that most students have adapted to the rapid change of moving everything online well. “Teachers have always provided other activities alongside the core curriculum but the crisis has forced them to explore the huge amount of resources available online,” he says.Matt Jenner, head of learning at the FutureLearn online platform says that the lockdown has turned remote learning from optional to mandatory. “More schools, colleges and universities are now realising that learning online can offer immense flexibility you’re not tied to location, topics or a timetable,” he notes.Charlie Kilner, a sixth-form student at Millfield school in Somerset, says he has actually found the transition to moving everything online very smooth. “We’re lucky to use devices regularly already so the real transition was just getting used to seeing my teacher over Microsoft Teams.”Kilner, who recently set up a podcast with his media studies teacher, Aimee Coelho, for people to record their stories of life in lockdown, believes the current crisis has fuelled creativity. “Our podcast was made possible through Teams and other online chat forums. We’ve been overwhelmed with the number of submissions from across the globe, from Geneva, Chile and Palau,” he says. “I think lots of great educational content can be made at times like this.”Technology has certainly come a long way in the past decade and can be adapted to suit most subjects, including art. School devices, such as Microsoft Surface, can be used with a Surface Pen to write and sketch. Maia Dalpra, a GCSE student at University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, says the online lessons for her GCSE classes are typically held in real time with one teacher answering questions as they come up on the online chat function. This makes her feel just as involved and more like an Open University student than a GCSE one. “I like the fact that I have more independence and that they’re trusting us to organise our time.” The lessons are also recorded so if any student misses one, they can watch it later.Dalpra has gone from having a full school day to three 45-minute lessons each morning online, but feels that this has actually given her an opportunity to develop stronger organisation skills. “I think having more free time is helping me prepare for university. I have the afternoon to study, write essays and reports, and research stuff. If anything, I’m more productive than I was before,” she says.Chloe Godsell, a partnership manager and university admissions expert at Crimson Education, says trust has become more important than ever in the changing relationship between the teacher and student. “Trust between teachers and students plays a much bigger role in online learning than with traditional methods,” she notes. “Teachers are more reliant on students to complete assignments, but similarly, students are reliant on the teachers to deliver the lessons to a different standard.”Dame Kathy August, a former headteacher, director of education and Department for Education senior adviser, says that a teacher’s personality is also hugely important. “Personalities play a big part in the transmission of ideas and values, and I think it can sometimes be harder to transmit that through an online model.”August also believes boys might struggle slightly more than girls with online learning. “As a sweeping generalisation, based on my own teaching experience, I’d say boys might find time management and organisation more difficult. They might be better at getting to grips with the technology but be a little more chaotic.”Dr Lynne Livesey, a deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Central Lancashire, says interactive games can help engage disinterested learners. “Using games in education is just another way to learn, but it can be just as effective. The skill rests with teachers knowing when to use the right tools and then ensuring they’re accessible to everyone.”Daisy Brown, a year-eight student at a high school that gives all students the chance to buy or rent a laptop from year 7 onwards, says one of the things she’s enjoying most about online learning is the educational games. “The teachers use online quizzes and other interactive tech games for design and technology,” she says. “Our touchscreen devices make it easy to answer questions right away and mean the teachers can reply to us straight away too.”There are some things, however, that simply cannot be done during lockdown. Rosie Jacobs, a sixth-form student at Stoke Newington school in London, says: “For my geography A-level I’m supposed to be looking at the area around King’s Cross but that’s not really something I can do at the moment.”That said, being confined to the house doesn’t necessarily stop you learning about the rest of the world, with virtual reality allowing students to journey from the ruins of Greece to the Sahara desert.Jacobs points out that there are some other useful features in online learning, which probably work better for teachers. “One of our teachers mutes us all while she’s carrying out the lesson,” she says. “And that probably makes it more productive for her!”Godsell adds that, ultimately, what began as anxiety-inducing and unfamiliar has become the new normal. “There have been steep learning curves for everyone involved, and many lessons learned along the way. The most important one is that students need to be able to interact and engage with the teacher and each other for real learning to happen,” she says.Five top tips for students:1. Use the online chat function to ask questions as you go. There’s a Raise Hands feature in Teams to signal that you want to speak.2. Try and create a timetable to work from so you have a structure to the day.3. Ask a friend if they will be your study buddy for some collaborative working.4. Remember to take regular breaks throughout the day, and the Do Not Disturb feature in Teams can help with this.5. Use quizzes and interactive games to make things more fun.Interested in finding out more about how to get the most out of online learning, now and in the future?

Barely a day has gone by without him being sent out on to the government frontline. But the effort is clearly beginning to take its toll. In the past few weeks his normal Tiggerish enthusiasm and goodwill to all has given way to something rather more vulnerable. A man who feels himself not just under attack from a country that wonders why the health secretary hasn’t done rather more to protect the nation’s health, but also from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues who have been lining him up as the scapegoat in the inevitable public inquiry.The initial sign that Matt was not coping so well was in his snappiness. His tetchiness with MPs and members of the media whenever his version of events was challenged. Now though it’s looking as if Hancock is moving through the denial and anger stages of grief toward the bargaining and depression stages.There’s still a way to go before he comes to any form of acceptance but now there is a discernible sadness to his public performances. An emotional fragility that can barely be kept at bay. Other people’s anger he can just about deal with. It’s their compassion that will get him in the end. The Dear Matt text in which he is dumped with the words, “It’s not you, it’s me.”For his Commons coronavirus statement, it was all Matt could do to hold it together for an hour. Hardly surprising as he knows better than anyone that much of what he’s saying is pure fantasy. Though the truth might set him free, he’s just not quite ready for the admission of failure. So he began as if the coronavirus was a mild inconvenience, rather than the worst public health crisis for 100 years.We’d passed the peak – please, no one tell him about the probability of a second wave – and by and large everything was totally in control. The government had done brilliantly, hospitals had coped and NHS mental health services were there for anyone who needed them. Provided they were able to wait six months without falling apart completely for a referral to a professional.Care homes had had a protective ring thrown round them from the very start of the pandemic. As a description of the government’s handling of the crisis it could hardly have been more inaccurate. But this wasn’t about the public. It was about throwing a protective ring around Matt’s psyche. This was as close to reality as he could bring himself to get.There were a few new announcements. From now on anosmia – a lack of smell or taste – would be added to a persistent dry cough and high temperature as coronavirus symptoms. And anyone with any of these symptoms could now get a test if they could log on to the NHS website and find a testing station with capacity to see them. Best of all, Matt was able to report that he had beaten his target of recruiting 18,000 tracers – he didn’t know if they were yet trained – and now had 21,000 people on the books. Though given Hancock’s dodgy record on false accounting, it was quite possible that some of the new recruits may have been counted twice.Some politicians believe you need to be cruel to be kind. Labour’s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, takes the opposite view and is kind to be cruel. He’s long since stopped being angry with Hancock over the government’s mishandling of the crisis and now just talks to him like an awkward teenager in whom he’s disappointed. It had been a bit late to include anosmia, hadn’t it? There hadn’t always been a protective ring around care homes, had there? And what was the point in easing lockdown restrictions before there was a comprehensive test and trace system up and running to replace them?Matt was now on the verge of breaking down. His eyes bloodshot as he tried to hold it together. Pleading for one last chance to make the relationship work. There was definitely a protective ring around care homes. Things would change. Get better, he promised. Having already forgotten that his new test and trace operation was supposed to have kicked in two days ago. Just one last chance, he pleaded.“We are ready and preparing,” he said, apparently unaware that the two were mutually exclusive. You’re either ready or you’re preparing. A few Tory backbenchers tried to put a socially-distanced arm around him and reassure him he was doing OK, but most just melted away. Matt left the chamber alone. Hopefully to have a long sob in private. He might just find it cathartic.Fifteen minutes later, Priti Patel made a rare public appearance as she reintroduced her immigration bill. Most of us have long since concluded that the home secretary has been kept hidden because she is fundamentally useless. But now some MPs were wondering if she might not also have had the coronavirus. Because there was a total lack of taste in announcing plans to keep low-paid overseas workers out of the country, when they are doing more than most to keep the NHS, care homes and food deliveries running.Still, Patel did want to pay a small tribute to those doing jobs she considers unskilled. Not least because she has also proved that being home secretary is low-skilled work. So, as a compromise, she proposed that everyone should continue clapping key workers at 8pm on a Thursday. Just to help them on their way to the deportation centre. She’s all heart, Priti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea5f4fc91b5700d1c1335829fd6d1f4a8075803/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6167813437fc487cb12ff13a5453de7","title":"covid 19 are pandemics becoming more common podcast","story":"Ian Sample talks to Prof Kate Jones about whether the current coronavirus pandemic is part of a wider picture of increasing animal-to-human virus transmission.

And they suggest that the vaccine is safe for use in humans.Part of a first-stage trial of 45 people run by the US company Moderna, the results are from a preliminary safety study and do not demonstrate that the treatment will work. But they will be a sign of encouragement for experts and governments desperate for a breakthrough in the battle to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic – widely believed to be impossible without a vaccine.Although both programmes are in the early stages, the findings also appear to put the US research ahead of the UK’s. While the Oxford vaccine was shown in a safety study to protect macaque monkeys against pneumonia, it did not stop infection – which could leave people liable to spread the virus, even if they do not get sick themselves.With the backing of the British government, the Oxford group is partnering with the drug company AstraZeneca to make 30m doses for the UK – if the vaccine works. It is to receive £65.5m to fund its work. Imperial College London, which also has a vaccine under development, has been awarded £18.5m. In the US study, run by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, all eight volunteers made neutralising antibodies which were tested in human cells in the lab and stopped the virus from replicating. The higher the vaccine dose, the more antibodies the volunteer produced.However, as with antibody tests, there will still be questions over whether this response is enough to prevent people from being infected by the virus. This approach does not stimulate another arm of the immune response, from the T-cells. It is also not known whether an antibody response will last.Many different companies and institutions around the world are racing to develop a vaccine in record time, using different approaches. The World Health Organization has a list of 76 contenders. Moderna was the first in the world into clinical trials with an RNA vaccine, which uses a segment of genetic material from the virus itself, called messenger DNA, to provoke the immune system into making antibodies.Imperial College is also developing an RNA vaccine, although its approach is different. Robin Shattock, professor of mucosal infection and immunity, who is leading the Imperial trials, said the Moderna findings were encouraging. “While it will be important to scrutinise the actual data, the reported findings are in line with expectations that vaccine candidates should provide levels of neutralising antibodies that are at least equivalent to convalescent subjects,” he said.“This is a promising start, but efficacy data will be key followed by an ability to scale in a manner that provides global access should this vaccine be successful.”Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, also gave the news a cautious welcome. “Well, it isn’t bad news and there are a number of good points that suggest optimism that this vaccine may work,” he said.Oxford University has published results of safety trials in macaque monkeys. While the vaccine prevented the monkeys from developing pneumonia, it did not block the virus from infecting the animals.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology, University of Nottingham, said that the Oxford results were encouraging in that they prevented serious illness, but that if the vaccine works the same way in humans, it may not prevent the spread of disease.“If this represents infectious virus and a similar thing occurs in humans, then vaccinated people can still be infected, shed large amounts of virus which could potentially spread to others in the community,” he said.“If the most vulnerable people aren’t protected by the vaccine to the same degree, then this will put them at risk. Therefore, vaccine efficacy in vulnerable populations and the potential for virus shedding in vaccinated people needs very careful monitoring.”Moderna has so far only released results for the youngest group of volunteers. It intends to press ahead to the next stage of human trials involving 600 people shortly, with a much bigger trial involving thousands set to begin in July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bde8fa0726459cda7c9ac5747fc2a4749f804070/0_124_3120_1873/master/3120.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=baba4b54256af3862212492ece6a0c49","title":"kevin mayer tiktok ceo disney plus","story":"Walt Disney Co’s top streaming executive, Kevin Mayer, will leave the entertainment and theme parks giant to become the chief executive officer of TikTok, the popular video app owned by China’s ByteDance, the companies said on Monday.Mayer led the successful launch of the Disney+ streaming service in November but in February was passed over as Disney’s new chief executive.Mayer’s appointment will be effective 1 June, when he will also become chief operating officer of ByteDance, the Chinese company said.TikTok, which allows users to create short videos with special effects, has become wildly popular with US teenagers doing viral challenges that pair dances with music clips from the app’s library. TikTok has hinted at ambitions to build a music streaming business, announcing in January that it was partnering with the UK-based music rights agency Merlin to expand its musical selections.ByteDance’s Chinese ownership, however, has sparked concerns in Washington about TikTok’s handling of personal data. The company uses sophisticated artificial intelligence to make video recommendations based on users’ behavior on the app.In November, the US government launched a national security review of ByteDance’s $1bn acquisition of social media app Musical.ly, which became TikTok under ByteDance’s leadership. Two senators have introduced a bill to ban federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones.To appease those concerns, ByteDance has stepped up efforts to separate TikTok from much of its Chinese businesses and has made several high-profile executive hires in recent months. It appointed Erich Andersen, the former Microsoft intellectual property chief, as global general counsel in January, after hiring Vanessa Pappas, a veteran YouTube executive, to run its US operations last year.Speculation over Mayer’s future began swirling in February after Disney named Robert Chapek as chief executive officer. Mayer was seen as a dealmaker who had only recently been put in charge of a large profit-and-loss ision. His relative lack of operating experience was a main reason he did not get the top job, the former executive said.A ByteDance spokesman said the company had “no reservations” about Mayer’s operational experience. “Any company in our sector would be delighted have him onboard.”Chapek praised Mayer in a statement on Monday, saying he “has done a masterful job of overseeing and growing our portfolio of streaming services, while bringing together the creative and technological assets required to launch the hugely successful Disney+ globally”.Under Mayer’s leadership, Disney+ signed up more than 50 million subscribers in five months.Disney named Rebecca Campbell, a 23-year company veteran, to replace Mayer as head of the direct-to-consumer and international ision, which includes the streaming media units Disney is counting on to drive future growth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c440a8654f3ac628ca55523430d8106a6887adcd/420_334_4873_2925/master/4873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbca512eb29fcdd06b09c6e318f43d64","title":"surface go 2 review microsofts smaller cheaper windows 10 tablet","story":"New model squeezes bigger screen in same body, for an excellent, affordable ultraportable PC The Surface Go 2 is Microsoft’s second iteration of its low-cost, smaller tablet computer and continues to prove that cheap Windows PCs don’t have to be terrible.The Surface Go 2 starts at £399, but for that you don’t get the £100 Type Cover keyboard, which is a must-have. That places the Surface Go 2 in the low-end PC bracket and makes it Microsoft’s cheapest current PC, the Surface Pro 7, by £300.Tested here is the £529 Intel Pentium Gold 4425Y version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of faster SSD storage with the £125 Alcantara Type Cover.Not a lot has changed since the original. The Surface Go 2 has a slightly larger 10.5in screen, which helps boost the real estate you have on there. Other than an extra 22g in weight, the magnesium body of the machine is identical to the original Surface Go, at 8.3mm thick, 245mm long and 175mm tall. It weighs in at 544g. By any metric the Surface Go 2 is a tiny portable PC, that’s easy to carry or fit in a bag, much like Apple’s similarly priced and sized iPad Air.The 10.5in LCD touchscreen is great. Crisp, bright, good looking and responsive. The kickstand on the back continues to be fantastic, while the build quality is top notch.The new Pentium Gold 4425Y performs more or less the same as the Pentium Gold 4415Y in the original Surface Go, according to both benchmarks and real-world experience. That means it’s not exactly fast, but is capable of more than you might imagine.Photo editing in Affinity Photo was a just little slow for complex tasks, word processing and general office duties were no bother, while the new Chromium-based Edge browser handled 10+ tabs with ease. Only a little slowdown was noticeable when you tried to do too much at once, such as updating apps, browsing and using a word processor all at the same time.The tablet even managed to power a 4K display at 60Hz via USB-C without issue.When just used for video playback the Surface Go 2 lasted closer to eight hours, streaming video via Netflix.Like the recent Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3, the Surface Go 2 continues Microsoft’s trend of more repairable devices, and was awarded a score of three out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit, which is two-points better than the previous generation Surface Go.Some of the components are modular but not user-replaceable, except for the detachable keyboard, and repairs must be performed by authorised service providers. The out-of-warranty service fee for the Surface Go 2 from Microsoft is £236.40.The Surface Go 2 ships with Windows 10 Home in S mode, which restricts the installation of apps to those from the Microsoft Store for greater security. Turning off S mode is a one-time operation that cannot be reversed, but it takes just a couple of clicks.S mode is great if you live within Microsoft’s ecosystem, or if everything you need is in the Microsoft Store, but it blocks the installation of programs such as Chrome, WhatsApp desktop and Signal, which aren’t available.As a productivity machine the Surface Go 2 is solid. It managed everything I do as a journalist without much fuss, including simple word processing, spreadsheet-wrangling, browsing, note taking, image editing and video conferencing. It would struggle with serious video editing.The slightly larger 10.5in screen helps with split-screen multi-tasking, such as Evernote on the right and PDFs on the left of the screen, but still requires lots of sideways scrolling in documents and websites.As a home-entertainment machine, things are little trickier. The great screen and good speakers make the Surface Go 2 good for video, but there’s still an large app gap compared to Apple’s iPad.The Microsoft Store sells movies and TV shows, and has a great Netflix app, including offline downloads, Virgin TV Go, Demand 5 and iTunes. But others such as Disney+, Amazon Video, Google Play Movies, ITV Hub, BBC iPlayer, All4 and Sky Go have to be viewed in a browser.BBC iPlayer and Sky Go have fairly clunky programs that allow offline downloads, but they are not in the Microsoft Store, so not accessible in S mode.Reading apps are equally few and far between, with no Kindle, Comixology or Marvel Unlimited apps at all.One big advantage Windows 10 has over Apple’s iPad OS is support for multiple users. This includes limited and monitored kids’ accounts, which work great with Windows Hello face recognition.The Surface Go 2’s Type Cover keyboard is the same as the previous version and is cross-compatible, costing £100 or £125, depending on the material.The Type Cover is one of the best keyboards available on any laptop or tablet, matching those available for the larger Surface Pro 7, but with a slightly smaller layout, which took about five minutes to get used to.The keys feel great and the trackpad is smooth, responsive and accurate. It will beat any keyboard and trackpad fitted to any Windows laptop or Chromebook under £500, and should have been included in the price of the tablet.The Surface Go 2 once again proves that budget Windows PCs can be good.It won’t win any awards for speed, but it will handle most things without locking up or driving you nuts. The magnesium body and 10.5in screen are far better than what you’ll get elsewhere for under £400, while the kickstand and range of accessories are great.As with the original, the app gap means the Surface Go 2 is a better productivity machine than media-consumption tablet. But it’s also good for sharing with the family, and is up to being your only computer or used as an ultraportable second computer.The 64GB version will be slower as it uses eMMC storage instead of the faster SSD technology. And while £399 is an extremely attractive starting price, it doesn’t include the essential £100 Type Cover keyboard.Other than wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5 support, only the slightly larger 10.5in screen really separates the lower-end Pentium Gold Surface Go 2 models from the equally excellent original, so look out for cut-price deals.At the real price of £499 or more, you can certainly get a more powerful Windows laptop, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better experience. The gutsy little Surface Go 2 is simply great.Cons: relatively short battery life, no USB-A ports, £100 keyboard essential but not included, relatively slow performance This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

In my lifetime in Rome, I’ve experienced the city almost empty on a few occasions: usually late-night and early-morning walks home, but nothing like the past two months.On 11 March, Rome was silenced. Doors were closed, residents stayed inside and the pace of a frenetic city slowed to that of a faint beat. For 54 days there was no traffic, no street-side chatter and no tourists. The only movement was that of the delivery bikes and scooters passing in the streets below the apartment.On 4 May, when the centro storico reopened, we returned to our city. The oval-shaped Piazza Navona became a jogging track, Piazza della Rotonda turned into a great training ground for fledgling cyclists and Corso Vittorio Emanuele II was commandeered by skateboarders. For two weeks, we lived in our own utopia – it was just us and Rome. Even the former golden boy of Italian football, Roma’s Francesco Totti, and wife Ilary, enjoyed the empty streets. As of 18 May, Italy’s bars, restaurants, shops and beauty salons could open for business. So, at 10 am, I walk out of my palazzo in Rome’s historic centre and into a street scene that could be any typical Monday morning: couriers run along the road, handfuls of people enter and exit the tram, and there is a long line for the post office.I call my cousin Giovanna who lives in Prati, a nearby neighbourhood.“It’s weird. It feels like we’re back to normal. Everyone’s at the bar downstairs all baci abbracci (kisses and hugs) but with masks on,” I tell her.I bike to my local market. On via dei Giubbonari, shopkeepers are setting up and residents are walking around. People sit, socially distanced, at the tables of an outdoor cafe. Mostly everyone is wearing a masks. Reality sets in by the time I arrive at Campo de’ Fiori where there are only a handful of vendors, far fewer than there usually are.Pippo and Anastasia Nicosia, flower vendors, came back to Campo on 4 May – and were here this morning at 7am. “It’s much quieter, less people. But we’ve been given a chance to see a Rome that perhaps we lost for a while,” Anastasia says. “Will it pick up? We need to wait before we have an idea what reality will be like … before we have equilibrio.”She is talking about balance, because right now there is none. The main streets of Rome, such as Via del Corso and Via dei Condotti, are misleadingly busy. There are even buskers, including Luiza Constantin, but shoppers are few. On Via dei Condotti, I bump into Arthur, who came out to be the first to enjoy the boutiques before the return of the crowds. I like his positivity.At Ciampini Caffè, on Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina, I smile when I see that about half of its outdoor tables have customers. “I think people are cautious,” says waiter Vicenzo Macri, “We just need to wait a few weeks to see what things will be like. And I have hope that they will be better.”On side streets, shopkeepers anxiously await patrons but other shops are closed, protesting against the government, the pandemic and the lack of clear-cut protocols. Some restaurants will open, like Luciano Cucina - who has set up distinct dining shifts – but others have opted to remain shuttered while they plan a strategy for survival.Only my local cycle shop, Cicli di Bartolomei, on Piazza di Santa Caterina della Rota, seems to be kicking into a higher gear at reopening – and rightfully so. Rome is finally attempting to make good on its promise to turn the city into a bike-friendly one, with economic assistance for those who buy bicycles, push- and electric scooters and e-bikes. Alessandro di Bartolomei tells me his retired mother has had to come in to the shop and help out, as it has been so busy since reopening on 4 May.I make my way home, meandering the side streets. At the Pantheon, a woman takes the perfect Instagram photo of her mother, two businessmen walk quickly across the square and a man enters a sandwich shop, all set to a melodic, live soundtrack of birds chirping. It feels like Ferragosto, August 15, AKA Rome’s beautiful full stop.Rome is trying to find her equilibrio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea064285cbd7999753d717ee60092be3a369d1b9/585_230_2295_1376/master/2295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b83a8654dc06b4e8fadeecc37b27609b","title":"10 best novels set in greece corfu kefalonia crete","story":"From the natural beauty of Corfu and Kefalonia to the caves and myths of Crete, Greece has inspired writers for millenniaFirst cheat – some would say this isn’t a novel I would say it’s one of the first. I have never stood on the deck of a Greek ferry, watching the islands slip by, without thinking of the magnificent, mercurial character of Odysseus. And the descriptions of Greece! “Rosy-fingered dawn” is undeniable. Some people have problems with the “wine-dark sea”, but really, take a good look at the right time. The only problem is picking the best translation. I’m a fan of Lattimore, Fagles and Fitzgerald. I am also very excited to read a new one by Emily Wilson. In fact, I’ve read the same book in several different versions, which must count for something, including a bad attempt at the original Greek. It’s a foundation for all reading.Mary Renault was one of the writers who sent me to Greece in the first place. I read her in my early teens and her “historical” takes on myth are still a firm favourite. This, and its sequel The Bull from the Sea, are a retelling of the life of Theseus, and the first book has action in the Peloponnese, Crete and Athens – all places that have played an important part in my life. Renault does not shy away from the difficult aspects residing in these tales. There is dark stuff here, and no real heroes, either. If you enjoyed Game of Thrones, Renault might be where to go next.The location of the unnamed village in Little Infamies is not given, and Karnezis has said it is not necessarily even Greek, although all the names and details point in that direction. I like to imagine it in the Peloponnese, but perhaps only because that’s the region whose villages I know best. A series of interconnecting short stories lays bare the local life, and anyone familiar with this environment will find it deeply familiar. Even the mythological touches make sense – you’re always half-expecting a centaur to pop up in Greece and engage you in conversation. There are dark secrets beneath the surface of the village, but Karnezis always treats his characters with deep affection.With all this myth and nature roiling around it is good to remind ourselves that the Greeks are also famous for science, maths and logic. Not that this book is without emotion. Uncle Petros is a mathematician laid low by an unsolvable problem, and generally considered a failure. Only his unnamed nephew still thinks he may be redeemable. Don’t be scared off by the maths: this is essentially a study of a human relationship. In between all this we get a superb rendering of a certain facet of Athens, with its old houses and apartments, courtyard gardens and elegant decay.Crete, particularly its mountains and southern coast, was one of my first loves in Greece, so I have to include a couple of books about the island. I must also include some Kazantzakis. Zorba is too obvious, although I do recommend it, and it (secretly) took its inspiration from the Peloponnese, despite being set in Crete. This brooding tale of Captain Michalis (the original title of the book) takes place during the Turkish occupation, and the fact that the local Turkish bey is his blood brother shows the complications of the time. It all boils up into a properly Shakespearean tragedy while showing the characters’, and the author’s, deep love of their island.Caves are important in Greece, providing a connection between our world and the hidden one. Herakles and Orpheus both descended to Hades through one, and Theseus’s labyrinth is surely another. I once climbed down a steel ladder into a deep cave in the Cretan mountains. At the bottom was a rather macabre shrine to a local saint, lit only by my feeble torch. I had an absolute panic attack, and blame much of it on this book, an intriguing mix of adventure story, mythology and horror. It’s not a masterpiece – Durrell’s non-fiction on Greece is better – but it nails that chthonic feeling that rests just below the blue skies and waters of Greece.Talking of dark undercurrents, this little-known book by a famous author gets beneath the skin of Greece magnificently. It is partly set in the Mani, a rocky and often barren part of the southern mainland where my family lived for several years. It is a starkly beautiful area, dotted with tower house fortifications and small Byzantine chapels, but there is always something lurking in the landscape. Imagine a breeze through olive trees for a moment, and then see what DeLillo does with it: “Wind blew across the olive groves, causing a wild tremor, a kind of panic, treetops going silver.” Anyone who has visited this part of the world outside of the somnambulant summer will instantly know this.This is possibly my favourite book on this list, mainly because I have spent many an evening reading it to my kids. The Greek myths can be deeply weird and confusing – check out the Robert Graves version if you don’t believe me – but children seem to cope with them much more intuitively than adults. The premise behind this collection is genius. Atticus, a tale teller, sets off from his home in Crete to a festival of stories near Troy, travelling through much of Greece. On the way, in exchange for food, lodging and transportation, he relates the myths that are appropriate to the area, starting with the birth of Zeus and ending with the Trojan war. It’s ostensibly a kids’ book, but I would happily read this to myself, and much of my knowledge of Greek mythology rests on it.

Next week, the Radio 4 soap returns with life in Ambridge under lockdown.Writing in the Radio Times, Howe says: “We had to start from scratch, and we had to figure out a new way to make The Archers so that everything – absolutely everything – could be done remotely. It was probably the biggest challenge the programme has ever had to face.”Actors have had to create their own home studios with a microphone on a stand, linked to a computer, and as many duvets as they can find to cocoon themselves in.Before the lockdown, there was lots of communal cricket practice banter and chats in the pub, now restored to its proper name of the Bull rather than The B at Ambridge.The new Archers will reflect contemporary events with newly written stories. Howe said: “I told the team: keep it simple.”Howe said he had been humbled by how well and creatively The Archers’ production team, cast and writers had risen to the challenge of working during the lockdown.The Archers, the world’s longest-running soap opera, has been a fixture of British life since 1951. Originally “an everyday story of country folk” it now bills itself as a “contemporary drama in a rural setting”.The show returns properly on 25 May with stories which feature David and Josh Archer, Tracy Horrobin and police officer Harrison Burns.Howe said there would initially be far fewer characters because of the logistical complexity of what they were doing, but there were plans to bring other favourite characters into the spotlight.He quoted David Archer, who once said: “The sun will always rise and there will always be cows to be milked. Life always goes on.” Howe promised: “So it will be in The Archers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14cbb14d367aadc2e544106eb9f117aa3237a166/1090_326_5447_3269/master/5447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb65455d308f88ccc81f8ac2944b9796","title":"thorne gets horn netflix tv writer jack seedy paris jazz sizzler the eddy","story":"He’s the gritty chronicler of disaffected Britain. So what tempted the writer of This Is England to tackle the Paris jazz scene? Clue: not the jazz. As it launches on Netflix, he tells allThanks to lockdown we’ve become a nation of telly addicts – what else is there left to do? So when I speak to Jack Thorne, the multi-award-winning writer of His Dark Materials, This Is England and new Netflix drama The Eddy, I’m keen to know which prestige TV shows he’s bingeing on.“Anything with Keith Lemon in it,” he says. “Me and my wife get an hour to watch TV at night, otherwise we’re not going to be able to cope with Elliott” – their four-year-old son.Being cooped up at home is nothing new for the writer – who admits to a period of “about seven and a half years when I didn’t really leave the house” due to a mixture of dedication to his work and social anxiety (“I’m very, very awkward”). But watching so little television is certainly novel for Thorne. The 41-year-old grew up in Bristol and Berkshire, and would spend five or six hours a day in front of the TV – mostly on the sofa next to his mum – running straight through from EastEnders to Tim Piggott-Smith in The Chief before the news kicked in at 10.And it didn’t stop there. “My mate lived near the school, so we’d go over at lunchtime and watch Neighbours,” Thorne says. “And then I’d watch it again in the evening. I’d watch the same show twice. In one day. I was a relatively clever kid – what was I doing? I could tell you the entire story of Tony Stamp in The Bill from the moment he started to the moment he left the force.”These might not be the viewing habits you’d expect of someone who has won Bafta and Olivier awards, but Thorne always had his sights set on the small screen. “I remember when I was on work experience at the Royal Court telling Max Stafford-Clark that what I really wanted was to write TV. And he said, ‘What the fuck are you doing here then?’”Whatever it was, it worked. Thorne has managed to combine a prolific screenwriting career with high-profile theatrical endeavours, from Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to the National Theatre of Scotland’s adaptation of Let the Right One In. “I love making theatre,” says Thorne, “but I understand TV because I’ve watched an awful lot of it.”It’s this voracious appetite that perhaps prepared him for the breadth of subject matter he has covered, from interracial adoption in Kiri to the murderous teens of Glue. Thorne moved quickly from theatre into screenwriting, working on Skins in his 20s. It was there that he met a 17-year-old Daniel Kaluuya, long before Hollywood came calling. Despite their differences – “he’d watched Fresh Prince of Bel-Air 400 times, but he’d never seen the Bill” – they hit it off and would later work together again on his apocalyptic teen drama, The Fades. That was Thorne’s first solo TV commission and, despite being cancelled after one series, it won the Bafta for best drama. Its world of angels, the risen dead and apocalypse, could have been offputting to the academy but whatever fantastical scenario Thorne plots out, he manages to make it accessible and grounded.While Netflix has been keen to talk up the involvement of Damien Chazelle, Oscar winning writer-director of La La Land and Whiplash, Thorne says the show was “a massive collaborative effort”. It originated from an idea by acclaimed music producer Glen Ballard and, along with Alan Ball (the creator of Six Feet Under), Chazelle was brought on board to direct before he had hit the big time, while Thorne was the last to join. But it was Thorne who was tasked with crafting the story. The protagonist even shares a name with his son. “We’d just failed our third round of IVF having decided that we’d definitely call him Elliott if he was a boy,” Thorne tells me later over email. “I stole his name for a TV character, essentially.”Which must make it all the more frustrating that some have framed the show as Chazelle’s response to accusations of racial insensitivity in his past projects. La La Land prompted a backlash due to the way it framed a white protagonist as the true spirit of jazz, counterposed with John Legend playing a commercial sell-out. The Eddy also has jazz at its heart, but this time there is a black leading man: Moonlight’s André Holland as club owner Elliot. And that had nothing to do with Chazelle.One advantage of having a successful track record is that Thorne is able to bring such voices on board, and elevate talented writers who might not have had the opportunity yet. “There’s degrees to which I’m trying to bring forward people,” Thorne admits, “but I’m not arrogant enough to think that I’m Father Christmas.”What interested Thorne in The Eddy was not, as one might assume, the music – “I’ve got to be honest, jazz wasn’t really the thing”. He spends far more time talking about city infrastructure (his dad was a town planner), Grenfell and the exclusion of working-class urban communities than he does fivefour rhythms or Louis Armstrong. What really drew him to this story, he says, was the version of Paris it would allow him to examine. This isn’t the picture postcard view, all pretty bridges and the Eiffel Tower. It’s life in the grittier arrondissements.“There’s something about Paris, because of the ring road,” he says. “The exclusivity it creates. I’d spent a lot of time there, I hung out in those places, mostly talking to dealers. I’d seen the lack of infrastructure. There are these incredible high-rise blocks, and then there’s just one shop serving the community. It’s really exciting to explore the melting pot of Paris, with the melting pot of jazz.”Thorne might predominantly write crowdpleasing work but political messages lurk under the surface. He brooks no argument about TV as the opiate of the masses and has been gratified to see the medium garner more respect at a time when it is one of the only forms of culture left to us. “I follow a few famous people on Twitter, who normally talk slightly disparagingly about TV. And it’s been really interesting to see them being so enthusiastic about Quiz or Normal People.”Thorne knows his colourful shows are not exactly Ken Loach – “I’m not as clever or as brilliant as he is” – but doesn’t believe there’s only one way to put forward progressive ideas in entertainment. “I think fantasy allows you to ask the big questions: what’s the point of life, what are we trying to challenge, what are we trying to protect?”And so he worries about what will be left of the arts once the coronavirus crisis has passed. Thorne has been a passionate advocate for a more inclusive attitude towards disability in the industry – and believes things had started to improve. But with money bound to be tight it would be all too easy for things to slip backwards. “I could feel the landscape changing and I’m petrified that when I go back, the theatres won’t have the resources or the energy to support that,” he says. “Because the Arts Council isn’t going to be able to support them all.”Thorne’s next project was set to be a lavish retelling of A Christmas Carol at the Old Vic theatre – which is still due later this year. It’s another adaptation for a writer who is perhaps best known for taking on others’ work.“I love doing other people’s stuff,” he admits. “I learn so much. I’ve spent about four or five years trying to think Philip Pullman’s thoughts. He is one of the cleverest, most soulful writers I’ve ever encountered. And I hope that by spending time with him, I’m making myself into a better writer. If I just wrote my own stuff, I would probably go down that cul-de-sac of being a slightly tormented, anxious, weird man.”And yet that is what he plans to do in the next phase of what he somewhat bashfully calls his career next. “I’m trying to self-generate a bit more,” he says. “I’m trying to be a more conscious about my choices. I feel like I’ve been given a lot of stories, and now I need to work out what stories I want to tell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85645ee438489ba175f1f7564e2ef407fcb85ba4/0_219_3652_2192/master/3652.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9b4fc5c86883c7ccd29215505f8fc9db","title":"people who are shielding how do you feel about the new lockdown rules","story":"As restrictions ease for people who are not subject to health conditions, do you feel forgotten about, isolated or cut off?The UK government has set out its plan to leave lockdown, but the changes will not affect everyone equally.

But we can only allow three people inside at a time, so for now we’ll only be serving snacks and drinks at the bar, and doing food for takeaway.”But while the bars enjoyed a flurry of customers, the first day back for restaurants was more subdued, with many still closed as they prepare their premises for reopening.“We had around six customers over lunchtime,” said Chiara Gargioli of Armando al Pantheon, a popular, family-run trattoria in Rome’s historic centre. “A small number, but it was OK. They were all people who we know.”Italy was the first country in Europe to enforce a nationwide lockdown and is gradually emerging from it. Since 4 May, when manufacturing resumed, parks reopened and people were allowed to visit relatives and partners, there has been a sustained fall in the coronavirus death and contagion rate.As part of the ongoing phase two, which has been called “living with the virus”, civil liberties now include being able to travel freely within inidual regions and to see friends. Restrictions on inter-regional travel will be lifted from 3 June.But while people are venturing out more and businesses can trade again, with the virus still circulating, for the most part they are doing so cautiously.Along Orvieto’s main thoroughfare only one restaurant, Gallo d’Oro, opened for lunch, and the only customer was the . Other restaurants are expected to follow suit later this week. Owners need to ensure that tables are at least 1 metre apart and are disinfected between sittings. Customers must pre-book and wear masks as they enter a restaurant and whenever they leave their tables. Staff must wear masks and gloves at all times. Hand disinfectant and plastic gloves are available for customers outside Gallo d’Oro before they enter.“After all this time indoors, we just wanted to try and get going again and regain some sort of normality, even though our expectations were not high,” said Titiana Corbi, who manages the restaurant. “A few people have called out of curiosity, but we are yet to take any bookings.”Italians may be hesitant about eating out, but they were keen to get back the hairdresser. Anna Paciaccone, who runs a salon a short walk away from Gallo d’Oro, has been busy since she opened. “People booked before today and had to specify exactly what they wanted over the phone. The distancing rules have so far worked really well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4f2647fde2602339e8ff58fab13a5af11a93a8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dba0eb98157c4e7d77d963ed57cb773","title":"five organisations in the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine","story":"Moderna, CanSino, Oxford University, Imperial College London and Inovio are all making progressMany companies and institutions are in a race to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Here are some of them:Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate was the first to enter clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January. On Monday, the US biotech company said interim data from a phase one trial involving 45 people found it produced Covid-19 antibodies in all participants, including at low doses, at similar or higher levels to people who had actually contracted the virus. It said it was “generally safe and well tolerated” by the triallists. It also found that mRNA-1273 provided full protection against viral replication in the lungs in a mouse challenge model.The Chinese company CanSino Biologics has become the first contender to move its candidate vaccine – Ad5-nCoV – into a phase two clinical trial, which is taking place in Wuhan. However, CanSino, which is working with the medical sciences arm of the People’s Liberation Army, has not published detailed results of the phase one trial, saying only that it was moving to phase two based on “the preliminary safety data” from phase one, which involved about 500 people.The university’s ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is being tested on more than 1,000 volunteers aged between 18 and 55 in a phase one trial which began last month. A pre-print – a research paper which has not yet been peer-reviewed – on the vaccine’s efficacy in rhesus macaques, published on Monday, found that it did prevent them from getting the disease (pneumonia) but did not protect them from the infection, creating concerns that, if replicated in humans, it would mean it would not be able to prevent transmission to others. The results from the human trial could be available this month. AstraZeneca, the Cambridge-based pharmaceutical group, has teamed up with Oxford University to manufacture and distribute the vaccine if the trials show it is effective.Imperial is developing a vaccine in a form that has not been tested before in people, leaving it behind some of the other contenders which have skipped animal studies because their technology has been previously used on humans. The team, led by Prof Robin Shattock, has been testing with animals since early February and is due to begin human trials in June. It initially received £22.5m in government funding and on Sunday it was announced that it had been given an additional £18.5m which it hopes will enable it to launch phase three clinical trials later this year. However, Shattock cautioned on Monday that it is highly unlikely a vaccine in the UK will be available for use by September.The US biotech company Inovio has existed for four decades without developing an approved product but its stock soared after it started its trial last month. It says its INO-4800 candidate vaccine resulted in promising immune responses in preclinical models. The company has enrolled 40 healthy people for its phase one trial. It is hoping it could advance to phase twothree efficacy trials this summer. The company has received a total of $17.2m (£14m) in grants from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for the vaccine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dea5942c2a1bbfb9f9cfa415ecad0e95b3c7088/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a22361bee561ca9c1464d31054595abb","title":"how a facebook group has helped those bereaved by coronavirus","story":"Yellow Hearts To Remember was set up by David Gompertz to do justice to the scale of loss When she walked out of Harrogate hospital where her 58-year-old husband Leo had just died after contracting Covid-19, Joanne Ciavarella said she had never felt more alone in the world.“I wasn’t allowed anyone else with me. I had to walk out that hospital and drive home on my own knowing that my husband had just died,” she said. “I don’t know how my legs carried me.”She then had to recover from the virus herself at home, self-isolating with her 13-year-old son and unable to see her friends or her parents, who are in their 70s. So when she came across the Yellow Hearts To Remember Facebook group, it became a lifeline.“I was absolutely desperate for that contact and to know that other people were having the same experiences, and the grief that I was going through alone was normal to some extent,” she said. “I’ve had so many Facebook messages from people I don’t even know saying: ‘We’re in the same boat.’”The group was set up by David Gompertz, 83, with help from his family, after losing his wife, Sheila, to the virus. He felt the government’s daily death toll figure didn’t do justice to the scale of the loss from Covid-19, and wanted to create a group encouraging the bereaved to pin yellow hearts in their window, as a symbol of remembrance.But since the group’s creation a couple of weeks ago, it has grown into something much more – a warm and welcoming community of thousands sharing stories and pictures of lost loved ones.“I just do two or three minutes and weep, because the people on there are all sizes and shapes, ethnic groups and ages. It’s just devastating,” Gompertz said. “And we don’t own it anymore. That Facebook page is owned by all those people who posted.” One of those is Charlotte Compton, whose dad, 91-year-old James Jones, died in April after contracting coronavirus.Like many she faced the difficulty of organising a funeral and having to choose which family members were able to attend.“The toughest thing for me was, at the funeral, not being able to hug my family,” she said. “A social media platform is no substitute for that at all, but it’s comforting to have some kind of virtual love from people you don’t even know but who understand everything that you’re going through.”She also came across another Facebook group which encourages people to light a candle in their window at 8pm every Sunday to remember those who have died.“It sounds quite small, but I really found it very comforting,” she said. “I felt calm and peaceful because I just felt everybody who is in a similar situation can feel a sense of belonging and togetherness, some unity which somehow makes grief more bearable.”While digital tributes are offering some solace to people grieving for coronavirus victims, families are now calling for a more permanent tribute. Ciavarella has written to Boris Johnson asking for his support in planting a forest of trees, one for each victim of the virus, as a lasting memorial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d46aa7e432fd10279230e96b74b30cfc05eb7a4/0_99_4774_2865/master/4774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0e65d59e3c083c0e8bb263644f47ad0","title":"mexico amlo coronavirus covid19 restrictions reopen","story":"About 300 localities without confirmed virus cases are allowed to resume economic activities, but Amlo warns to maintain disciplineLocal authorities across Mexico have resisted President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s call to lift emergency coronavirus measures in municipalities without confirmed Covid-19 cases, warning that the pandemic is far from over.Mexico has registered nearly 50,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 5,000 deaths, and its testing rate ranks among the lowest in Latin America, with just 0.4 tests per 1,000 people.But on Monday, approximately 300 municipalities throughout the country – called “municipalities of hope” – were given the green light to restart economic activities and lift sheltering-in-place recommendations. Similar measures are scheduled to start 1 June in the rest of the country, while classes will resume the same day.“We need to maintain discipline, not relax this discipline since we’re almost there,” said López Obrador, commonly called Amlo. “I have a lot of faith and many expectations that we’re going to finish taming this pandemic.”The decision to resume comes amid questions over the Amlo administration’s coronavirus response, which has depended heavily on disease modeling and involved little testing and no contact tracing.Mexico has also come under pressure from the United States to reopen its economy as factories near the border form important links in continental supply chains. Companies wanting to resume construction, mining and manufacturing activities could apply for permission starting Monday, Amlo said.But the move to reopen the economic comes amid an ongoing row over the scale of Mexico’s coronavirus crisis. Amlo has been infuriated by a string of stories in foreign media outlets alleging that his government has undercounted Covid-19 deaths.Amlo returned to the theme at his daily press conference on Monday, accusing international media of wanting to damage his government and spreading disinformation.Physicians and public health experts express disquiet that the country is opening too quickly and the model used to guide Mexico’s Covid-19 response is unable to produce granular information for knowing which municipalities to open.“We’re at the peak and this peak could last a week or two weeks or who knows how long. It remains to be seen,” said Asisclo de Jesús Villagómez a former president of Mexico’s college of critical care medicine.“I think they should be taking measures for when things reopen, but not putting a date on it.”“We’re flying blind,” added Xavier Tello, a physician and healthcare consultant. He said Mexico only tests suspected Covid-19 cases if symptoms are severe – something producing low coronavirus statistics.Still, the coronavirus tsar, Hugo López-Gatell, has insisted that “the curve is flattening” and Amlo has told the country “we’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.”The 324 municipalities scheduled to reopen were chosen if there were no recorded Covid-19 cases over the previous 28 days and cases were not rising in neighbouring municipalities.Analysts found flaws in the selection process, however no Covid-19 tests were carried out in two-thirds of the municipalities reopening, according to an investigation by Valería Moy, director of the NGO México, ¿Cómo Vamos?Many of the chosen municipalities are also small and isolated and among the most marginalised in Mexico. More than 200 of the municipalities set to reopen in Oaxaca are governed by traditional rules known as “uses and customs” which are common in indigenous communities.The governors of Jalisco and Chihuahua states said municipalities there would remain closed to conform with statewide Covid-19 restrictions. Local officials in Oaxaca and Guerrero states also seemed unwilling to reopen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/666e8a11be2bbc5d9489af4f21779fcd804ff0a1/0_227_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a01695a3b34e8dd07d3fad2c388df3f","title":"monica lewinsky among thousands to share last normal photo","story":"UK journalist Robyn Vinter gets thousands of replies after asking people to share images of life before lockdownRobyn Vinter knew something was happening when she saw a reply from Monica Lewinsky. Vinter, a Leeds-based journalist, had sent a Saturday morning tweet which contained a simple request: “I would like to see the last normal pic on your phone.”Within hours she had thousands of replies, including one from the woman best known for her part in a political scandal involving the former US president Bill Clinton.“I spotted Jon Ronson had replied, and a couple more fairly high-profile people and then I noticed Monica Lewinsky had,” said Vinter. “I thought: that’s weird, how did she find my little tweet out of nowhere? Then I saw there were thousands of replies.”Vinter’s simple tweet soon took on a life of its own, with almost 8,000 replies, revealing people’s desire for a glimpse of life before lockdown. The hashtag #lastnormalphoto began trending this weekend, with people from across the globe posting the last picture they took before the lockdown measures brought normal life to an end in March.Pictures range from mundane snapshots of life, such as parents and children embarking on their final school run before classrooms were closed, to more joyous occasions including birthday parties with people hugging and chatting in groups – with barely 2cm between them let alone 2 metres – before lockdown made physical distancing mandatory.There’s a shot from the Champions League tie between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid on 11 March, while several people sent images from meet-ups with elderly relatives. Lewinsky sent a picture of a bouquet of flowers she had received.“There are a lot of things that people would have chosen to do if they knew it was coming. It’s a frozen moment in time, I suppose,” said Vinter.Originally inspired by a BBC article, which asked for readers to send photographs, the hashtag is the latest photo callout to become popular on social media. Others include Covid-19 specific themes (#beforesocialdistancing, #sociallydistanced, #nosocialdistancinghere), the nostalgic (#happiertimes, #untilnexttime, #misstheolddays) and the exasperated (#whenwillitend, #2020cancelled).Vinter, who works for the Yorkshire Post and founded the Overtake news site, says there is a question mark over whether the pictures are actually the last ones taken before lockdown, or the most social-media-friendly option.“You could tell some of them were curated,” she said. “It wasn’t actually their last normal picture. It was one they had chosen because it was cool or they thought it made them look good. So there’s an element of narcissism involved.”Vinter puts the popularity of the hashtag down to a combination of that narcissism and nostalgia, as people scroll through their phones and pick out a snapshot of their former life. “It’s nice for people to reflect on what they were doing especially because life changed so quickly,” she says. “People had a feeling that something was going to happen, but no one knew the necessary extreme it would go to.”Vinter’s own entry to the hashtag was of her in a charity shop as she sized up a mirror that she was considering buying. “There was a weird 1970s mirror that I liked, so I’d just taken a picture of it. I wanted to have a think about it and imagine where it might go in my house and then go back for it,” she said.“Obviously the charity shop is shut, but I’m hoping it’s still there and no one has got to it in the meantime.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef010b60dff4602cdd6d13006c6836058808cd90/0_0_6144_3688/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b3c72f7ebf8cb1307fbf8b1ef66b2a","title":"more than 1800 private planes landed in uk during covid 19 lockdown","story":"Figure includes privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flightsAt least 1,800 private aircraft landed in the UK during lockdown, official figures have shown, with no requirement for arriving passengers to provide contact details for purposes of tracking the spread of coronavirus.In response to a question from the Conservative peer Baroness Anelay of St Johns, the Home Office said that between 17 March and 14 April, 1,812 private aircraft flights landed at airports in the UK.The figure include privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flights. A breakdown was not provided.In the written answer, the Home Office minister, Baroness Williams of Trafford, said: “There is no Public Health England requirement to record contact details for arriving or departing passengers for Covid-19 purposes.”The UK’s border policy before and during the lockdown is facing increased scrutiny. The government previously revealed that just 273 out of the 18.1 million people who entered the UK in the three months prior to the coronavirus lockdown were formally quarantined.Since 13 March, government policy has been to inform passengers arriving at the border of the measures in place in the UK through posters, screens and leaflets. There has been no enforced quarantine or thermal screening.On 10 May, Boris Johnson said that air passengers arriving in the UK would soon be required to self-isolate. It is now understood that this will also apply to land and sea arrivals.Experts have questioned the scientific basis behind introducing such a policy at this stage in the pandemic and the travel and tourism industry has warned of dire consequences for the sector if such a policy is pursued."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de5dfc4fdfc5465e4b618de9ad479c172baaf9e/0_148_3895_2337/master/3895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac1189dde192cff60313274e598209d","title":"china puts city of shulan under wuhan style lockdown after fresh covid 19 cases","story":"Measures tightened further in city of 700,000 close to Russian border that has been deemed a high-risk areaChinese authorities have sealed off the north-eastern city of Shulan, home to about 700,000 people, after an outbreak of coronavirus, imposing measures similar to those used in Wuhan.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials.It comes as Beijing signalled it could ease some border restrictions as it prepares for the start on Thursday of its signature political event, the Communist party’s delayed annual congress, also known as the “two sessions”.In Shulan, residential compounds were restricted to just one entry and exit for emergency vehicles, and banned non-residents and vehicles from entering. If there are confirmed cases in a community residence, no one can enter or leave.Last week, the city was reclassified as high risk after a cluster of cases emerged connected to a woman with no known history of travel or exposure to the virus. In response, authorities ordered the temporary closure of public places, schools and public transport.On Monday however these restrictions were increased further, with China Daily referring to the city as “the latest pandemic hotspot in the country”. It said hundreds of people were under medical quarantine, and that life might not go back to normal for weeks.The north-east of the country, which borders Russia and North Korea, has emerged as an area of serious concern, as cases appear to have been brought in from across the border, and then begun to spread locally.At least 34 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Jilin province in the past fortnight.Despite the highest level of lockdowns prompted by just a few dozen cases, Chinese media have said the country can handle more imported cases and will likely begin opening up again.Chinese media has reported the country is likely to ease its border controls after the two sessions meeting, which begins Thursday.Relaxed entry rules could apply to Chinese students overseas who want to return home after graduating, and business travellers, but not large numbers of tourists yet, according to academics quoted by the Global Times.Zhou Zijun, a public health expert at Peking university, told the paper China “can now properly handle a small level of imported cases”.Discussions were reportedly beginning between countries including China, Japan and South Korea, about opening channels for business travel, with strict testing requirements.On Monday China reported six new cases of Covid-19, of which three were local transmissions. Two were in Jilin province, and one in Hubei. The national health commission also reported 17 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases.Chinese authorities are particularly sensitive to the possibility of further outbreaks, just days out from its annual “two sessions”, which had been postponed from March because of the coronavirus. While there are extra measures in place to ensure the meeting of party delegates goes ahead safely, it is a sign that Beijing believes it is beginning to go back to normal.At the end of April tens of millions of people travelled for the first time in months over a five-day national holiday, and quarantine requirements on people arriving in Beijing were lifted.Housing officials in charge of residences have been warned they will be removed from their roles if there are new outbreaks, prompting speculation this could backfire and lead to local cover-ups. Some officials in Wuhan – where another small outbreak recently prompted an ambitious plan to test all 11 million residents – and Jilin province have already been removed from their posts, Chinese media has reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a62aa6bb20a0bb708e1ae146956a2a41dd8344/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53effc07cc36de3c7c5724ffb801ef24","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:There are 4,805,005 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The death toll stands at 318,534. US deaths, the highest worldwide, passed 90,000, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.Late on Monday evening, Donald Trump tweeted a letter addressed to World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that if the WHO “does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.” The letter does not detail what the improvements are.Before Trump’s letter was released, the World Health Organization said on Monday that an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible . A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO’s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO’s 194 states. The motion is expected to be voted on on Tuesday.After US president told reporters at the White House that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, his doctor released a letter confirming that they had discussed the use of the drug and “concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.” A White House spokesperson told the New York Times that Trump was prescribed the drug and is taking it. The US Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France.The death toll in Australia has reached 100, following the death of a 93-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with Covid-19.The woman had been a resident at Newmarch House, the aged care home in western Sydney which has been the site of a cluster of cases.The number of confirmed cases in India has passed 100,000, currently standing at 100,328 according to Johns Hopkins University figures.The country has recorded 3,156 deaths. The government this week extended a nationwide lockdown to the end of May, but with significantly reduced restrictions, including allowing markets and standalone shops can reopen from Monday, with social distancing measures.

Photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy.It was the day for which the nation has been pining: the freedom to play a socially distant game of golf or tennis - within five kilometers from home - and then the unbearable excitement of stopping off at the hardware store on the way home.Galway could go out again. Sort of. So needless to say, the weather was a drag.Galway city responded to phase one of Irelands’ great economic re-awakening with a few small queues of customers outside the retail parks but the city’s high street won’t feel right again until the day the many, many pubs can throw open their many doors. If someone dropped a coin at the top of Quay Street on Monday noontime, you might have heard it hit the cobbles down around Sally Longs.Farrell’s garage on Brendan’s Avenue is a city institution run by brothers Gay and Patsy. They also work in sculpture and art when they aren’t fixing motors. Monday morning was the first time their garage has been open in seven weeks. “It is just nice to get back in again and get something done,” says Gay.“There was no warning really as such. We just had to shut up shop and get out of it. We did one or two emergency jobs for HSE people during the lockdown. That was it.”They have had work booked in for weeks so they are going to be busy in the weeks ahead. But the road outside their business remains quiet. “Normally you see cars going up and down Brendan’s Avenue.”Still, this was a start. It was possibly Oscar Wilde who declared that you know your youth has passed when you find yourself standing examining electrical drills in an aisle in Woodies on a Saturday morning.This may be true but it is also true that the Irish have a strange and needy relationship with the DIY and gardening behemoth. Any promise of sunshine prompts national raids on the barbeque and outdoor furnishing sections.It may have helped the safety policy that this Monday was overcast and cool. Still, with Woodies having spent half a million euro on Covid-19 safety measures, the lines outside the Terryland and Wellpark branches were considerable. You had to really want that bag of compost, that ten litres of masonry paint in order to wait. And many people did.The story was similar in other stores. DID Electrical had been operating as an online facility but on Monday its doors were opened - and monitored. “Take your time,” said one customer who told the door-staff that he was after a vacuum cleaner. “The sooner I get it the sooner I have to go home and do the hoovering.”The new shopping reality is going to demand patience. The number of customers permitted in stores at once is dependent on square footage and staff available. So at DID’s Briarhill branch, for instance, six people are allowed browse the aisles at any one time. The stores were busy and the arrival of people was fairly constant.In the city though, things remained slow.“It is different,” says Tadhg Byrne of Thomas Woodberrys wine shop on Middle Street.“Different. Interesting. Quieter and busier because it is all deliveries now. We open from 11 to 4 and then do the deliveries in the evening. For the first week I think we had four walk in customers. It is getting progressively busier. The two busiest days for walk-ins were last Friday and Saturday.“In fairness, people were staying at home. They were making the effort. You do see more people walking around. Saturday was really busy but . .\u0026nbsp. we were just saying, it is probably the weather today.”At least that much is back to normal.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via GettyWith the lifting of some Covid-19 restrictions this week, Ireland has moved on to a new phase of its battle against the virus.The liberties we have reclaimed since Monday are for now meagre and tentative, with the fear of a second wave of the epidemic not far from our thoughts.Yet how we fare from here on is to a large extent in our hands, inidually and collectively. A flexible, nimble and directed approach to keeping Covid-19 in check can yield impressive results in terms of winning us new liberties and easing restrictions according to the timetable in the Government’s plan and, perhaps, even faster.So far, our performance is midtable at best, in international terms. There is the sense of a half-defeat being wrestled from the jaws of victory. We had extra time to prepare before the virus came here compared with other EU countries, and to put in place a coherent strategy informed by the best scientific advice.This helped us win the battle in our hospitals, where ICUs were comfortably able to cope with the surge of cases that came their way. With the experience gained, there can be confidence that hospitals can cope even better should the virus stage a substantial return.Yet even as this was happening, coronavirus was making its way into nursing homes and other care settings with devastating effect. Apart maybe from Canada, Ireland has the highest proportion of Covid-19 deaths occurring in care homes. For reasons that have yet to be fully explained and will require formal investigation, the disease ripped through these settings before effective action was taken.That situation has now been stabilised, but a new challenge has arisen in meat factories. As with care homes, the problems here have as much to do with staff practices outside the workplace – arising from the sharing of accommodation, for example – as behaviours on the job.Three controlsGovernments effectively have three means of controlling the epidemic now, during the post-lockdown phase testing and contract tracing, travel restrictions, and social distancing.The greater movement allowed to us as we move through the phases of the Government’s plan is likely to lead to more cases, but we can clamp down on spread by ensuring rapid testing and contact tracing is in place. And, if we choose, we can double down on border controls to protect against the importation of fresh cases.The HSE’s promise to test and trace contacts of the vast majority of cases within three days is welcome, although an even shorter turnaround time would be better. Border controls will matter more as international travel resumes and the airports fill up again, which is why the filling-in of a passenger locator form becomes obligatory from this week.As society loosens up, we will see more cases in private homes and workplaces. We need to reduce the proportion of cases caused by community transmission, which currently account for 60 per cent of the total.To some extent, we can lessen the risk by redesigning our shared spaces – for example, by getting rid of cramped accommodation units. Great outdoors?Our default advice is still to stay at home, but for the limited social interaction that is now allowed, the outdoors is the best option for the coming months. In Japan, which has one of the lowest Covid-19 death rates, epidemiologists advise people to avoid “the three Cs – Conversation in poorly ventilated, Close, Crowded spaces”.Despite the focus recently on masks and asymptomatic transmission, it is important to remember that the way this virus is passed on is mainly through close and prolonged contact, and mostly by people who have just started to show symptoms. This happens most in enclosed environments such as households, long-term care settings and high-density public transport.Conversely, short, casual interactions are low risk, provided you keep your distance. And, it is worth repeating, children do not pose any greater infection risk than other people.By acting smartly, we can stamp out new outbreaks quickly, rebuild the economy and even buy ourselves room to experiment a bit – for example, by getting some children back to school on a trial basis.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4256646.1589829988!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"workplace safety watchdog may not be able to make surprise inspections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSA will confirm to the Oireachtas committee that it is assigning 67 field inspectors out of its 109-strong inspectorate to check on workplace safety under the Covid-19 Return to Work Safely protocolThe Health and Safety Authority may not be able to carry out surprise inspections due to restrictions to protect against Covid-19, its chief executive Dr Sharon McGuinness will tell an Oireachtas committee on Tuesday.“As a general rule, authority inspections are unannounced. However, due to the fact that workplaces may have different working arrangements in place to protect against Covid-19, the authority may need in a number of cases to arrange a suitable time to visit,” the head of the workplace safety watchdog will tell the committee.The authority will also confirm to the committee at Tuesday’s hearing that it is assigning 67 field inspectors out of its 109-strong inspectorate to check on workplace safety under the Covid-19 Return to Work Safely protocol.InspectorsDr McGuinness will say the authority must retain a cohort of inspectors to ensure the authority’s “other legal obligations are met across our various mandates”.It plans to focus Covid-19 inspections on sectors due to open under the Government’s reopening plan and based on complaints received.Ahead of the hearing, Dr McGuinness told The  in an interview that determining whether a fatality from Covid-19 resulted from an infection contracted in a workplace or a work activity was a “real challenge”.She said that it was “very tricky” to determine whether a coronavirus death was a result of workplace activity.“One of the challenges for all of us in relation to Covid is that there may have been worker fatalities where Covid was a factor – whether it happened in the workplace or not, or as a result of a work activity, is a different question,” she said.“It is not as simple to say a worker contracted Covid and there was a fatality. We have to check that that actually happened in the workplace or was it attributable to the work activity going on?”Dr McGuinness encouraged greater engagement between employers and employees under a protocol published by the Government to ensure that workers adhered to health and safety guidelines at home where there were large numbers of workers living in shared rental accommodation.Clusters“Covid is everywhere and our remit is very much in the workplace. People coming to and from work, how people live outside work, none of that is in our remit but clearly the activities and actions in that regard can have an impact in the workplace,” she said.A spokesman said that more than 200 complaints received by the HSA in March and April in relation to non-adherence to Covid-19 guidances did not require on-site inspections.The spread of the virus in meat processing plants where there are 12 clusters – or one in every four plants in the country – with as many as 600 infected workers is attributed in part to the number of lower-paid foreign workers sharing accommodation outside of workplaces.The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan told the Department of Health’s week-daily Covid-19 briefing that the national outbreak control teams issued guidance in different languages on risks facing employees who are travelling to work together or sharing accommodation.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Researchers find Northern Ireland faces \u0026lsquoserious democratic deficit\u0026rsquo due to BrexitAbsence of government formation would prohibit Offences against State Act renewalIrish adolescents less likely to say they drink or smoke, but many suffer cyberbullyingDr Elysha Brennan, who survived cancer, is helping health staff who have caught virusSecretary general of Department of Health set to tell D\u0026aacuteil committee that the social and economic costs of Covid-19 have been \u0026lsquohuge\u0026rsquoNorth West members delighted to be back on the fairways in Lisfannon, Co DonegalSince Covid-19 restrictions, people could only drive through amenity but not park thereCustomers \u0026lsquounderstanding and co-operative\u0026rsquo as long queues form outside some outlets\u0026lsquoWe need more large-volume food donations from the food industry\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash FoodCloud boss\u0026lsquoEver-present danger\u0026rsquo of further Covid-19 cases as Ireland partially lifts restrictionsHSA chief says determining whether a virus death is related to workplace is \u0026lsquovery tricky\u0026rsquoForeign nationals in meat plants and living in direct provision still lack details on virus \u0026ndash campaignerCrash barriers but no long queues outside flagship Woodie\u0026rsquos storeFinancial predicament of Headfort School in Kells exacerbated by pandemic, court hearsAccused was also charged with two counts of attempted rape and 39 counts of sexual assaultDPP also appeals sentence on basis that it was too lenientCllr Donna Cooney says cycling and walking infrastructure is \u0026lsquounsafe\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoinsulting\u0026rsquoBut Taoiseach says it would be disingenuous to have a \u0026lsquoPlan B\u0026rsquo to government formation talksFamily court hears man was \u0026lsquoparanoid\u0026rsquo about virus and drank excessively every nightStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4256637.1589829362!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"life satisfaction for irish teens ranked among lowest in europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe World Health Organisation (WHO) study featured survey responses from more than 227,000 children aged 11, 13, and 15, from 44 different European countries and Canada.

Only 11-year-olds seemed more content, ranking 25th in their age group for life satisfaction.The World Health Organisation (WHO) study featured survey responses from more than 227,000 children aged 11, 13, and 15, from 44 different European countries and Canada.When it came to alcohol consumption, Irish 13-year-olds ranked among the least likely to say they had tried alcohol before, 39th out of 45 countries. Greece topped the table, followed by Wales, France and then England. Similarly, Irish 15-year-olds surveyed ranked below the average.Irish teens and tweens were also among the least likely to state they had smoked tobacco before – 11-year-olds were third from the bottom out of 42 other countries, 13-year-olds were fifth from the bottom, and 15-year-olds were eight from the bottom of the table.The Irish component of the study, published on Tuesday, was led by Prof Saoirse Nic Gabhainn in NUI Galway’s Health Promotion Research Centre.CannabisIreland ranked in the middle of the table when it came to 15-year-olds who had smoked cannabis before, with Bulgaria at the top.The survey shows Irish teenagers rank high for problematic social media use compared to other countries. Problematic use of social media relates to an over-reliance on platforms, or where the young person felt unhappy when they were not online, or if their social media use created other problems in their life such as family disputes.Irish 13-year-olds were the fifth highest in the survey of European countries to report problematic social media use. And they also experienced higher than average cyberbullying, with both teenage groups ranking 10th in the table when it came to having been cyberbullied in recent months. Girls were more likely than boys to have experienced online abuse.Irish 15-year-olds were less likely to report having had sex, ranking 32nd out of 43 countries.In terms of diet, Irish adolescents were among the most likely to eat breakfast and reported low levels of sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, compared to peers in other countries. And Irish 11-year-olds surveyed also reported the third-highest levels of moderate or vigorous physical activity.Prof Nic Gabhainn said the higher levels of problematic social media use and cyberbullying among Irish teenagers was one area of “concern”.“It is positive to note we retain comparatively low rates of substance use and high rates of physical activity,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine first human trial shows signs creating immunity","story":"The first coronavirus vaccine tested on humans appears safe and generated antibodies which stopped the virus replicating, according to early trial results shared on Monday. Eight healthy volunteers saw few adverse effects after taking two doses of the potential vaccine, according to Moderna, its manufacturer based in Massachusetts. It appeared to trigger an immune response - the critical requirement of a working vaccine - producing neutralising antibodies in all eight of the patients. The levels of those antibodies were similar to that found in people who caught Covid-19 and then recovered. Dr Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, called the result a “first important step”, with much more testing needed. Some medical experts urged caution, seeking more data. A second phase of trials with around 600 people will begin soon, while a third involving thousands of people will start in July. Moderna\u0027s stock price was up 40 per cent in pre-market trading as the results emerged.  The positive news is only one step in the long road to a potential vaccine.Even if the coming trials are successful Moderna\u0027s vaccine would not be available until between January and June 2021. However, given there is some doubt that a vaccine can even be found, the results provide hope that a breakthrough can be achieved. US stock markets surged in early trading as the news emerged, with the Dow Jones industrial average initially up 3.5 per cent.Currently there is no proven treatment or vaccine for Covid-19. Dozens of companies across the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine. Three different doses of the potential vaccine were trialled by Moderna. The positive results were found in those who tried the low and medium doses. Only one participant who took these doses had any adverse reaction, a redness around the point of injection on the arm which eventually cleared.People who took the high dose saw more adverse reactions, including fever and headaches. The higher dose is expected to be eliminated from future trials. The company also announced that when the vaccine, called mRNA-1273, was given to mice who were then exposed to coronavirus the virus would not multiply in their lungs. Stephane Bancel, chief executive of Moderna, told The Washington Post: “We are very, very happy because first the vaccine was generally safe.Peter Jay Hotez, who is developing a coronavirus vaccine at the Baylor College of Medicine, told the paper that it would be important to see the exact level of antibodies produced in each participant. When Moderna\u0027s trial started in March it was believed to be the first time a potential coronavirus vaccine had been tested on humans. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gary lineker apologises ex footballer became running joke bbc","story":"Gary Lineker has apologised to a former Premier League footballer who described how repeated jokes about him on BBC show They Think It\u0027s All Over negatively affected his mental health.Luke Chadwick said he had grown to dread the sports-based quiz programme, which featured Lineker as a team captain for eight years, after he was targeted by panellists following his debut for Manchester United as a teenager.Speaking to the BBC at the start of Mental Health Awareness Week, Chadwick, 39, said the show had magnified attention on him at a time when he was receiving abuse over his personal appearance.He said: I became a picture of fun, and that was probably the hardest thing.I used to dread it coming on the telly. I wouldn\u0027t watch it but then I\u0027d get a text off someone saying \u0027oh you\u0027ve been on that show again\u0027 as if it was a joke.Obviously people were finding it funny, but it was eating away at me a bit inside while that was happening.Former host Nick Hancock yesterday apologised after admitting Chadwick had become a running joke on the show.The comedian told BBC Breakfast he was full of admiration for the present Luke Chadwick and full of sympathy for the young Luke Chadwick.He said: I\u0027m appalled for him and at myself. Of course the worst thing for Luke was that it became a bit of a running joke.“We should have been thinking about the person, but that\u0027s what can happen.

Twenty countries in total allowed children to take exams in other ways than traditional.Ms Divjak said that ministers around Europe said the reopened schools were not functioning in normal conditions. There was very close cooperation with health ministries, epidemiological services, teachers and parents and classes were much smaller.“What has been emphasised very strongly is that these schools have very guarded conditions like smaller groups than in normal classes, usually groups of around 15,” she said. However, France has had to close about 70 schools where new coronavirus cases were found just a week after they reopened, its education minister said on Monday.Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French education minister, acknowledged that the return has put some children in danger of new contamination, as a debate rages in Britain - and worldwide - over the risks of sending children back to school.However, Mr Blanquer told RTL radio that all schools with Covid-19 cases were being closed immediately. He said keeping children at home was a greater risk than sending them back to the classroom because it risked interfering with their education and social development.“Our children must not be collateral victims of health measures,” Mr Blanquer said. About a third of pupils have returned to some 40,000 primary and nursery schools that reopened in France last week, with a second wave of children resuming classes at secondary schools in some parts of the country this week.The government has allowed parents to keep children at home if they are worried. The discovery of new cases highlights the problems it faces in trying to reassure worried families that it is safe for children to go back to school.Mr Blanquer said the new cases had probably been infected before schools reopened, as the incubation period for the virus is believed to be up to 14 days.“There are always worries and questions, but even so we should not push school to one side in this difficult period, because there will be terrible damage if we lose a generation of children who have been stopped from going to school for several months,” he said.Some parents exhausted by child care while they work from home have welcomed the return to school, but others have chosen not to send their children back until the number of infections decreases further.The government is particularly concerned about children from less privileged backgrounds falling behind because they are less well equipped to follow online classes at home and have less parental help.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one three private sector workers having wages paid state","story":"There are nearly 27.5 million people working in the private sector, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Mr Sunak said: As of the end of last week, eight million people from around a million businesses are covered by this scheme and having their wages paid by the Government to protect their jobs and their future security.On Monday, Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, called for clarity over the future of the scheme and warned that asking employers to start paying part of the subsidy risks a massive spike in job losses.Mr Sunak said: We are in deep consultation with both unions and business groups to make sure we get the design of the second part of this scheme right.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"regional lifting lockdown needed prevent coronavirus flare ups","story":"The Tony Blair Institute has developed a model that compares the mobility of people in different parts of the UK to how fast the virus is spreading in order to work out whether there is room for lifting restrictions.There are some areas where things are fine and lockdown is jeopardising people\u0027s jobs and livelihoods, so there is a case for doing it more regionally and this is a tool that could help that.The data is based on the monitoring of movements of Android users by Google. The team said monitoring these mobility levels in real time could allow different parts of the country to take steps to increase or decrease mobility in their area.But if easing goes too far, the spread of the virus could begin to accelerate again, risking thousands more lives and a potentially more severe second economic shock, the researchers warn.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is considering bringing in different restrictions for inidual regions, and the Government said it is weighing up the idea.Last week, analysis from Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University suggested that the \u0027R\u0027 rate was as low as 0.4 in London but as high as 0.8 in the north-east. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk can learn europes easing lockdown","story":"As Covid-19 began to surge across Europe earlier this year, Boris Johnson issued a clear warning of what was to come.“The numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating,” the Prime Minister told the nation on March 22. “We are only a matter of weeks – two or three – behind Italy.” On Monday, for the first time in two months, Italy finally began to emerge from one of the strictest lockdowns in the world.Italians will once again be allowed to visit museums and restaurants, while some shops will finally reopen. In Spain, officials announced similar restrictions would be lifted in some areas.The news might raise hopes, therefore, that the UK government is poised to do the same, perhaps in two or three weeks\u0027 time. Not so, according to leading scientists, who say this country\u0027s trajectory has fallen further behind our Mediterranean neighbours. Instead, the British public will likely be waiting “much longer” for normal life to return.The reasons are many and complicated, of course. But the main obstacle is this country’s stubbornly-high infection rate, compared to our European neighbours.On March 22, when the Prime Minister issued his warning, confirmed UK cases stood at 5,683, with a death total of 281. Two weeks before, on March 7, Italy had been in a similar situation with 233 deaths and 5,900 cases.Italy hit its peak number of 6,557 Covid-19 cases on March 21, but since then, daily cases have fallen steadily and quickly. Last Sunday, the Italian government announced only 675 new cases, a fall since the peak of nearly 90 per cent.Spain released figures on the same day showing that, from a peak of 8,271 cases on March 26, new infections had fallen to just 1,214, a fall of 85 per cent.Yet in the UK, figures show that from an early peak of 6,199 cases on April 5, the number fell to 3,534 on May 17, a drop of only 43 per cent.In short, the daily number of cases in the UK is falling much more slowly than in Italy and Spain. The UK\u0027s downward curve is far flatter.Professor Azeem Majeed, head of public health at Imperial College London, said the comparatively high infection rate in the UK meant lockdown measures would likely last far longer than in Italy or Spain.However, the UK government would have “the clear advantage” of seeing the effect of relaxing restrictions in other countries before deciding how to act, he added.“It helps to look at what’s happening in Italy and Spain, of course it does,” he said.“In some ways it will be useful to the UK government, because evidence will be coming in from those countries. “But the fact remains that the infection rate in this country is not dropping as fast, and that’s a major problem.“We are now far further than two or three weeks behind, in terms of trajectory.”Experts are split on the reasons why the UK’s number of daily cases remains so stubbornly high.Some leading scientists claim that the Government enforced total lockdown too late, meaning the virus became more deeply embedded, and harder to shift.Italy first began shutting down towns and cities on February 21, before ordering total lockdown on March 9. Spain followed a week later. It was not until March 23 that Boris Johnson finally ordered the British public to stay at home.The terms of the UK lockdown are also fairly lenient, compared to measures taken elsewhere in Europe. In Spain, people were banned for seven weeks from leaving their homes even to exercise, while in Italy the carabinieri patrolled the streets, arresting or fining anyone outside without good reason.Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior consultant in communicable disease control, claimed the UK would now “pay the price” for delaying lockdown too long.“The later you lock down, the longer it takes to get out of it,” he said.“It’s not surprising that we are plateauing, compared to those countries. We should have shut down much earlier, and had a testing and contact tracing in place to prevent the virus spreading.“We didn’t do that, and now we pay the price.“At the start of the epidemic we were said to be roughly three weeks behind the other countries, in terms of transmission. When it comes to leaving lockdown, I’m afraid we are now far further behind.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk employment furlough workers covid 19 ons","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Unemployment increased by 50,000 to 1.35 million in the first three months of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic had a “major impact” on the UK labour market, official figures have shown.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found work hours also fell sharply in late March, when the UK’s lockdown began, and warned figures for April showed signs of a further fall in employment.“While only covering the first weeks of restrictions, our figures show Covid-19 is having a major impact on the labour market,” Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In March employment held up well, as furloughed workers still count as employed, but hours worked fell sharply in late March, especially in sectors such as hospitality and construction.“Through April, though, there were signs of falling employment as real-time tax data show the number of employees on companies\u0027 payrolls fell noticeably, and vacancies were sharply down too, with hospitality again falling steepest.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The source also mentioned halting the purchase of Boeing aeroplanes.On Friday, the Trump administration renewed its executive order banning for another year, which bans American businesses from working with companies that pose a national security risk such as telecom equipment manufacturer ZTE and the smartphone maker Huawei. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it is a security risk.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe impact of the renewed ban is already shaping industry: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has reportedly stopped new orders from Huawei.TSMC is the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and a key Huawei supplier, and had announced plans to build a US-based plant and was “following the U.S. export rule change closely”. The company has denied this, saying it does not disclose order details and added the report was “purely market rumour.”UK Huawei go-ahead sparks diplomatic row with AustraliaAlthough Huawei declined to make a statement when the extended ban was announced, the company has since said: “In its relentless pursuit to tighten its stranglehold on our company, the US government has decided to proceed and completely ignore the concerns of many companies and industry associations.”“This decision was arbitrary and pernicious, and threatens to undermine the entire industry worldwide. This new rule will impact the expansion, maintenance, and continuous operations of networks worth hundreds of billions of dollars that we have rolled out in more than 170 countries” the company continued.The most prominent effects of the ban to consumers have been that Google cannot provide Huawei with access to Google Mobile Services and therefore popular apps such as Maps and YouTube are not available on Huawei phones.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanTensions between the world’s two largest economies have spiked in recent weeks, with officials on both sides suggesting a hard-won deal that defused a bitter 18-month trade war could be abandoned months after it was signed in January.The United States “uses state power, under the so-called excuse of national security, and abuses export control measures to continuously oppress and contain specific enterprises of other countries” said an anonymous spokesperson on the Chinese government commerce ministry’s website.Debate has also been sparked in the UK over whether the government should use Huawei’s 5G technology, with some Conservative MPs arguing that Huawei should have a limited role in building the country’s network because of national security concerns. Huawei has called such criticism “groundless.”Additional reporting by Reuters Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Schools have been told to prepare for early year settings, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to the classroom in smaller sizes from the start of next month, and to start reintroducing more face-to-face lessons for Year 10 and Year 12 students. All primary school students would also be back in school for a month before summer under the government’s goal – advice one headteachers union has told its members to ignore as it is not “realistic”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent spoke to Steve Chalke, the founder of the Oasis trust – an academy trust with around 50 schools in England – and Alex Rawlings, the headteacher of Quarry Bank Primary School in the West Midlands, about their differing views on plans to get children back to school as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic. 1. Are you planning on reopening your school(s) on 1 June? Do you support these plans?Steve Chalke: “Yes. But it is an important thing to say that some won’t be reopening at all, because they never shut. I think that has been lost in this conversation. Many of our schools have stayed open throughout to care for and work with the children of key workers and those who are most vulnerable. What we will be doing on 1 June is scaling up what we are doing. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“Our plan at one school is different for the plans for each of the other schools. We have 35 primaries. The reason they are different is because we have 35 different buildings. Some are bigger, some are smaller, some have wider corridors, some have narrower corridors, and they have different size classrooms, for example. “We are supportive of the government plans to open schools on June 1 because we are ready. Oasis is having a conversation in each locality with its school leaders, its parents, its community. We are talking with the unions and the government and that is why we are going to open on 1 June.”Alex Rawlings: “We are planning on a phased return of school on 2 June. We will be using 1 June to prepare the classrooms and school site. Our children in early years will start on 2 June followed by our year 1 and year 6 children on 8 June. We will remain open for our key worker and vulnerable children.“I wholeheartedly support the return to school for children, but only when we know it is safe.“The government has not done enough to convince a lot of parents nor school leaders that it is safe to return.”2.

Instead of having children in all day, we are having a cohort in the morning, and a different cohort in in the afternoon ... There is a gap when we can cleanse everything, clean it down, wipe everything. “Some schools will have fewer children in a classroom than others. The government has said you can have up to 15 in a classroom. Depending on the sizes of our classrooms, we are deciding how many children can go in them.“We have ordered and have got PPE equipment ... Any staff member or any child that wants PPE, it is there for them.“The way Oasis is geared up is there is a central team that supports all our schools. Some of this work, like ordering of PPE, has been done centrally so we can make sure all our schools have got that. We prepared a whole list of questions for our schools to ask themselves as they get ready.“We have done a full risk assessment of each inidual schools, so we have had a meeting for all 35 schools ... and we worked out the bespoke plan for each of the schools in that meeting.” Alex Rawlings: “I’m currently putting together plans to return as safely as we can. Some of those plans include additional hand washing stations, spacing of tables and chairs in classrooms, purchasing lidded bins so that waste can be disposed of according to the governments guidance, and buying coloured wristbands so groups of children can identify themselves from other groups and keep their distance.“It is however incredibly hard to plan for the reopening of school when the guidance changes on a daily basis. Boris Johnson originally said only reception, year 1 and year 6 children were to return, then the guidance made reference to nursery and even now government officials neglect to mention nursery children returning also.“Schools had invested significant resources to planning a return that made sense to them and their communities. The government also released a document on Friday night explaining that schools should avoid using rota systems to accommodate children. Hundreds of schools would have been back to square one of planning, with only two weeks, including half-term, until schools are expected to open to those year groups.”3. What are the main difficulties schools face with regards to opening during coronavirus?Steve Chalke: “You should never do anything you haven’t thought about and carefully planned for. To open without doing the planning we have been able to do is a risk too far.“But then there is another answer. In the end, it isn’t PPE and it isn’t actively planning and risk assessment forms that get you there: it is trust.“The real foundation on which phased return to any school is built is trust. By that I mean, trust between school staff and leaders, and trust between parents and the school. If you have got all that trust going on and good communication, that is the final ingredient you need to open school. If you don’t have trust and a good relationship, it will be really hard because scaremongering breaks out and rumours start flying.”Alex Rawlings: “Inconsistent guidance from government which causes a lack of confidence in reopening and the logistics of following the guidance are hugely limiting.“Gavin Williamson said we were having a tentative start of reopening schools, when actually he has insisted that four out of eight year groups attend school. Those classes are halved, which requires double the space and double the supervision, which means that schools have to be at 100 per cent staffing capacity to safely open. With lots of adults shielding or self-isolating, schools do not have the staffing capacity to reopen – we will only just be able to, hopefully.“The most difficult aspect to sort is to try to increase parental confidence in school’s ability to keep everyone safe. Everyone knows it is going to be impossible to keep 3 and 4-year-olds apart at a distance of two metres. In every workplace in the country you are to socially distance unless you have adequate PPE. Schools have been told that social distancing isn’t attainable whilst working with children and that it isn’t recommended that schools use PPE routinely.“Adults will never have confidence in government plans to reopen until they can tell everyone what makes a school classroom uniquely safe when compared to any other workspace in the entire United Kingdom.”4. What are the benefits of getting children back in the classroom, as opposed to home learning?Steve Chalke: “I think they are huge. A report done for the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown a massive gap between the rich and the poor in the amount of homework study being done. It said the more middle class you are or wealthy you are, the more digital access you have, more laptops and and the more time parents have got to spend with you ... But it is much worse than what they are saying.They are saying across this period, wealthy children will have done seven days more work by the end of this than others. I think this is woefully underestimated. All our schools are in poor communities, some of our kids haven’t been receiving dinners as government system has failed all together.“Why do we need to get these schools open? For learning to continue. Around four million children in England live in poverty. The children commissioners office say two million live in homes where there is domestic abuse, where there is parental substance misuse or parental mental health issues. All of those figures come before lockdown. How do you think those figures have gone up? The longer these children wait for a return to school, the greater the negative impact on their learning, their health and on their safety.”Alex Rawlings: “The benefits to getting children back are clear – children will receive improved education provision and they will see their friends, which is really important.“Parents have worked incredibly hard with their children at home but it is very difficult to turn a dining room in to a classroom and it is obviously not as successful as being in a classroom environment.”5. What are your concerns (if any) about the plans to reopen on 1 June?Steve Chalke: “Where the type of things we have been talking about haven’t been done, I would be very wary of opening a school. But I think there are still two weeks to go.“My advice is to a school that is on its own, that don’t feel they have got the support they need, I think I would really happy to provide people with an understanding of the kind of approach we have adopted.”I’ve been a teacher for 23 years – re-opening schools is dangerousAlex Rawlings: ”Children are being used as guinea pigs.“The government are trying to push a narrative that if you care for children then you will promote the reopening of schools. Every member of our school staff cares deeply for the children in their care and want nothing more for them to return, but only when it is safe to do so.“There has not been enough time, clear guidance or scientific evidence to suggest that it is the right time to do so.“Everyone keeps referring to the Danish model and how that has worked. It is a ridiculous comparison. Denmark’s deaths are in the hundreds, ours are in the tens of thousands. Denmark were one of the first countries to close its schools (we were one of the last) and they returned when only a few hundred people were in intensive care being treated for coronavirus, we have thousands.”6.  Do you feel the science is clear enough to show schools are safe to reopen on 1 June?Steve Chalke: “Yes. I think the problem is the unions and all the people commentating on this aren’t the scientists. So what we have tried to do throughout the whole process has really talk to people who are in the middle of the science. I heard Brian Cox say – and I agree with this totally – anyone who tell you they are following the science doesn’t understand science. Science is a debate.”Alex Rawlings: “On Friday night, the government released the science that was supposed to convince schools that it was safe to open. This document contains no science, just a regurgitation of their own guidance.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being back with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing.“Plans for a phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, are based on the best scientific and medical advice. The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making.”They added: “We have engaged closely with the unions throughout the past eight weeks, including organising for them to hear directly from the scientific experts last week, and will continue to do so, including to develop further guidance if required.”Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anyone with this symptom should isolate for seven days while other household members should isolate for 14 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdding anosmia to the list of symptoms could be a crucial move as the government looks to set up a test, track and isolate system to control the virus after lockdown restrictions are lifted.But officials have faced criticism that the addition of loss of smell has come too late.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Professor Tim Spector, head of the department of genetic epidemiology and leader of the Covid symptom study app at King’s College London, told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that 17 other countries including the US had altered their list of symptoms beyond a cough and fever.While the KCL app uses self-reported symptoms that are not verified, Prof Spector said using its data he estimated between 50,000 to 70,000 people in the UK with Covid-19 were not being told to self-isolate because their symptoms did not match the official definition.He said: “We list about 14 symptoms which we know are related to having a positive swab test, and these are not being picked up by the NHS.”The loss of smell and taste has been repeatedly reported as a symptom of Covid-19. Health minister Nadine Dorries reported losing 100 per cent of her taste and smell when she contracted the virus in March.Last week, the British Rhinological Society and ENT UK criticised the government for being slow to act. In a joint statement, the two bodies said they had warned eight weeks ago that anosmia was linked to Covid-19, adding that there was now “overwhelming evidence” it was a main symptom and accused the NHS and health officials of “clinical negligence” for not adding anosmia to the official list of symptoms.Carl Philpott, professor of rhinology and olfactology at Norwich Medical School, said: “The announcement that the chief medical officers have now recognised smell and taste disturbances is extremely welcome, albeit much later than other European counterparts and at least two weeks after the WHO added it to their list. This will hopefully now be another measure by which the pandemic can be contained, especially as in some people it may be the only symptom or may precede other symptoms.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“This is particularly pertinent in healthcare workers where reports of smell and taste disturbances have been commonplace, meaning the transfer of infection from colleagues to each other and to uninfected patients will have been happening unchecked. There will also be a recognition that although many patients will recover these senses, the need for ongoing support will be faced by a minority in whom these sensory losses persist.”Briefing journalists this morning, deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam said the government’s scientific advisers on its new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, or Nervtag, had carried out a “granular” assessment of Public Health England’s database of the first few hundred Covid-19 cases.He said: “The reason for making the change now is that there has been a signal around possibly the importance of the anosmia as a symptom of Covid-19 for a while now. It’s been important to continue to look at that. And be sure that we consider it, and introduce it at the right time, when we think it’s going to make a difference moving forward, to how we pick up cases.“We do know of some cases where it appears early, but in many cases, it does not appear early.”Why are loss of smell and taste symptoms of coronavirus?He added: “The question for Nervtag has always been at what point can we be sure that by adding anosmia, or anything else, such fatigue, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, definitely improve and help us to pick up cases. That work has now been completed and that’s why we’ve got to the position we have now. It’s not just about whether or not anosmia exists. It’s about what role it plays in identifying cases, and that’s taken time to work through those data.”He said while anosmia could last for many weeks, no one would need to isolate longer than the official advice of seven days.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This results in extra cosmic rays entering the solar system.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNeutron counts from the University of Oulu\u0027s Sodankyla Geophysical Observatory show that cosmic rays reaching Earth in 2020 are near a Space Age peak” wrote Dr. Tony Phillips on his website. “So far this year, the sun has been blank 76 per cent of the time, a rate surpassed only once before in the Space Age. Last year, 2019, the sun was blank 77 per cent of the time. Two consecutive years of record-setting spotlessness adds up to a very deep Solar Minimum” Phillips also wrote, while suggesting that “excess cosmic rays...affect the electro-chemistry of Earth’s upper atmosphere and may help trigger lightning.”Astronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsSome have speculated that the lowered output from the sun could result in a “Little Ice Age”, similar to the one that occurred between the 14th and 19th century and happened concurrently with mountain glacier expansion in the European Alps, New Zealand, and Alaska among other locations, and lower temperatures across the northern hemisphere.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

This can pose an increased threat to astronauts travelling through space” Pesnell says.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Sage absolutely is a committee that advises the whole of the nation in that sense.”Foreign secretary Dominic Raab insisted that we’ve actually had a UK-wide approach, adding: Equally we’ve recognised that, given the devolved competences and the level of coronavirus in different parts of the UK, there may be different speeds at which the different nations proceed, or even at regional level.Northern Ireland\u0027s official coronavirus death toll currently sits at 482, with fewer than 5,000 confirmed cases.

Its 48 coaches run a range of sports programmes, including basketball, tennis, table tennis, volleyball and yoga.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLuca Toth, a head coach at the charity, taught volleyball at the Central Foundation Girls’ School in Tower Hamlets. She tells The Independent: “I see sports coaching as a tool to get close to the girls and be a mentor figure. We teach them teamwork, to persevere and to handle disappointment.”Some 67 per cent of the young people Greenhouse mentors live in postcodes classed as “deprived”. Just north of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in Marylebone lies Church Street Ward, one of the most deprived wards nationally. Figures from 2017 suggest more than half of children in the area live in poverty.How to support our campaignA spokesperson for Greenhouse tells The Independent: “Lockdown came in and suddenly kids were completely cut off. One child could have had a breakfast club, a lunch club, a PE session and an afternoon sports session with us. A lot of the kids are going back to home lives that are very difficult, in confined spaces.”Some children that it mentors come from families where sport is not seen as a cultural priority. Others do not speak English at home. “The Joe Wicks PE experience might not actually cut through to them.”Joel Archard, a father of three, calls Greenhouse “a beacon of the community” over the phone with The Independent. His daughter Luna, now 12 years old, plays table tennis with Maria, another coach and mentor. “They didn’t let the lockdown stop them. They do zoom calls, and ask ‘how are you doing?’. It gives the kids a bit of structure to their lives.Greenhouse is also preparing for the end of lockdown. “Everything is pointing to the fact that the recession will hit the kind of families we deal with hardest, especially young people who have missed school,” says a spokesperson.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It now delivers close to 100 food packages a day.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project and former COO of Greenhouse Sports, says: “The Felix Project is proud to have worked closely with Greenhouse Sports for many years. During this health crisis it’s great to see them open up their amazing sports centre at the heart of the local community. We applaud their innovation.”Help The Hungry campaign to feed vulnerable Londoners raises over £4mVolunteers cook for neighbours struggling without food during crisisMarathons and piggy-back challenges help The Independent raise £3.7mTwo other organisations that have innovated to support our campaign under lockdown are Holland \u0026amp Barrett and Daylesford Organic. Holland \u0026amp Barrett, a regular supplier of The Felix Project, has donated 2,000 units of vitamin D for elderly people stuck at home at risk of deficiency.Daylesford Organic has released a range of fermented vegetables with Felix Project branding. The farm shop offers “ferments” of radish and butternut squash as “unusual” garnishes for meals or cocktails. It expects to raise an additional £10,000 per year, and all profits from the products go to the charity.Luca, the volleyball coach from Greenhouse, expresses her concern about her children’s welfare through this crisis. “There is probably no privacy for many of the kids sharing rooms. I’m worried that the ones who were ok when we left will suffer, and those who weren’t ok at the beginning will come back worse.“We are dealing with so many people who need us. I have seen what a change we have made in these people’s lives.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Richard Smith, supply manager of The Felix Project, said they had “really stepped up to the plate”.How to support our campaign“Some companies have hugely increased their supplies to us,” he said. “Innocent normally give us five pallets a week but this week we took 24 pallets off them. Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years. So well done, but the hard part comes now. ”Here, 11 of Felix’s most prolific suppliers (in addition to Ocado) explain why they have chosen to partner with Felix, London’s biggest food surplus distributor.Felix suppliers and their generous food donations in April:The firm which produces online recipe boxes has donated 39 tons. Laurent Guillemain, its CEO, said: “We are proud to partner with Felix during the most extraordinary of times. Helping to care for our communities and the vulnerable is more important than ever and we will continue to support this incredible initiative that helps redistribute surplus food however we can.”A dairy products company which contributed 17 tons. The managing director of Müller Yogurt and Desserts, Bergen Merey, said: “Over three years ago I committed to this genuine cause, having read the story of young Felix. With a 14-year-old son of my own, I felt inspired by this wonderful initiative in his memory.”The restaurant and hotel supplier gave 12 tons. Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London. We are proud to make a commitment to Felix as well as to supply high quality food stocks and fresh ingredients so that vulnerable families, elderly people and our amazing NHS workers know there is a nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of the day.”The company which produces smoothies has donated 11 tons. Its head of refreshment marketing, Suraj Gangani, said: “We’re proud to have supported Felix in getting our healthy drinks to those who’ve needed them through this tough time.”The craft organic bakery gave 10 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We decided to change the way we approached food waste and engage with just one organisation, The Felix Project. They are an inspiration. We appreciate that the work of Felix will become more critical and widespread now and for the foreseeable future.”A meat supply company that gave 9 tons. Tim Woodward, CEO, said: “We are delighted to work closely with Felix. Since we started working with them we have delivered over 32,000 meals and 6,200kg of meat for cooking.”The company behind restaurants including The Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott’s and Sexy Fish contributed 8 tons. Richard Caring, its founder, said: “During these difficult times we must come together. The fantastic volunteers from Caprice Holdings restaurants and The Ivy Collections have been cooking 20,000 meals a week to supply, in partnership with Felix, some of London’s vulnerable communities. Together we can make a difference.”An online fruit and veg box company which gave 7 tons. Its co-founders, Emilie Vanpoperinghe and Deepak Ravindran, said: “We rescue odd and surplus fruit and veg directly from farms. Working with Felix means we can prevent delicious food from going to waste.”The catering suppliers donated 7 tons. Sarah Reynolds, its head of corporate and social responsibility, said: “We have partnered with Felix for some years. Together with many of our customers, we have been able to ert surplus food to those who need it most. We are very proud of this relationship.”The supermarket and clothing retailer gave 6 tons. Ryan Kerr, head of M\u0026ampS’s north London region, said: “Through our partnership with community platform Neighbourly, our northwest London stores have donated 3,200 meals to Felix since the start of March to support those who need it most in these communities.”The supermarket gave 9 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We have proudly been working with Felix since 2016.

I think you can see why there\u0027s concern in the scientific community over the, \u0027we are following the science message\u0027.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s always, always, always in any loosening of these restrictions a risk of people catching the coronavirus.”“The key thing is that we can make these workplaces safe. You can never eliminate risk, but as we know, it is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak and if, for any reason, there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them.”Mr Gove urged councils, teaching unions and doctors to “think again” about opposition to reopening primary school classrooms in England from 1 June, as proposed by the government, telling them that if they really care about children they should look to their responsibilities.Medics turn their backs in protest at Belgian PM’s handling of virusLabour is pressing the government to publish the scientific evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools, and to keep talking to unions, teachers and councils to ensure parents can be confident their children will be safe if they return.Rachel Reeves, shadow Cabinet Office minister, told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The government have got a lot more work to do to give that confidence that it will be safe to send children back in two weeks’ time.“The government have got two weeks to get this right. They haven’t approached this in the right way so far.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But Mr Hancock faced criticism over the test-and-trace system as he refused to set a date for the programme to start – after Downing Street said the next stage of lockdown-easing could begin without it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are also fears that the expansion of the testing policy will mean greater demand on key chemicals that laboratories say are already in short supply.Mr Hancock told the House of Commons: “Every day we are creating more capacity and that means more people can be tested, and the virus has fewer places to hide.“Today, I can announce to the house that everyone aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test. That applies right across the UK in all four nations from now.“Anyone with a new continuous cough, a high temperature or the loss or change of sense of taste or smell can book a test by visiting nhs.ukcoronavirus.”Mr Hancock claimed his benchmark of 100,000 Covid-19 tests had been hit on Sunday, although this includes tens of thousands “in the post” and not yet administered.From a tiny number of tests at the start of the pandemic in March, the UK’s programme had been “scaled at breathtaking pace into a global champion”, he claimed.But Allan Wilson, president of the Institute for Biomedical Scientists, which represents NHS laboratory staff, said the announcement on testing expansion was “more of the same” from the government, with what he described as “reactive” announcements and creating new targets rather than concentrating on a full testing strategy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Are we prioritising anyone over the age of five, key workers or on a first-come-first-served basis?”Mr Wilson said the announcement would increase pressure on the government’s Lighthouse Laboratories, which carry out the coronavirus testing, rather than the NHS. But he added: “We are still competing with them for the same reagents for the test. The supply chain is still very hand-to-mouth.“The Lighthouse Labs don’t seem to be able to get much above the 100,000 tests a day and it’s not clear where this extra capacity is coming from.”In recent days there have been problems with testing and data from the commercial labs being made available to local health officials.Mr Hancock also came under pressure over how long it takes for test results to come back, ducking a question from Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health spokesperson, asking for the average wait for returns from the private firms running the drive-through facilities.Mr Hancock also strongly denied delays of 96 hours – when Rushanara Ali, a Labour backbencher, warned it would put people “at risk” – but was unable to give an alternative figure.The health secretary said there were now 21,000 contact tracers in England – including “7,500 health care professionals” to help the call handlers, more than the 3,000 originally suggested.“They will help manually trace the contacts of anyone who’s had a positive test and advise them on whether they need to isolate. They have rigorous training,” he said.France sees 70 Covid-19 cases linked to schools days after reopeningJudge Rinder accuses government of ‘negligent’ coronavirus adviceCoronavirus quarantine for UK arrivals delayed until JuneLoss of smell and taste now officially a coronavirus symptomEarlier, Boris Johnson’s spokesperson, when asked when tracing would be fully operational, said only that this would happen “in the coming weeks”.Jonathan Ashworth demanded a date for it starting – and details for how people in contact with carriers would isolate – but Mr Hancock swerved both questions.And Mr Hancock again dismissed growing criticism that care home residents were put at risk after patients were moved there from hospitals without being tested, helping to explain the high deaths rate there.“There has been no large-scale removal of people from hospitals into care homes, as has been implied by some,” he told MPs. “Those movements have been done with care.”And on care homes he again played down that 38 per cent have suffered Covid-19 cases, saying: “The majority of care homes have not had outbreak at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpeaking during the second reading of the Bill, Ms Nokes, a former immigration minister, said: “We must turn off free movement, there is no doubt about that. We must uphold the outcome of the 2016 referendum as the home secretary so rightly pointed out. “But I would argue we must do it with caution, and perhaps a phased approach might give us more flexibility.”Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message projected onto the White Cliffs of DoverBig Ben, shows the hands at eleven o\u0027clock at nightNigel Farage speaks to pro-Brexit supportersPro-Brexit demonstrators celebrate on Parliament Square The Union flag is taken down outside the European Parliament in BrusselsPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA pro-Brexit supporter jumps on an EU flag in Parliament SquareEU Council staff removed the Union Jack-British flag from the European Council in Brussels, BelgiumPedestrians pass in front of the Ministry of Defence Building on Whitehall, illuminated by red, white and blue lights in central London A Brexit supporter shouts during a rally in LondonPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghPro-EU campaigners take part in a \u0027Missing EU Already\u0027 rally outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA large pro-EU banner is projected onto Ramsgate cliff in KentPro-EU supporters light candles in Smith Square in WestminsterA man waves Union flags from a small car as he drives past Brexit supporters gathering in Parliament SquareThe five-year old Elisa Saemann, left, and her seven-year old sister Katie hold a placard during a rally by anti-Brexit protesters outside the Scottish parliament in EdinburghPro Europe supporters gather on Brexit day near the British embassy in Berlin, GermanyAnti-Brexit protester hugs a man while holding a placard A decorated, old fashioned fire pump in Parliament SquarePro Brexit Elvis impersonator performs at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexiteers stands with his dog in Parliament SquarePaddy from Bournemouth wears Union colours as he sits next to an EU flag decorated bag in Parliament Square A pro-EU activist plays a guitar decorated with the EU flag during a protest organised by civil rights group New Europeans outside Europe House, central LondonPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA Pro Brexit supporter has a Union Jack painted onto his face at Parliament SquareMen hold placards celebrating Britain leaving the EUPro Brexit supporters dance in the street draped with Union Jack flags at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexit demonstrator spreads his wings during a gathering near Downing StreetPro EU supporters display a banner \u0027 Here to Stay, Here to Fight, Migrants In, Tories Out\u0027 from Westminster bridgePro-Brexit supporters burn European Union flags at Parliament SquareA man poses for a picture on Parliament Square in a \u0027Brexit Day\u0027 t-shirtPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA man wears a pro-Brexit t-shirtAnti-Brexit demonstrators visit Europe House to give flowers to the staff on Brexit dayPro Brexit supporter wears a novelty Union Jack top hat outside the Houses of ParliamentCustomers Scott Jones and Laura Jones at the Sawmill Bar in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, where a Brexit party is being held throughout the dayA Brexit supports holds a sign in Parliament SquareA man carries an EU themed wreathAnn Widdecombe reacts with other members of the Brexit party as they leave en masse from the European ParliamentAnti-Brexit demonstrators in Parliament SquarePro EU supporters let off flares from Westminster BridgeBritish MEPs Jonathan Bullock, holding the Union Jack flag and Jake Pugh leave the European Parliament, in Brussels on the Brexit dayNewspapers and other souvenirs at a store, near Parliament SquareBrexit supporters hold signs in Parliament SquarePro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald with a Border Communities Against Brexit poster before its unveiling in Carrickcarnon on the Irish borderNational growers organisation British Apples \u0026amp Pears has renamed a British apple to EOS, the Greek goddess of dawn, to commemorate Brexit dayPro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareBritain\u0027s departure from the European Union was set in law on January 29, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc\u0027s parliament voted to ratify the orce papers.

I commend the home secretary for her commitment to extend visas for doctors and nurses, but what of care workers – are they to be the Cinderella service, forgotten once again?“And what of ancillary staff in our hospitals, so crucial in a war against a virus when repeated deep cleaning is an absolute imperative? We cannot open hospitals if we cannot clean the loos.”Diane Abbott, the former shadow home secretary, also said the Bill is “bad in principle, bad in practice” and described it as a “slap in the face for the thousands of migrants, including EU migrants, working so hard for the NHS and care sector in this time of Covid crisis”.Earlier, Priti Patel said ending free movement will create a “firmer, fairer and simpler system” that will play a “vital role” in the country’s recovery from coronavirus.“The Bill before us today will play a vital role in our recovery plans for the future,” she said. “It will end free movement and pave the way for our new points-based immigration system.“A firmer, fairer and simpler system that will attract the people we need to drive our country forward through the recovery stage of coronavirus laying the foundation for a high wage, high skill, productive economy.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A July 2019 progress report published a year later said a formal consultation was on the way, but none has yet materialised.Gay conversion therapy may be banned in nine countriesFarage defends \u0027gay conversion\u0027 remarks from Brexit Party\u0027s WiddecombeMay vows to eradicate gay conversion therapy in LGBT+ planMs Badenoch suggested on Monday that there were no immediate proposals to change the law and made no mention of the promised consultation.Conversion therapy is a very complex issue, Ms Badenoch said in a written parliamentary written answer replying to a question about plans for legislation.There are a wide range of practices which may fall within its scope and we want to ensure we have a thorough understanding of the situation in the UK to inform an effective approach. Before any decision is made on proposals for ending conversion therapy we must understand the problem, the range of options available and the impact they would have. We will work to deepen our understanding and consider all options for ending the practice of conversion therapy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Laura Russell, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall told The Independent: Any form of ‘therapy’ that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity is unethical and wrong. These so-called conversion therapies have been condemned by all major UK health organisations as they try to shame a person into denying a core part of who they are, and this can have a seriously harmful impact on their mental health and wellbeing. The National LGBT Government survey found that 2 per cent of LGBT people have undergone conversion therapy, and a further 5 per cent have been offered it. We’d urge the Government to remain committed to take the steps they can to end this harmful practice.Created with Sketch.Top 25 LGBT moments in pop culture since Stonewall Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A song about a young gay man leaving home, accompanied by a video which shows desire, persecution, rejection and ultimate freedom, Jimmy Somerville’s anthem epitomised the experience of generations of gay men.Singer Dana International provided another big moment of visibility for transgender people when she won the competition for Israel with her song “Diva”.325 23.

Launching the review, the sponsor body said: “It was always envisaged that when the sponsor body was set up in law, and the delivery body established, certain aspects of the programme would be reviewed.“But given the completely altered political and economic landscape, the review will need to be both deeper and more wide-ranging.”Sarah Johnson, the sponsor body CEO, said: “The restoration and renewal of the Houses of Parliament will be the biggest and most complex heritage project ever undertaken in the UK, protecting one of the world’s most recognisable buildings and likely to support thousands of jobs across the country.“The Sponsor Body has been set up to ensure that the project is delivered in the most efficient way that delivers value for money. It is entirely appropriate that we should pause at this time to consider the validity of recommendations made over five years ago before either the Sponsor Body or the Delivery Authority was formed.“The impact of the current health crisis on public finances and Parliament’s ways of working has made it even more essential that we review both the strategy for relocating the two Houses ad the scope of the restoration of the Palace.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We should have testing going on all over this country so that when we reopen the economy, workers understand that they\u0027re working in a safe environment.Instead, you have got 50 states going it alone because we don\u0027t have that national protocol based on science.The White House\u0027s reopening guidelines for the US\u0027s 50 states to follow was created through the input of its coronavirus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr Anthony Fauci.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastMr Sanders said that the $3 trillion coronavirus relief package passed by House Democrats needed improvements, and urged Congress to add a paycheck security process to circumvent corporate interests.He continued that the pandemic should make the country start rethinking some fundamental tenants of our society, like whether health care is a human right or a benefit.But you know Trump will blame everybody and everything instead of dealing with the crisis that we face and the crisis that we face is reopening the economy safely based on science, not 50 states doing it alone, he said.The crisis we face is that Congress has got to act now to address the enormous suffering and unemployment that is currently existing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result, researchers have ruled out the use of this dose in later trials. One person who received the middle dose experience more severe side effects, but all of the symptoms were temporary and resolved themselves on their own, the statement said.In light of the findings the company has said the experimental vaccine is thought to be “generally safe and well-tolerated”.The next phase of the trial, which will see the company will administer the vaccine to 600 patients, is set to begin shortly.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The move initially spelled relief: the end of homeschooling for many hundreds of thousands of exhausted French parents, many of whom were also working from home.But French education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer sounded the alarm on Monday, telling French radio RTL that the return has put some children in new danger of contamination. He said the affected schools are being closed immediately. French media reported that seven schools in northern France were closed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe situation highlights the precarious situation the French government is finding itself in as it seeks both to reassure the public that the country is moving forward past coronavirus and to react prudently to safeguard public health.Mr Blanquer did not specify if the 70 cases of Covid-19 were among students or teachers.Created with Sketch.Europe emerges from lockdowns across the continent Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two elderly

The government has allowed parents to keep children at home.This week France is reopening junior high schools in “green” regions less affected by the virus, which do not include Paris.Although the idea of children being silent “super-spreaders” has been largely debunked in recent analyses, last week France recorded its first death of a child linked to Kawasaki disease, a mysterious inflammatory syndrome that some doctors say could be triggered by Covid-19.The 9-year-old boy in Marseille was one of 125 children in France currently with the syndrome.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s certainly the reason for us setting up this new bio security centre, as I think was outlined when it was announced, so we can monitor the progress of the virus across the country.Andlocalised action is required, it can be taken,there’s a localised outbreak.What the PM was trying to say was this [schools reopening] is conditional on the numbers going in the right direction.He said it would be helpful to avoid dferences across the country but stressed that scientists were discussing the matter with the unions at the moment to get kids back as soon as its safe to do so.But No said they were not aware of any plans for schools to go back at dferent times.Yesterday Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that regional changes were not on the cards at the moment.Mr Sharma added that it was too soon to discuss a phased lting of lockdown by region.Last week the Prime Ministers spokesperson told reporters that in theory, lockdown rules could be eased at dferent paces across England, but did not specy whether schools would be included.Previously it had been suggested that the lockdown could be tightened again in areas where there was a high infection rate, still.At the moment there are also dferent rules in place between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.Rules for seeing one person at a metre distance in an outdoor space only applies in England.And the same goes for unlimited exercise and day trips.Wales and Scotland said they would be not changing any rules yet and wanted to keep people at home for longer.Over the weekend a family trying to drive from England into Wales for a trip were stopped and ordered back home.According to lockdown rules in Wales, people should only leave homeyou have a reasonable excuse to do so.Police in England and Wales have issued over , fines for lockdown breaches during the coronavirus lockdown.Unions and the Government are locked in an ongoing row about whether its safe for kids to go back to school from June  - as Boris has outlined.Fuming union bosses have demanded their members dont engage with plans, and have put in a string of demands that must be met first.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden today refused to rule out taking action against those who refused to get kids back in school.But parents have been promised they will not be punishedthey keep their kids at home.His warning came on the same day academies warned poor kids will lose outthey don’t reopen.Leaders of the trusts from all over Britain warned The Times that the impact of schools remaining closed would be a disaster for the nation’s poorest students.Professor Alan Smithers, Director of Centre for Education and Employment Research at University of Buckingham warned of damage that may last for a generationkids do not go back to school.Writing in the Daily Mail, he said: The future of this countrys children...[is] something which I regret to say is now hanging by a thread.The reality is this:our schools are not swtly reopened, the inequality gap that scars the British education system will become a chasm. The damage inflicted will be, quite literally, beyond repair for a generation of children.It is a truly desperate situation, one made all the more humiliating by the fact that we are now lagging behind Western Europe in seeking to reopen our schools. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" "},{"url":null,"title":"across the country people and businesses are joining forces to help our frontline workers","story":"Working as an intensive care nurse, Professor Louise Rose knows all too well how important it is for critically ill patients to see their families.But, with the risk of infection so high, coronavirus patients are only allowed visitors in very exceptional circumstances.“During Italy’s massive surge of Covid- cases, I was distressed by stories of hospital patients dying without their loved ones,” says Professor Rose, who also lectures in critical care nursing at King’s College Hospital. “As nurses, we do everything we can to let families say goodbye.”Desperate to help UK coronavirus patients and their relatives, Professor Rose teamed up with Dr Joel Meyer, who works in intensive care at Guy’s and St Thomas’ in London, to harness video technology that enables virtual visiting. They secured charitable grants and, after trialling ious apps, settled on aTouchAway, which is secure for hospital situations and enables three-way bedside calls between the patient, family and medical staff.There was just one problem – they needed tablets to run it on. “We had a few at St Thomas’ but they weren’t G,” Dr Meyer says. Step forward BT, which donated  G-enabled tablets to get the ball rolling. So, by mid-April, patients at Guy’s and St Thomas’ were connecting with loved ones using Louise and Joel’s initiative, named Le Lines.Now, just a month on, Le Lines has supplied , tablets to  intensive care unit sites across the UK, enabling , video calls bringing families together.There have been moments of pure joy. “One man regaining speech after coming off a ventilator proposed to his girlfriend,” Dr Meyer smiles.“And seeing patients sedated with a breathing tube in their throat respond to loved ones with a nod or a wink is so encouraging.”Professor Rose adds: “Seeing their loved ones’ faces anchors them back in the world.”There are funny conversations too – a lot of patients chat to their dogs. But, inevitably, there are heart-wrenching moments.“We’ve witnessed the saddest final conversations and goodbyes with the chaplain and prayers,” Dr Meyer says. “But I’ve seen what peace having family present through video calling brings to patients at the end of their lives.”Le Lines also allows medical teams to have face-to-face conversations with families, which is a far more personal way of engaging than over the phone, especially when they have to deliver the worst possible news. As Dr Meyer says: “We can show empathy over a video connection, picking up on emotional cues and body language.”Donations to Le Lines’ JustGiving page pour in, many – touchingly – from recovered patients who found comfort in Le Lines during the most traumatic period of their lives.“It’s an extraordinary example of what can be achieved between industry, charities, academic partners and the NHS,” Dr Meyer says. And BT continues its support, providing G WiFi hubs to intensive care units.When the coronavirus crisis has passed, virtual visiting will remain a brilliant service for families unable to visit loved ones in hospital due to say childcare, distance or cost – literally a leline bringing hope and light into even the darkest of hours.Diane, a grandmother from south London, was distraught when her husband was taken into hospital with Covid- in early April.She says: “The worst moment was the phone call saying his kidneys were failing and he was on a ventilator. I felt helpless, so far away from him. So when doctors told me about Le Lines, I downloaded the aTouchAway app on my iPad – then the hospital team took their tablet to my husband’s bedside. Seeing him on a ventilator for the first time was a shock, but I found comfort in telling him how much I loved him. ‘You’re doing so well,’ I said, and even though the circumstances were strange and scary, I felt close to him.“When, three days after he’d come off the ventilator, he could talk, his first words to me were: ‘I love you’. I cried. It was beautul.“One of the first things I asked him after he came home last week was whether he’d heard my voice when he was fighting for his le on the ventilator. Yes, he said, and it had given him strength.”As the Covid- pandemic began to spread in the UK, it was feared that the demand for ventilators would overwhelm hospitals.With an urgent need to increase capacity, the government turned to the private sector.British defence manufacturer Babcock International was one of those to answer the call. Five days after an email circulated from its head office, staff had a working prototype up and running. An ambitious target was set to design, develop and supply , ventilators, which the company is now firmly on track to meet. It has involved a huge effort, with staff working round the clock and some fine British innovation employing the legendary “Blitz spirit”.“It’s the most dficult challenge we’ve ever faced, but it’s fantastic to be able to provide some support and feel like we’re making a dference,” says Chris Spicer, head of future support for defence systems technology. “We all have relatives in vulnerable groups so it’s been an emotional experience.”Providing facilities management for a new hospital is no small task. But Interserve managed it in just  days.In early April the world-leading UK support services, construction and equipment services company was tasked at short notice with covering everything from maintenance and portering to cleaning and catering, at the temporary Nightingale North West hospital in Manchester’s Central Convention Centre.Former Royal Marine and fireman Steve Francis is site manager on the project. He oversaw a staff of  for the rapid rollout necessary to have the hospital up and running in time for its first patient on April , and to keep everything ticking over since.“It was an amazing experience. Everybody was enjoying their work, there were no complaints about anything,” he says, “We were just cracking on. The emotional side was seeing how quickly it was rolling out. The atmosphere was tremendous. Now we’ve got a great team here working selflessly knowing they’re making a dference.”The overwhelming demand caused by Covid for personal protective equipment has been answered by a number of private businesses.One of those is defence manufacturer BAE Systems, which responded to an urgent plea in March for face visors from local GPs in Barrow-In-Furness, where it has a facility. The company made a prototype in just two days, manufactured the order using D printers and delivered them direct to the surgeries.When it saw demand was increasing nationwide, BAE then stepped up production at its other UK sites and has now made and distributed , masks. It has also D printed a new invention, the Door Claw, which allows staff in care homes and other places to avoid touching door handles.“It’s amazing how many people were prepared to work really long hours to make things happen,” says technology director Dave Short. “And we’ve had a huge amount of feedback ranging from letters and photographs to videos – quite emotional responses, and that just drives everyone on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a greater risk there than there is marking kids’ work.”Ministers will make their final decision on whether to gradually reopen schools as planned on June  when they assess the lockdown next Thursday.The Sun understands schools in parts of England could be allowed to delay their reopening — but onlycoronavirus rates of infection have shot up locally.But four unions — the NEU, GMB, Unison and Unite — have ramped up their opposition.Their -step document tells union reps they should only agree to schools reopening more fullyevery demand is met.And they warn that evenevery single concern is dealt with, they still expect to oppose plans to gradually reopen schools from June .The document states: “It seems extremely unlikely at present that circumstances nationally will permit that.”They demand that teachers are allowed to wear masks and PPE — even though Public Health England says this would usually not be needed.And entire schools should closestaffing levels drop, the document says.SCHOOLKIDS are heaping online praise for teachers ahead of their possibleto school.One, Eva, sang a thank-you to Mrs Sprowell from Ordsall ­Primary in East Retford, Notts.Aarav from Rainbow Primary in Bradford drew a portrait of Miss Iqbal.Aarav said: “Thank you for sending me learning resources so I can keep myself busy at my home in this dreadful crisis.”Kevin Courtney, of the NEU, defended his -page check list.He said: “The checklist is detailed because there are so many considerations to take into account when dealing with a school situation, particularly as we are looking at our youngest children going back first.“Parents would expect nothing less.”Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, said unions should be “as concerned about the risk to many thousands of vulnerable children” of not being educated.Evidence shows kids are not as vulnerable to Covid-.The virus can live on paper for ying s of time, but government advice is to wash hands rather than avoid books.Professor Matthew Snape, from Oxford University, said “only a very small number of children” get sick from Covid-.He said: “Also, it seems the children who get Covid- do not become ‘super-spreaders’, unlike what we see in viruses such as influenza.”NOTHING in le can be called “risk-free” — but is there evidence ato schools is safe for kids and teachers The World Health Organization’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan has insisted: “There have not been big outbreaks in schools.”She added that “children are less capable of spreading” the virus.A test in Iceland found none of  under-s tested positive.Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter of the University of Cambridge has calculated the risk of kids dying from it is one in .million.There have been ­contradictory scientic claims on whether kids can be signicant spreaders of the virus.A recent German study of almost , coronavirus patients found that “children may be as infectious as adults”. It advised against “unlimited reopening of schools”.An Australian study found nine members of staff with coronavirus had come into contact with  students. But none had contracted it from the children.A nine-year-old Brit infected in France did not pass it on despite being in contact with more than  people.Early research from Denmark and Norway shows reopening schools has not triggered a spike in the disease.British scientists Dr Alasdair Munro and Prof Saul Faust found children do not appear to be super-spreaders. They concluded: “Governments worldwide should allow all children back to school.”UCL’s Professor Russell Viner backed them, but with safeguards.He said: “Around  children die in car accidents in Britain every year. But parents don’t say, ‘Never get in a car’. They buy child seats and wear a seat belt.”Statistics, of course, fail to highlight the suffering and loss felt by every bereaved family.Yet the current science seems overwhelmingly to signal that it’s time for primary classes to .A Department for Education spokesman said: “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being back with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their well-being.”The reopening of schools in  European countries has not led to a signicant increase in coronavirus infections, EU education bosses said today.Blaženka Divjak, Croatia’s education minister, said: “So far we haven’t heard anything negative about the reopening of schools, but it is probably too early to have final conclusions.”You’d think they would be keener than anyone to heed the science.But when Government experts or even the WHO contradict their desire to keep schools shut, they ignore it.Or they wheel out the BMA — asit represented medical opinion, rather than just being another left-wing trade union.Their latest wheeze, part of an absurd dossier of  demands, is to refuse to mark homework in case members catch Covid from a book. The risk is minuscule . . . nil,they take precautions.Most primary kids the Government wants toon June  get minimal homework anyway. And, as Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam says, they neither catch the disease severely nor pass it on like they do flu.It is impossible to ensure that teachers will be  per cent safe before they— as it is for any worker.There WILL be a statistically tiny threat as long as this disease persists. Le is full of them. This is another. Unions cannot demand an exemption.This protracted shutdown is already doing immense damage to pupils, especially the most disadvantaged.The truth is the unions are capitalising on a mainly middle-class reluctance toto work because many have lost perspective about the real risk.In fairness, that reflects the success of the Government’s “stay home” campaign.But now deaths and infections are falling steadily and the economy is in dire trouble we must sht gear.Publishing daily figures of Covid recoveries will help. Not least because the total will be in the millions, as opposed to the death toll of ,. Awful though that latter figure is, it remains a small fraction of the overall.So does the recent estimate of those now infected: some , in England, of a population of ,,. Only one in  has Covid, in some areas far less.The fact we can now test everyone with symptoms, and have , contact tracers, should drive even those figures down.Teachers, meantime, should ponder whether their unions have lost the plot.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK. I’m not going to scare the children.”Channel  continuity introducing The Last Leg: Locked Down Under: “Two comedy geniuses coming right up here, Aisling Bea and Kevin Bridges.” So, one comedy genius then. And Aisling Bea.BACK in southern India, on BBC’s hugely enjoyable series The Real Marigold Hotel, Duncan Bannatyne has just bottled the eight-hour overnight train journey to Madurai.It could’ve been the heat, it could’ve been the food and a dodgy stomach.Or it could’ve been the fact Britt Ekland is all over him like a cheap sari, no matter how many times the multi-millionaire businessman mentions his “young we”.A woman who will not be denied, Britt needs male validation and constant reassurance.So, during one of the brief moments she wasn’t pestering Duncan to within an inch of his le, Britt visited a vedic astrologer, in downtown Puducherry, and hit him with this loaded question. “Am I going to have work ”Work  Are you ever, Britt. “The sun is in the constellation of Hasta,” apparently.So I’d expect work on your face, work on your eyelids, work on your rear end.

Only stupidity and a tin ear for the public mood can explain my own choice for that title.It’s BBC’s credit card roulette series I’ll Get This, which concluded last week with Fleur East, Johnny Vegas, Mike Tindall, John Barnes and Sue Perkins taking part in a series of minor challenges and guessing games, in a roped-off area of a London restaurant, to settle a £ dinner bill.Not the sort of guessing games that might have engaged viewers, like “guess the appearance fee” or “guess how many TV presenters would have to die before Sue got another stab at hosting the Baftas”, but a game of “Guess the weight of the waiter”.A task more suited to the Bullingdon Club, you’d imagine, but this lot prodded him, lted him and generally talked about him like he was invisible.“I can squat it.” “Oh God, he’s big boned.”Having established, beyond reasonable doubt, there was almost nothing the five celebrities wouldn’t do to get on television, it was the response to the next question – “Do you like or dislike being famous ” – that sealed its place in lockdown hell for me.Unanimously they went for the latter, not with any self-awareness or sarcasm, but with a genuine sense of hurt that anyone could think otherwise and former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Sue Perkins apparently speaking for them all when she very solemnly replied: “I love my job, I dislike being famous.”Some job, Sue.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock set out plans for easier, faster and simpler testing so more people can access a Covid- test to tellthey currently have the virus. Wider testing will be essential before the government can ease up properly on the UK lockdown - because itaposll show whether the virus is running rampant again. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons on May : Everyone aged  and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test. That applies right across the UK in all four nations from now. It was the latest expansion in eligibility, three weeks after testing was extended to over-s or people who need to leave home for work, with symptoms.The Health Secretary added: Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. But you may have to drive for a -minute round trip to get a test and there has been heavy demand on new kits posted to your home. Meanwhile, critics have slammed the slow rollout of testing to the wider community after it was initially ditched due to lack of capacity in March. Hereaposs who is eligible and how the system will work. Who is eligible for a test   As the UK extends its testing capacity a growing list of people are eligible to be tested:All those in the UK who have symptoms and are over five years old in the UK All those working on the frontline in health and social care * Patients in the NHS and residents in care homes **But thereaposs a catch... What about care homes  More than a third of all the nationaposs care homes have had an outbreak after repeated failings to take tests early in the pandemic. Staff and residents were not routinely able to have a coronavirus test until April . And nor were patients coming into care homes from hospitals routinely tested until that date. The governmentaposs guidance now says care home residents and staff can be tested, with or without symptoms. But the governmentaposs roadmap for easing lockdown says this is only expected to roll out fully by June . How sick do you have to be   You need to show symptoms in order to be tested, unless you are in a care home of the NHS. The three main symptoms are a new and persistent dry cough a temperature and changes to your sense of taste or smell.    It will showyou currently have Covid-. This is useful to proveyour symptoms are actually the virus. It does not showyouaposve had Covid- in the past. It will help people work out when they and their household members canto work safely. Where do I log on to book a test  Visit the governmentaposs web page. Slots for home testing kits tend to appear at am and can be snapped up quickly. Where do I go to get tested     The first port of call is a drive-through testing centre. The government expects you to be able to drive for up to  minutes from your home to get to a drive-through site, leaving some with potentially a -minute round trip. WhatI canapost drive   For those who donapost live near enough to a testing site or canapost drive there are other options. Home testing kits have been available since late April. The availability of these was limited at first, with , selling out within two minutes on the first day. What about other ways of getting tested  Meanwhile apossatelliteapos test kits are also being sent directly to care homes to enable residents with symptoms to be tested. And the Army is helping set up mobile testing units which travel the country to places like care homes, police stations and prisons. How long will I wait for results     The government claims test results are being turned around and sent out within  hours, or  hours for home testing kits after you send the sample off. Test results come by text message. But many have reported longer waits for tests to come back. Why were essential workers getting tested first  The aim was simple - to ensure they can get back to work.

Primary schools in England are meant to reopen from June , starting with Years R,  and . But unions and some whole cities are staging a revolt, warning there is not yet enough evidence that itaposs safe. The key questions are whether children are infected like adults are whether they then spread the virus to others and whether theyaposre less likely to get seriously ill and die. The science is still evolving, and papers from the governmentaposs scientic advisors are expected to be published in the coming days. But we do already have some hints about what the evidence shows. These have come in several forms, but here in England weaposve had two very helpful updates in recent days. They are an overview of scientic advice from the Department for Education, and an update from Englandaposs Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Prof Jonathan Van Tam. They both say children could be as likely to get infected as adults but that when they are infected, theyaposre much less likely to get sick. The key question for reopening schools, though, is how much children transmit the virus to others - and hereaposs also where the evidence is hazy. Here is what Prof Jonathan Van Tam and the Department for Education have said. Can children become infected with coronavirus  Yes.Government scientists believe younger children - aged up to  or  - might be less susceptible to getting infected with coronavirus.But they warn the “degree of confidence is low” - meaning they can’t be sure one way or the other. Prof Van Tam said emerging data suggests the rate at which children become infected is “about the same as in adults, possibility a little lower in the younger children”. Is coronavirus as serious in children as adults  No. When children get Covid- it’s usually a “much more mild” disease than in adults, Prof Van Tam said. It is pretty well established thatthey get coronavirus, young children are far less at risk of falling very ill or having to go to hospital. Medical experts believe up to  children in the UK have been affected from a condition similar to Kawasaki disease, which has been linked to coronavirus. However, the exact nature of any link is still being investigated and Prof Van Tam said we are talking about “very very very small numbers” of children.  How much do children transmit coronavirus to adults  Some studies suggest younger children may transmit the virus less than adults. But this evidence is mixed and provides a low degree of confidence at best”, the government says. Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam added the data is pretty sparse at the moment”.

Class sizes will be halved and even kids’ artwork banned from the walls. Parents have been given a glimpse of how schools will operate when they reopen to more pupils as lockdown restrictions are eased. Class sizes will be halved, start times will be staggered and contact will be severely reduced for children in reception, Year  and Year  whoto primary school from June . Plans for the reopening were ramped up as the Government announced tests would be available to everyone over five who shows symptoms. It comes as the Department of Health revealed , people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, a rise of  on the previous day. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the UK proposals for schools tois “sensible”. He said: “It is very clear that the number of children who are badly affected by this disease is very, very, very small. “So, the proposals that we’ve made for schools are safe and they are sensible.” He added it is up to head teachers whether staff are allowed to wear face masks or visors while they teach. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, has urged the Government to write to him setting out the scientic evidence behind the decision. It is understood the Government has examined an Australian study which showed kids are “not the primary drivers of Covid- spread” in schools. The Government is looking at a phased reopening of primary schools from June . A planning guide – from the National Education Union, Unite, Unison and GMB – advises schools that two-metre social distancing must be maintained as there is a lack of scientic evidence that children do not transmit the virus. Political leaders in Liverpool and Hartlepool have pledged to keep schools closed while the infection rate remains higher in their regions. And Bury council in Greater Manchester said that while high levels of the infection remain in the North West “the borough will not be reopening schools on June ”.  Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said: “I worry the June  date is too soon for the North. “The virus is at a dferent stage in dferent parts of the country. It can’t be fair parents and pupils here are being told it’s OK for schools to reopen when their areas still face a higher risk than the South.” Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden repeatedly refused to rule out teachers, heads or council leaders being “penalised” for defying advice to open from June . Marsden Infant and Nursery School near Huddersfield, West Yorks, has laid out markings on the floor to keep children separate.  Head teacher Frances Swallow and colleague Sarah Yates were also pictured converting the assembly and dining hall into a classroom. At Kempsey Primary School in Worcestershire, children of key workers were photographed yesterday keeping apart while eating, studying and washing their hands. Elsewhere inidual head teachers are refusing to act, while some are warning of huge problems. Evelyn Davies, of Coldfall Primary School in north London, said: “You can’t get young kids to keep away from each other and to not touch each other, it is impossible.” Denmark became the first European country to reopen its primary schools on April . Other countries with schools back open include Belgium, Austria and Portugal.

Police were out in force on Monday as the operators stepped up services as lockdown measures ease slightly. The Rail Delivery Group said services this week will increase from about % of the standard timetable to %. However, capacity will be reduced to as little as % of normal levels to ensure social distancing, while passengers are being urged to avoid non-essential travel. But publishing guidance for both passengers and operators the Department for Transport warned that “there will be times and some settings on public transport where social distancing is not possible”. But with the Government calling on those who cannot work from home in certain industries toto work from tomorrow, it is inevitable that more people will be getting public transport. So here is the governmentaposs advice to make sure you can make any trip you have to take as safe as possible. Do not travelyouaposre unwell or clinically extremely vulnerable People have been asked not to take any non-essential travel by public transport, but evenyour trip is essential you shouldnapost take ityou have any coronavirus symptoms or are part of the vulnerable groups, people with underlying conditions, who the Government have urged to shield themselves. If youaposre self-isolating you should also, obviously, avoid public transport Check ahead and travel when quieter Even as public transport routes begin to step up activity, there is still likely to be disruption to the nornal arrangements, so the government is asking people to plan a head by identying alternative routes and options in case of unexpected disruption. They also suggest thatcan, travel at off-peak times, and you should ask your employer to consider letting you start late or leave early to avoid peaks.  Buy tickets ahead of timeOn some services you will now now required to book ahead of time. If you are travelling on  LNER trains then you need to know that is ‘reservation only’ travel from  May Passengers will have to reserve their seat orthey are using a flexible ticket such as a season ticket, they can avail the online seat reservation tool or speak to staff. Passengers who have an existing reservation should choose a seat at a distance and ignore the seat details. On other networks it has been recomended that where possible, that you book your travel online through your transport provider’s ticketing app or website. Some networks - like Nothern Rail - have said that the layout and frequency of trains might in order to ensure social distancing.So you must check the timetable ahead of time - and where possible just pick up your ticket in advance. Consider contactless payment to buy tickets. Try and keep social distance If you can take a less busy route, you should try and obviously where possible you should keep metres away from people. But where that isnapost possible the advice is to keep the time you spend nears others as short as possible and avoid physical contact. It adds: Be aware of the surfaces you touch. Be careful not to touch your face. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. To avoid crowds it suggests you try to start or end your journey using a station or mode of transport you know to be quieter or more direct. For instance, walk the first or last mile of your journey, or alight at an earlier station, where this is possible.  Wear a face covering and travel lightly While the guidance stresses that wearing a face covering is not a legal requirement it stresses thatyou can wear one while on public transport you should. And it suggests making a list of items that you need to take with you in order to minimise the luggage you take. Also, the advice suggests you donapost eat or drink on public transport. Pay attention to the safety instructions around you and follow basic travel ettiquette Operators have been told they must set out schemes to try and make travelling more secure and this will mean restrictions on where you stand or how to queue. It goes without saying that you should follow these. It may mean going into or out of a dferent entrance or only boarding from a particular part of the train or bus.

Bury in Greater Manchester has now joined Hartlepool and Liverpool as they reject plans to allow teachers and childrento the classroom on June . The council has now written to all headteachers in the area outlining the reasons behind their decision. The statement claimed the reopening classrooms would “pose an unacceptable risk to pupils, staff and communities of vulnerable people.” Labour councillor for Bury Tamoor Tariq said on Twitter that the governmentaposs position is ill advised and not one we can follow. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson warned last week that he would resist sending kids back at the beginning of next month, saying he had concerns about whether schools would be able to operate safely. He told BBC Newsnight: “I’m not going to take risks with children’s lives or with staff and teaching professionalsapos lives.” While leaders in Hartlepool said it they would be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. Last weekend, senior minister Michael Gove told parents it was safe to send their kids back to school - but confusingly added aposthere would be risksapos. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “It is absolutely safe,” then said the only way to be sure was to “stay at home” as there is “always, always... a risk”. Teaching unions fear it is unsafe for pupils and staff to go back to school on June . And Labour wants the test and trace system to be put in place before schools .  Mr Gove told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: Yes, teachers will be safe in schools... Some of the best leaders in current education have said that it is absolutely safe for children to , absolutely safe for teachers and other staff toas well. But askedhe could guarantee no teacher would be infected as a result of ing to the classroom, he said: The only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely. There is always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching coronavirus. You can never eliminate risk, but... it’s extremely unlikely any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak, andfor any reason there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them. Universities aposcould rush to reopen campusesapos Universities could rush to reopen campuses when it is still unsafe to do so amid increased competition to attract students, MPs have been told. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union , warned that leaving the decision to institutions could be dangerous as financial pressures could encourage them to reopen prematurely. The Office for Students , the higher education regulator, has urged universities not to make any promises to students that everything will be back to normal in the autumn termthis is not the case.

Speaking at the Downing Street press conference Dominic Raab confirmed the delay, but said it wouldnapost necessarily delay lting lockdown measures. He said: “All of these steps are a balanced assessment, not just of one or other element, but particularly the R level and the prevalence of coronavirus. “It’s still our intention to roll it out across the country for everyone to use in the weeks ahead. I can’t be any more precise at this stage The app, which is central to the governmentaposs programme for containing the virus while lockdown eases, was originally due to launch by mid-May, according to previous comments by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman today said that the app would now be coming within weeks. It is currently being tested by people on the Isle of Wight, where the number of sign-ups is supposed to have exceeded expectations. The development of the app has also been fraught with technical issues, with previous designs struggling to overcome some limitations imposed on the app by phone manufacturers and operating systems. Last week Mr Hancock said the target for roll out was mid may in a conversation with Sky News. The Health Secretary said: “We’re rolling out in mid-May. The Isle of Wight project has gone well so far, we’ve learned a lot about how the app operates, also about people who don’t have the app – how to make sure that they can get testing and the contact tracing can work for them – the interaction of the technology and the human-based contact tracing. “We’re pleased with progress, and we’re going to bring it in. And we’re going to learn the lessons from the technical improvements that we’re making from what we’ve seen on the Isle of Wight.” On Monday No insisted that while the app would play an important roll in the future of the track and trace regime, it was possible to do track and tracing work separately to the app. It comes as Mr Hancock confirmed that , contract tracers have been hired.  At the weekend the figure was ,, and Hancock had set himself a target of , by this week.

Lancashire Police have released pictures of the light green Toyota Avensis in the hope of finding those responsible for her killing. Aya was reportedly gunned down from a car window while walking to Lidl just  metres from her home in Blackburn, Lancashire, yesterday. The aposappalling and senselessapos daylight shooting has left the local community in shock and her family aposutterly distraughtapos, police say. DCC Terry Woods, of Lancashire Police, said: “We believe a green-coloured Toyota Avensis was used to commit the offence, and this car was later recovered nearby. If you saw the car in the area of King Street and Whalley Banks, oryou saw it being abandoned on Wellington Road, again we would urge you to get in touch. Similarlyyou have information about who had been using this vehicle either on the day of the attack or in the weeks preceding, please tell us. Police say Aya was killed after a light green Toyota Avensis with numerous people inside drove past her. Bullets were fired from the vehicle, with one of them hitting the teen. Officers later found a Toyota Avensis with the registration SV UBP.  DCC Woods added: This was an appalling and senseless attack on an innocent young woman, whose le was cut short while she was simply out doing some shopping. “First and foremost our condolences are with her family, who have lost their daughter during the holy month of Ramadan. “In the last  hours we have learnt that Aya was a much-loved family member and friend who was enjoying her studies at the University of Salford. She also gave her time to being a young trustee of the Children’s Society. For her le to have been cut short like this is unthinkable and her family are understandably utterly distraught. He appealed for anyone in the King Street and Whalley Banks areas of Blackburn around the time of the killing to contact police.  Ayaaposs family said:Our beautul -year-old daughter Aya has been taken from us in the most horric circumstances. She was the most loyal devoted daughter who enjoyed spending time with her family especially her brothers and sisters Ibraham, Assil and Amir. She excelled in her studies both at Blackburn Central High School and at Salford University where she was in her second year and dreamed of becoming a solicitor. She had just completed her exams and was learning to drive.

Five-year-old Frankie Lord is a symbol of the hope that the “opt out” system – and the Mirror’s Change the Law for Le campaign – will bring as it comes into force tomorrow. Mum Sophie Mansuy, , said: “We waited  months for Frankie’s heart. “No one can describe what it is like when you are waiting so long to save your child. It is so hard as a mother to put into words the gratitude you feel every day to the donor.” Frankie made history when he had heart surgery at just one minute old. Dad Chris Lord, , and Sophie, of Newcastle, then endured the long wait for a transplant to save him. A donor organ was found in August  and Frankie had his transplant days after Mirror boy Max Johnson in the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. But he suffered kidney failure due to anti-rejection drugs taken for his heart. Dad Chris, a bus driver, donated his kidney in January so Frankie couldhome without needing dialysis three times a week. Sophie said: “Max and Keira’s Law is so ­important. We saw Max and his family and cannot believe what they did to make this a reality. “What they’ve achieved is what every transplant family’s always wanted. Ten years from now I hope the shortage of donors will be a distant memory.” Sophie was asked to take part in the BBC documentary A Chance to Live but declined. She then watched as Max had the first heart op to be filmed live. “I remember the surgeon explaining to us you are signing consent for his heart to be taken out of his chest,” added Sophie, also mum to -month-old Freddie. “He said I can’t guarantee it will work when it goes back in. That was very hard to think about. We saw the film when Max had his transplant and I cried my eyes out.” The law is named after Max Johnson, , and his donor Keira Ball, nine, who died in a car accident near ­Barnstaple, Devon.  Everyone in England will be ­understood to want to be a donor when they die unless they opt out. Sophie wrote a letter to the family of Frankie’s donor, but said: “I did not expect anything back. They’ve given everything already. “We let balloons off on the transplant ­anniversary. I think of the donor family whenever Frankie does anything new.” Chris said: “We’ve seen people who’ve gone through hell and haven’t got a ­transplant. I’d recommend people get tested to seethey can donate.” They praised the Sick Children’s Trust, which offers families a place to stay during treatment and relies on donations.  Pandemic leaves transplants in peril Coronavirus is having a “devastating” impact on the number of lesaving organ transplants. The number of transplants per month in England fell from  in November last year to  last month. NHS figures also show that while  people died on the transplant waiting list in April ,  died in April . And the number of registrations for organ donations is down from  in July last year to  last month. Labour MP Dan Jarvis hopes to raise the fall in operations in Parliament today. He said: “These figures shine a light on the devastating knock-on consequences of the coronavirus. “As a nation, we’ll be dealing with the repercussions for years to come.”  Labour MP for Barnsley Central Dan Jarvis writes... One young le tragically lost, another courageously saved. As stories go, there are few more powerful than Max and Keira’s. Keira Ball was nine when she died. Despite their grief, her parents chose to donate her organs, including her heart, to Max Johnson, a boy in desperate need of a transplant. Max recovered from his op and has been a champion of the new opt-out system for organ donation, often known as Max and Keira’s Law.

Loss of taste and smell were today added to the list of symptoms that should warn sufferers to self-isolate to prevent passing on the disease – months after other countries had included it. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs: “Everyone aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test.

Mum Hannah Godwin, , noticed Leia had a rash and high temperature while sister Thea was “healthy and happy”. Leia was rushed to Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, from their home in nearby Risca three weeks ago. She was treated for an inflammatory disease in young children linked with an extreme reaction to Covid-. Hannah said: “It got dficult for her to breathe and she got transferred to critical care. “She went through a scary time. God knows what could have happenedshe hadn’t had the treatment early on.”  Leia’s arteries also began to swell to a le-threatening size. Hannah said: “The consultant said, ‘If there’s a rupture she’s not going to survive’.” Leia was then transferred to Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales in Cardf, where she tested positive for antibodies to Covid- and was treated in isolation. Hannah and husband Simon, , hope she will be allowed home soon. Doctors plan to do genetic testing to understand why she reacted the way she did. They also want to take blood from Thea to seeshe has had Covid- – andso, why she did not react the same way.The news comes as the link between the illness and coronavirus remains unclear, with some children testing positive for COVID-, and others negative.A report by doctors in Birmingham last week indicated that there was a link between the two illnesses, but now the chief scientist of the World Health Organisationhas revealed that this may not be the case. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Dr Soumya Swaminathan said: “Very recently there have been some reports of children getting admitted with a strange syndrome, something that looks like sepsis, something that looks like a disease called Kawasaki disease, which causes inflammation in the blood vessels.“Now, itaposs not very clear what the links are between Covid- and this syndrome. There are some children who tested positive for the virus and some who havenapost. “The WHO has discussed this with a group of international paediatricians about how to approach this, and the need to collect more data.

Kempsey Primary School in Worecstershire has been looking after  or so children of key workers during the lockdown. Some of the steps pupils are taking for their safety is a apostraffic lightapos system, which sees the children stand on spots while waiting to wash their hands. Other measures the school have taken include directional arrows on the floor to create a one-way system. Children also sit in segregated sections at lunchtime, with hot meals also prepared carefully for the local community. The tables are marked to show where pupils can sit at lunchtime and during classes. Bryony Barnes, head teacher, said the school is taking all precautionary measures to keep its pupils and staff safe when it reopens.She told Worcester News : Obviously this all depends on the governmentaposs five tests being met, but we are looking at what we can do to make sure the school is as safe as possible. It is a tricky one, but we are doing what we can to make it as safe as possible while also making the children and staff comfortable. We want them to be at ease as the school will obviously look and feel dferent when theyso we need to look at what we can do to reassure them and their parents and make them feel comfortable.Letters are being sent out to the parents, which will allow them to make their own decision about sending their children back to school. Staff are being trained on how to deal with pupils moving around the school while maintaining social distancing. Schools across England are preparing to open on June , despite concerns from parents and staff. But councils like Liverpool, Hartlepool and Bury have stated schools there will not reopen. Teaching unions warned the government’s evidence that reopening schools was safe from June  was “flimsy at best”. Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon said: The national advice telling us the lockdown is over is frankly madness. Opening schools was meant to happen as part of the second phase of easing the lockdown, at the same pace across the UK.  But Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all broken ranks and refused to reopen schools as soon as June . Meanwhile, the government has shown signs that dferent regions of England could end up taking dferent approaches. The plan is for primary schools to start reopening in a phased way as early as June . They would begin with years R,  and  ing in the first week of June, followed by years , ,  and  before the beginning of July.  Schools are being told to halve class sizes to , prevent those mini-classes mixing with any other classes, and implement one-way corridors, staggered break and start times and extra cleaning. Secondary schools are largely not expected back before the summer break. The exception is Years  and , who would get some face-to-face time to help transition to the next year. Exams are cancelled. Ministers have said there are no plans to keep schools open during the summer holidays.Yesterday top Tory Michael Gove claimed he could guarantee teachers will be safe - but then immediately admitted they might catch coronavirus.Askedhe could guarantee teachers will be safe when classrooms reopen, Mr Gove told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: Yes. I talked to the chief scientic advisor yesterday for the government, Patrick Vallance, and running through the figures - the R number, the rate of infection in the community overall - we’re confident that children and teachers will be safe.” Yet grilled over his claim, Mr Gove then admitted he could not guarantee all teachers would be safe. He said you can never eliminate risk and added: There is always, always, always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching the coronavirus.

The rest of the country may be celebrating the gradual lting of lockdown but those deemed high risk are likely to remain in isolation much longer. But many of our most vulnerable people are finding remarkable ways of coping.A Channel  documentary, Old, Alone and Stuck at Home, tracks the lives of some who show incredible bravery as they tackle the lockdown. Here, a few of them tell how they’re managing in such dficult situations... Desmond Gittens, Grandad Desmond Gittens, , is being looked after during lockdown by daughter Aisha, , in her house in Notting Hill, West London, with granddaughter Malika. He moved there from his flat in Cricklewood, North West London, where some of his close friends in the Afro-Caribbean community contracted the virus and died. He is devastated that he cannot say goodbye to them properly. Desmond : I’m a diabetic, I’ve come out of prostate cancer and I’m being treated for other issues like high blood pressure.My independence is really important to me. I didn’t think the lockdown would last this long – I thought it would be two weeks at the most. But we’re getting on OK. I have a drone and there’s a garden where I can fly it. And we have a treadmill where I do  or  minutes’ morning exercise. I usually do a big morning walk in my neighbourhood, so I’m missing that. In all the time I’ve been here I’ve been out once. I miss my friends. A couple passed away but I couldn’t go to their funerals. And I’m missing the rest of the family. Initially I was being shielded for my age, not my ethnicity. But when you see the statistics about BAME people I realise it’s for both. I’m  and I know full well I’m not here forever. But I’m trying to make sure this virus doesn’t take me. Aisha : When I knew lockdown was imminent I talked to family members and we made the decision it would be betterhe stayed here.I don’t knowhe’d have managed on his own. I’d have been constantly worried. For Dad it’s hard. It’s not just about eating, it’s about getting on a bus, going to get things for a meal. A conversation with the people in the shop. It’s those simple things. But he can’t go out. What’s alarming is the lack of information. We don’t know why dferent sections of the community are more at risk.  These figures are shining a light on the racism and inequalities that exist in this country. Disparities in health, housing, education and employment. Yyvonne and Chris Milne, The couple from Malvern, Worcs, have spent lockdown looking after daughter Clare, , who was one of the first children diagnosed with brain condition Rett Syndrome in . They are anxious about transmission of Covid- and her ability to withstand it. Yvonne founded charity Rett UK and was made an MBE in . Yvonne : We started a week before official isolation because of the limits of the care home to public access. Also, we’re in the vulnerable group, being over . And we’re important to Clare for the future. We’ve battled to keep her alive. Rett Syndrome affects one in , females.It results in profound physical and communication dficulties. They have no speech. And she has abnormal breathing. Clare is in that group who are the most vulnerable. I’m frightened about Clare catching coronavirus. It seems like the focus is only just coming on to social care settings. There has been a lot said about the NHS and that’s quite right. But there are people in care homes who are just being disregarded – in le and in death.Hopefully, ministers will look more closely at what needs to be done. Our daughter is being cared for by people who love her, highly trained people. But they are not paid a good rate for the fantastic job they are doing. Before the virus struck, Clare would come home to us every other weekend and stay two nights. We used to visit. We can’t visit now. But she does come home with us once a week.  We use full PPE. All the time, we are taking temperatures. We feelshe loses contact with us, she will lose her interest in le At the beginning of this we didn’t think she could survive lockdown, physically and mentally.Clare had pneumonia and sepsis last November and was in hospital  days. They didn’t think she would survive. Her lungs were compromised. That makes us worry more about her getting any infection.We want to make sure whatever le she has left is as good quality and as easy as it can be. She likes to do things she has always done. She has a routine. When she’s here it’s similar to being in the home – there are set feeding times. But we can do other things with her here she enjoys. We have a fish pond and she likes that. We sing to her. There are special times. Susie Davies, With serious underlying conditions, Susie, of West London, has had oian and breast cancer and recently received large doses of chemotherapy. She is vulnerable to infection but has found many ways to keep busy.  Susie : I’ve found things perfectly OK. I seem to have a lot to do. I’d already limited my activities because I’m on chemo and my immune systems have fallen so I’m rather susceptible to bugs.I don’t go to any of the cultural things I used to do, like go to galleries, cinema or theatre. I was visiting friends as well but now I’m completely limited. But I do make sure I speak to people every day. I have a nice Zoom group where we set each other tasks every weeks. I want to counter this stereotype of older people and people being shielded in their houses. It is not depression and helplessness and people screaming out of a window. I’m reading and watching boxsets. I’m also sorting out my house. You have to look ahead – although I have no intention of dying. I want to organise my possessions so they have a home. I want mine to go to inidual people so I have been labelling everything. I don’t ever have a dull moment. I miss not being able to go out driving. That’s something I’d love to do but it’s justyou break down or something then you are really in trouble. The only place I really have to go is the hospital. I don’t think my cancer can ever be cured but I’m very lucky. I feel very well. The prognosis is ultimately not good but who knows  It’s not like I’m young and my le is being stolen from me. But I do see it as a kind of cosmic joke that I can’t go out when time is so important. I don’t see this as a battle. I see this as all I can do to help my body. We have real lessons to learn from this lockdown. This is a great opportunity to improve society and right so many wrongs.

The -year-old, who dreams of one day being a nurse, said: Being a carer is dficult, but Iaposm absolutely loving it. The residents are all so lonely because they canapost have visitors and they miss their families, so itaposs nice to be the one bit of joy in their day. A lot are pining for company but you have to keep your distance so you canapost give them a pat on the shoulder or a hug. Erin has been playing football since she was four years old and previously played for West Brom and Coventry United, before she took time off to recover from an injury. But the centre back, who has played as part of the England Colleges squad at an under- level, was forced to temporarily hang up her boots when all professional football was temporarily suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak. And Erin admitted parents Mo, , and Tony, , who she lives with, were initially worried about her working on the frontline instead.  She said: My friends said I was crazy when I signed up. Mum and dad were worried because they didnapost want me catching anything but we donapost have anyone vulnerable in our family. They are really proud of me because of the things I have to do, a lot of people couldnapost do them. I never thought Iaposd be able to do the gruesome parts of caring but itaposs shown me that I can be a nurse. Erin said her PPE is a bit dferent to her usual pageant attire as she sports a face mask, gloves, apron and face shield covering her stunning looks during regular shts. She has only told one resident about her modelling career, who thought it was aposamazingapos.  Erin said: Some think the PPE is funny and over the top but obviously you canapost risk giving them anything. The only lady I told about the competition really encourages me. She thinks itaposs amazing. Erin submitted videos and images of herself to the Miss England YouTube channel catwalking in her garden and showing off her keepy-uppy skills to earn her place in the beauty contest. The Miss England Midlands semi-final was due to take place last month at Resorts World in Birmingham, but due to lockdown restrictions the contest is being held virtually instead, with the public and judges selecting winners who will go through to the final. Organisers are currently unsure whether the grand final, due to be held on July , will go ahead physically as this may also be held virtually too.  Erin, who is sponsored by organic beauty company ST Essentials, said: The reason I entered the competition is because I thought it would build my confidence, but I understand why we canapost do it on stage with an audience. Doing it virtually is a bit dferent, but I donapost mind. I canapost wait to get back into football though. My dad loves that Iaposm into it and supports me so much, but Iaposve had to do a lot of Joe Wicks PE lessons instead to keep fit. Erin, who lost her other part-time job at a coffee shop when the pandemic became more serious, says the hardest part of her new career is seeing how lonely the elderly she cares for are.

Tezra Finn-Johnston, , and girlfriend Emily Derrick, , first noticed their daughteraposs strength when they left hospital. They say at that early stage she was able to support her own head. She was born on January  and weighed just lbs oz and was on the th percentile - weighing less than five per cent of other babies her age. Now -weeks-old, Lula is able to stand unassisted, supporting her own weight. Tezra and Lula have been watching strongman clips on Youtube and think she might have been inspired. The first-time dad from Kingswood, Bristol said: When she was about a month old, she was having a tantrum and I tried to sit her on my knee to calm her. Instead of sitting down, she just stood on my knee and wouldnapost bend her legs. She did it a few more times later on in the weeks - eventually I thought wellshe can do it while sheaposs annoyed, maybe she can do it when sheaposs happy. I tried to hold her and supported her, and she managed to take her own weight. Everyone seems to think that itaposs unusual that she can hold herself up, even just sitting, let alone standing. I asked my mum - Iaposm one of four, and none of my siblings could hold their weight at her age. From everything Iaposm reading, it should be about nine months to a year that they should be able to support their own weight. The pair first noticed this when they brought Lula home from the hospital, five days after she was born. Tezra said: Pretty much from the day we left hospital she was able to support her head a little bit more than we thought she should be able to. She was holding it up for a few seconds and that shouldnapost be for a few weeks, but pretty much straight away she was able to do that.  Then we watched this Babies documentary on Netflix and on there they said babies are inherently programmed to crawl from birth.So I put her down on the mat and she was trying to crawl a bit. Then I put my arm behind her and she was able to push herself up the mat - propelling herself from my hand with her legs. She can also do it lying on her front as well. We noticed that and she was able to do that first time, so that was impressive. Iaposm just assisting her in doing what she likes doing - the first time we did it, she smiled at me. Itaposs like sheaposs showing off - she looks at you and smiles, itaposs like sheaposs trying to be a big girl! Tezra is a big fan of strongman competitions, regularly watching videos on Youtube. He claims Lula looks engaged when they watch the videos together - he jokes she might have been inspired by these to train herself. Tezra thinks another reason for her strength might be a good muscle-to-weight ratio, based on the fact she was a small baby at birth. One more might be her genes - Tezra stated that heaposs always been able to build muscle quickly.Tezra said: I donapost advise other people to try this with their baby, but I watched Babies on Netflix and in there I just got a few ideas from that really.Iaposve just always enjoyed being strong.When I was about , I started doing weight training and arm-wrestling - I was able to beat adults. Since then I just took up the weights. I just really enjoy being strong - not so much fit, but more the strength side of it. Iaposve always been interested in lting as heavy as I can. Only recently, since theyaposve had Youtube, Iaposve started watching some of the strong men on their private channels.

Unions, ministers and schools are in the thick of rows over when to get children back behind their desks in the UK, despite dozens of neighbouring countries having already taken the first steps. However, Blaženka Divjak, the minister for education in Croatia, said any apparent lack of negative impact should be seen in context, with many having only been re-opened for two weeks. Speaking to the press after a meeting of ministers on Monday, the mathematician and politician said the re-opened schools have very highly guarded conditions in place.

Denmark took the plunge first, re-opening nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools on April , following just four weeks of closures, leading parents to slam the government for using their kids as guinea pigs. Norway and France are also among those to have began the re-opening process, while Germany is allowing older students to . Franceaposs education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has told parents, meanwhile, it is more of a risk to their children to keep them at home. In an interview with RTL radio, he said  cases of the virus had been confirmed as , primary and nursery schools welcomed back pupils last week. He said: “It’s inevitable this sort of thing will happen, but it’s a minority. In almost all the cases, this happened outside of the school.”It comes as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Boris Johnsonaposs administration is right to start reopening schools.The PMaposs plans to begin sending children back to school next month has come under attack from teaching unions and some local authorities, with critics arguing it is too soon to lt the coronavirus-related lockdown restrictions.  In his address to the nation on May , Mr Johnson said Reception, Y and Y pupils would be the first to go back, starting on June  at the earliest. His ambition, Mr Johnson said, was that secondary pupils scheduled to take exams next year would get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays.Despite criticism of the proposals in some quarters, Mr Johnson has found an unlikely ally in three-time general election winner Mr Blair."},{"url":null,"title":"royal family newsletter must read","story":"NewsRoyal family newsletter - the must-read email with everything you need in one placeThe Mirrors Royal Family newsletter will bring the most important and interesting stories on the Queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, William, Harry and the rest of the Firm straight to your inboxShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJust put your email address in the box underneath this picture and we will start sending you our royal newsletter \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Ministers have told schools to get ready for reception, year one and six toon June  - but only when all the tests are met as it will be safe to do so. Officials have issued advice to headteachers on ensuring classrooms and playgrounds are as safe as possible with class sizes capped at  pupils and desks kept two metres apart. However teaching unions and the government have locked horns over whether itaposs safe for kids to go back to school on June . Furious union bosses have ordered their members to refuse to engage with the government and have a string of conditions that must be met before theyaposllto their classrooms. Liverpool, Bury, Hartlepool and Gateshead councils have all said they will not be reopening schools on June . Downing Street suggested that a final approval could come as early as this week. A spokesman didnapost challenge claims that the final decision could come this week as next week is half-term He said: You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can. Officials are adamant that nothing will happen before June  while the Government will publish its scientic advice and SAGE minutes on safety in schools as soon as possible.  Union leader Geoff Barton claimed today that the government will make the final decision next Thursday which coincides with the next three-week review into the lockdown. He said: It is also important to understand that the government will only make the final decision on whether to press ahead with the reopening of schools when it reviews the latest science on May , and thatthe evidence does not support this decision at that time, it will be delayed.Yesterday Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government was aposconfident children and teachers will be safeapos when schools reopen.Speaking on the BBCaposs Andrew Marr show, he said: “The clear scientic and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen, accompanied with social distancing.  The Governmentaposs roadmap gives no specic date on when a decision will be made on any changed but they will be announced at least  hours in advance.The five tests set out by Boris Johnson must be met before any relaxing of the rules.The Prime Minister said at the weekend that three of those five have now been met with work being done on the other two. Parents have been promised they will not be punishedthey decide not to send their children to school.  Liverpool city council became the first local authority to announced it would not be reopening its schools on June . It said the earliest date for lessons to resume in the classroom will be June  and only year six, the oldest children, would be allowed back. Until then it will continue to allow only the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils to attend school. Hartlepool council and Gateshead council have announced they also plan to delay the reopening of their schools.  Last night policing minister Kit Malthouse hinted that some schools in some areas may reopen depending on their infection rates. He was asked on Radio aposs Westminster Hour last nightthat could lead to dferentrates for schools in dferent parts of the country, is that something that could happen  To which he replied: In theory it could. It’s certainly the reason for us setting up this new bio security centre, as I think was outlined when it was announced, so we can monitor the progress of the virus across the country. Andlocalised action is required, it can be taken,there’s a localised outbreak.

They invited just their aposinner circleapos to the private evening celebrations, which was filled with dancing, booze and personalised touches.

As Meghan and Harry mark their second wedding anniversary, weaposve had a look back at all the dos and donaposts of the coupleaposs stunning May wedding. In the lead up to the big day, each guest was sent a seven-page instructions book, explaining exactly what they needed to do and all the things that were banned. When they arrived at the evening reception they had to surrender mobile telephones and any devices used for image capture. Bulky bags were also banned, and guests werenapost allowed to take presents into either the St Georgeaposs Chapel ceremony or the Windsor Castle reception. A dress code was also sent to guests as part of the invitation, asking men to wear either a dress unorm, morning coat or lounge suit, while women had to pick a day dress and a hat.  The guidance pack also included a long list of things people were banned from taking with them, and some of them were a bit odd. Perhaps the strangest prohibited item they felt they needed to list is swords. The reason behind the odd request was that by asking people to wear dress unorm, some may have wonderedthey should include the sword which is part of many of them. The couple also asked people not to wear medals on the big day.

Wilma Andersson, , disappeared on November  last year before police found a aposbody partapos a fortnight later which turned out to be her head. Her ex-boyfriend Tishko Ahmed Shabaz was arrested and has now been charged with her murder in a case that has shocked Sweden because it is deemed as one of the safest countries in the world, Expressen reports. The rest of Wilmaaposs body has yet to be found. Police claim the -year-old decapitated Wilma before wrapping her head in foil and hiding it at his home. Hundreds of volunteers had joined the search for Wilma after she was reported missing in Uddevalla three days after she was last seen. Her head was found on November  bringing the missing person search to an end and the launch of a murder investigation. Shabaz had already been arrested when the grim discovery was made and has been in custody ever since. Court papers claim Wilma died on November , the day she went missing, and alleges her ex-boyfriend cut up her body.  Police say they found blood on the floor of his flat and apostraces of Wilmaapos on a large kitchen kne. A unnamed police chief said: The suspect has retained a body part for an unknown reason and got rid of the rest of the body. Prosecutors claim Wilma was subjected to aposrepeated violenceapos during her death. Wilmaaposs devastated mum Linda has issued an emotional appeal begging people to continue their search and help her to find the rest of her daughteraposs body.  She told Swedish media: We want to find our daughter and sister. It is completely inhumane that we go through so please do not stop looking for Wilma. I hope people are observantthey see something aberrant in water or terrain. That people have their eyes open. Relatives told police Wilma has visited Shabazaposs home to pick up her things after ending the relationship. Shabaz told Wilmaaposs parents that Wilma had left the flat alive but police say they found her coat and handbag still hanging in his wardrobe - his neighbours also said they heard screaming from his flat.

To be fair, I am usually like that before a big game.“I had already gone through everything in my mind about what I wanted to do on the pitch and how to prepare.”Conway, who has also played for Cardf City and Blackburn Rovers, added: “There was little in the final itself as we went in at half-time with the scores level.“But I was always sure thatwe kept doing what we had been doing the first goal would come.“Thankfully it did and then I was able to get my two goals as well.“It is something you are always asked: ‘Is it the sort of thing you dream about when you are a kid,’ and genuinely it is.“When you are playing in the park with your mates, you hope that one day you can score in the Scottish Cup Final so to do it was one of the highlights of my career and one of the best feelings you can get.“Once the final whistle goes, it is all a bit of a blur but it was just great to see the sheer delight on everyone’s faces.“It is so hard to put into words exactly how you felt but there was a massive sense of achievement.”After the trophy was handed to United, the celebrations really took off on the way back to Dundee before the players partied the night away alongside ecstatic fans, with Conway heading for his favourite city night spot.“It was just carnage on the bus with all sorts of nonsense back to the club and then it was into the town to celebrate,” said the seven-times-capped ex-Scotland star.“I’d had a lot of nights out in Fatties but everyone was just having a great time and it was the best atmosphere ever there.“Everybody was absolutely buzzing and it was great to be able to celebrate with the fans.“Everyone was together like a big family.“After a couple of hours’ sleep, we then had the parade on the open-top bus.‘To be honest, a lot of us were still drunk! In fact the celebrations continued for most of that week.“We had expected the fans to turn out but we were absolutely stunned by the thousands in the city square and at Tannadice. It is something that will stay with me forever.“The  years have just flown by but there will always be a special bond with the lads.“It was one of the best days of my career and my medal still has pride of place in a room in my house.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53645070-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53645070-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53645070-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53645070-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee fc john nelms spfl","story":"The result of Tuesday’s failed SPFL inquiry vote has vindicated Dundee managing director John Nelms, according to a Dark Blues fan chief.Following weeks of back-biting and sniping over the Dens Park supremo’s now infamous voting U-turn at the start of April, two thirds of league clubs voted against an independent inquiry.With nine out of  Championship clubs voting ‘no’, chairman of the Dundee Supporters# Association, Kenny Ross, believes a “clear statement” has been made in relation to Nelms# actions.And Ross also insists the response from Dundee fans at large has been one of acceptance.He told the Tele: “The club seem quite relaxed about what’s been going on the past couple of weeks, not saying anything.“John Nelms doesn’t say much at the best of times but I think that relaxed attitude is echoed by the fans.“With nine out of  Championship clubs voting no, there is also a clear statement there and I think it vindicates John Nelms.“Personally, I would have liked an inquiry because there are questions that need answered but it was pretty overwhelming from Dundee’s fellow Championship clubs and % of all the clubs that it wasn’t wanted.“It’s clear from that there isn’t really a problem from most clubs on the U-turn – the majority wanted it with over % voting that way and the Deloitte inquiry said there was no wrongdoing.“With reconstruction talks ending, fans do wonder what John Nelms achieved through the U-turn but I think we are all past it now. I’ve not had anyone on to me about it all, there’s very little online about this week’s vote – I don’t think anyone really cares now.”Rangers vehemently led the call for a vote on an independent inquiry into the SPFL’s conduct during the coronavirus shutdown, as well as Dundee’s actions in changing their vote.That led to Gers fans bombarding online posts from the club and DSA social media, but Ross believes the reaction from fellow Dundee supporters is telling.He added: “Anytime the DSA are posting stuff on social media, we have to go through and delete loads of stuff.“It’s almost amusing now – Dundee fans responding generally laugh at them. Dundee have been getting hammered but they are not rising to it all and that, I think, shows the general feeling of the support.“It is bizarre because Dundee’s vote hasn’t affected Rangers really – our club has been affected more because there’s now no play-offs.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

It’s about who we are as a club, at the heart of our city region, supporting our fans and the wider community. We know that many supporters are experiencing hardship and it’s therefore important that a partial refund is made available.#Having said that, the club continues to invest in  full-time staff who form part of our critical community outreach call centre. We could have furloughed this group of staff but feel we are doing the right thing continuing these wellbeing calls and food deliveries to the vulnerable.#I do hope supporters will have seen the widespread positive impact the club and trust is demonstrating in our city region. The reality is that we are facing a financial crisis entirely outwith our control.

There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

letter to Scottish Sports Minister Joe Fitzpatrick, MSP, from East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill and MPs Allan Dorans, Angela Crawley and Pete Wishart, who represent racecourses in Hanmilton, Ayr and Perth urges a quick restart to racing when safe to do so.It says: ldquoRacing finds itself in a unique position compared to other Scottish sports in that our equine athletes, cherished so highly by those in the industry, have remained in training during thepandemic and will therefore be able to come back on shorter notice than the human athletes inother sports.ldquoWhen it is safe to do so, ato racing is the best way of getting the economic cogs of theindustry turning once more, and kickstart the benefits to the Scottish economy that horseracingbrings, even in a behind closed doors

have been tested and could be opened immediately to host tourists, Friedrich Joussen, TUI Group CEO said.Several other European holiday spots could also be among the list of destinations, including Greece, Cyprus, Croatia and Bulgaria, all of which Joussen described as ldquowell prepared for summer tourism.Austria and Denmark were named as possible destinations as well, being among a number of EU countries that are starting to reopen their borders.However, the roll out of flights to Europe will have to be done gradually, and in line with both government guidance on travel and the lting of EU borders.Holidays to Europe are also likely to be hindered by the  day quarantine period being enforced by many countries, with tourists faced with spending two weeks in quarantine in Spain before being able to start their holiday.In contrast, visits to France and Ireland will be unhindered by such rules.How will TUI make its hotels safe The package holiday specialist has outlined a ten-point plan, detailing how hotels will operate after lockdown is lted.Plans include restrictions on its popular self-service buffets, which are due to be reduced to a minimum.Instead, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to joint-venture and partner hotels.Guests will face limits on their range of entertainment and activities, with football tournaments set to be banned.Only events, sports and entertainment that involve a small number of participants, and without close contact, will be made available.Other measures include online check-ins, maintaining social distancing in public areas, such as gyms and corridors, and reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The safety measures it has set out for after lockdown form part of a wider package that includes plans in its retail outlets, as well as on flights, transfers to hotels, local excursions, and

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity. What is yours Already safety rules for the bug are being set by my children. Number one rule: dad must never sit on it, but he can pull it.The term rod for my own back comes to mind."},{"url":null,"title":"tourism-impacted-covid-19-lockdown-says-mp","story":"LAST weekendrsquos Bank Holiday would normally have seen East Lothianrsquos beaches crowded and towns and countryside thronged with visitors.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

As I shovel, I am kept company by the old male pheasant that flits between our garden and those on either side, leaving gleaming feathers in the shrubbery, and shrieking like a klaxon, lest any of us ignore him. He has a limp, which might be the result of a run-in with the fox that snatched his partner. Certainly, he seems to enjoy company, as he struts among bluebells and tulips, before ducking under the chicken wire into the field, to view the newly arrived and still timid flock of sheep.The tools Irsquom using would have been familiar to the first settlers: a spade, fork, hand fork and trowel. Therersquos nothing mechanical in our shed. This is not for idealistic reasons but because, as absolute beginners, we are more neanderthal than digital. Only when we have some idea of what wersquore doing will it be safe to let high-powered tools loose around the place.Thanks to lockdown, parts of the back garden have been gone over more minutely than the dig at Pompeii. Every quarter of an hour I tip out another bucket of stones on to the cairn behind the woodshed. What began as a pimple is now half way to Ben Nevis. Some of the stones can be classied as boulders, which is where Alan comes in.I never thought of myself as having anything in common with Robert Burns, but discovering the ratio of stone to soil on your patch makes you realise what he and his brother had to contend with on Mossgiel farm, which was famously rocky and unyielding. As Irsquove worked over the earth, square foot at a time, the ground level has been gradually dropping, so that soon wersquoll have a sunken garden.Digging is good for letting the mind roam, but it leaves little energy for anything . While you can see how Burns might compose poetry during his rural drudgery, it is obvious why Seamus Heaney did not follow his family on to the farm. Among his most famous poems, and one of my favourites, is Digging, where he recalls watching his late father in the potato drills ndash ldquoBy God, the old man could handle a spade. The loss he still felt is palpable. Yet while he chose not to till the earth, like his brothers, he would instead use his pen as a spade, digging up ideas and his countryrsquos past.One of our neighbours spent years clearing their garden of rocks and detritus, more of which would surface whenever it rained. Among the tell-tale trophies they unearthed was a childrsquos school slate. I remember the weekend when I was a young girl when my father, digging, came upon a curved brick, and then another, eventually revealing a neat circle above the village spring, that had been filled in long ago. ldquoWell, well, well, he said. I still hope for such a find, but perhaps wersquove not been delving deep enough. All that has come to light so far has been fragments of china and pottery.The other evening, though, something interesting did turn up. I thought it was just a small animal bone but, after tossing it aside, retrieved it for a second look. Brushing off the earth, I found a hollowed-out flattish tube, with a pinhole opening at one end, stamped with neat letters. It was the stem of a clay pipe, the sort Silas Marner would have clamped between his teeth. Later, I found out it was from the Victorian pipe-making firm of William Christie, which operated in the Calton in Glasgow, from . A few years ago, the remains of the factory were excavated, including the kiln in which this pipe was very likely fired. Given that Christiersquos produced around , pipes a week, many of us probably have one under our feet.Irsquove always been fascinated by the things produced by metal detectorists or those with inquisitive dogs. Last week, I told Alan about the discovery of a ,-year-old Parthian warrior in Iran, whose teeth were in such good condition that a dentist who examined the skeleton said they were like implants. Alan was unimpressed, saying the real story was that theyrsquod been able to get hold of a dentist who, these days, are as rare as hensrsquo teeth.The clipping, mowing and shearing in Hoolet seems set to continue. While we all grow thatch, no weed or wild grass is allowed to rear its head. Only the village green has been letting the side down, turning into a meadow where the tip of squirrelsrsquo tails give away their position. Last weekend, a socially distanced posse resembling the Magnicent Seven set to work after a couple of hours of mowing, strimming, grass-gathering and edging, the green now looks fit for a game of bowls.Usually this is the councilrsquos job, a man with a sit-on mower and face mask whirling around the trees asdoing a cycling proficiency test.

They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others. Just playing with a dog releases enough dopamine to give you an instant high.Irsquove come to rely on this dopamine fix.

And they encourage us to find even a small amount of happiness in every moment, regardless of how bleak it seems.:Susan Swarbrick: How dogs are enriching our lives more than everAs humanity tries to find a way through the coronavirus our ability to understand its signicance is both a blessing and a misfortune.

For a long time, most Scotstook the constitution for granted. Independence was a minority interest and many Scotswould casually vote SNP for ious local or strategic reasons without any sense of independence being a threat ndash in fact, wersquod vote SNP without independence really crossing our minds.In retrospect, that seems remarkable, but thatrsquos how it was. I once asked the former Scottish secretary Malcolm Rkind why the constitution wasnrsquot a bigger issue  or  years ago and why devolutionists like him werenrsquot pushing harder for change and his answer made sense. It just wasnrsquot dominating Scottish politics, said Sir Malcolm, andit was, why werenrsquot , people marching down the street demanding reform Of course, they are marching nowand a lot of Scots have found the whole thing stressful. I suspect many unionists are, by nature, cautious people and instinctively prefer the status quo, so change or constant agitation for change is uncomfortable for them. Theyrsquove been trapped in the back of the car while their parents bicker and squabble in the front ndash and we never reach our destination.Which is why, politically, the last few weeks have been a relief for many unionists. Broadly, the Scottish and UK governments have followed the same policy on coronavirusand Nicola Sturgeon has struck a collegiate tone. Shersquos also appeared to pull back from her usual approach of emphasising dferences with Westminster, which, I suspect, is one reason her coronavirus approval rating is high among Tory and Labour voters as well as nationalists.:Scots trust Holyrood to stop new virus wave, but not WestminsterThere are some Tories and unionists, however, who seem to want the alignment between Holyrood and Westminster to continue at all times. For example, the Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw questioned why Ms Sturgeon did not move from the ldquostay at home slogan at the same time as the Prime Minster, the implication being she was up to her old tricks of looking for dferences with Westminster for the sake of it.But firstly, the First Minister was right to be dubious about ldquostay alert: itrsquos a rubbish slogan. Secondly, she has worked closely with the UK Government ndash the SNPrsquos Mike Russell pointed out how extraordinary the co-operation is on coronavirus given the stand-off on everything . And thirdly, to expect Scotland to align with the UK at all times is a bad idea, not only because the virus ies regionally but because total alignment misunderstands devolution. The SNP may have been guilty of seeking dference for the sake of it, but some unionists have been guilty of the opposite offence: seeking sameness for the sake of it.What devolution shows is that the reality is in the middle and that dference within the UK is a necessary and desirable part of the system. Indeed, it was part of the case for a Scottish Parliament in the first place that it would be dferent from Westminster. It was said, for instance, that a less adversarial approach would be fostered by the U-shaped chamber and a high number of female MSPs. Then along came a female MSP from Irvine who was inspired to enter politics by a female MP from Grantham. Bang goes that theory.But in other ways, Holyroodrsquos dference to Westminster has been critical to its development. When he was first minister, Labourrsquos Henry McLeish pursued policies irrespective of whether they were dferent from the rest of the UK, on free personal care for the elderly for instance. But part of the reason for Labourrsquos decline in Scotland was that his successor Jack McConnell avoided policies that might create dferences with the leadership in London. It also explains the success of the SNP. Most people donrsquot value dference for the sake of it, but dference when necessary became a way to judge Scotlandrsquos politicians.At least initially, Alex Salmond seemed to understand this when he succeeded Mr McConnell. The emphasis of the SNPrsquos first administration in particular was on being responsible and competent in government, although Mr Salmond was not scared of taking off his jacket and having a fight with London when he thought he needed to.But somewhere along the line, mainly because of the  referendum, this balance between dference and responsibility was lost. The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon knew being dferent to London was popular with a large swathe of voters and in that sense reversed what Henry McLeish did. Mr McLeish pursued policies irrespective of dferences with the rest of the UK, whereas it often felt like the SNP pursued dferences with the rest of the UK irrespective of the policies.:Coronavirus: Politicians and facility bosses say Scottish Government must follow rest of the UK in care home testingTo some extent, coronavirus has re-tuned the parameters again. Nicola Sturgeon has been competent and responsible during the crisis and it was only when the PM, not the FM, changed tack in England that dferences emerged. Not only is this how devolution is meant to be ndash regional dferences when judged necessary by the dferent leaders ndash I suspect itrsquos how most voters would like it to be. We donrsquot want to be the same as England for the sake of it, and we donrsquot want to be dferent for the sake of it, we want to be dferent to England when itrsquos right for Scotland.In that sense, dference is a good thing and nothing to be scared of, even for unionists. The problem is that a few of the most committed unionists, and Tories in particular, seem to view any dference as bad or an SNP plot rather than part of the process. Earlier, I summed up the s with one word ndash chaos ndash but chaos and dference are not necessarily the same thing. Dference done the right way ndash the way itrsquos been done under coronavirus ndash is part of devolution. The aim is dference thatrsquos dynamic but respectful. Itrsquos dference when needed but not for the sake of it. Itrsquos devolution done properly.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

These companies are now ignoring my emails ndash so the next step will be to send a Letter Before Action and then a small claims actionnecessary.ldquoI have a lot of sympathy for these companies and would be happy to wait for a refund until later in the year, but given that they are completely refusing a refund altogether, and given the position at law clearly provides that I am entitled to a refund, I feel like I donrsquot have any other option than to raise a small claims action.Read more:Hotel boss: Holidays will feel like s after lockdownAnother couple, Emily Liddle and George Ridley, who live in Edinburgh, had booked flights to Japan on March  but they were cancelled a week before they were due to travel.When they contacted the airline, they were told they would get a full refund, allowing them to book with a sister airline, which they did, but that flight was also cancelled.Now both airlines are saying they will only provide vouchers, not a cash refund.Ms Liddle said: ldquoThose two flights cost just shy of pound,.

The Committee emphasises the importance of documenting and recording relevant information. It is clear that there should be no deliberate attempt to evade FoISA by failing to do so.The committeersquos report, published today, follows a pre-coronavirus inquiry into the Freedom of InformationAct, or FoiSA, which took effect from mid-.The committee found FoI laws had failed to keep up reforms, and the blurring of the previous ide between the public and private sectors.The result was many private firms involved in providing public services, and in receipt of signicant public funds, were not covered by the right to access public informationThe committee recommended the Scottish Government looks at introducing a ldquogateway clause to automatically include companies and groups receiving public money or providing a service within the remit of the Act, allowing information on the spending of the funds and the provision of services to be accessed by the public.The committee suggested a ldquofactors-based approach, extending the coverage law based on the extent to which an organisation delivered or helped delivery a public , the degree of public interest in relation to the , and the cost to the public purse in delivering the it.The report also said FoISA should be amended to ensure public bodies and private firms cannot use confidentiality agreements to keep information secret, and said the First Ministerrsquos absolute veto over FoI releases - never yet used - should be abolished.Labour MSP Anas Sarwar, the acting convener of the Public Audit Committee, said: ldquoLegislation must be robust, clear and enforceable.ldquoWe heard in our evidence sessions suggestions of a sht in recent years in the level of information being routinely recorded in connection with official public business.ldquoWe are absolutely clear that there should be no deliberate attempt to evade FoISA.ldquoConsideration should also be given to amending the legislation to make explicit that tools such as WhatsApp, texts and ministerial private email accounts are covered by FoISA.Opposition parties are currently trying to repeal a tripling of the time public bodies have to answer FoI requests introduced by ministers in emergency coronavirus legislation.The Scottish Government was approached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"keir-starmer-better-field-donkeys-cabinet-asses","story":"If youre going to try to smear the leader of the opposition, surely theres nothing less likely to achieve that aim than highlighting the fact he set up a donkey sanctuary on behalf of his disabled mother \"Man of the people \" queried a Sunday paper. Keir Starmer has made much of his working class roots. The son of a nurse and a toolmaker, he rose through the grammar school system to take a first at Leeds University then become a human rights lawyer before being appointed director of public prosecutions in England.The Sunday paper in question slipped in that Sir Keir was making pound an hour in his lawyering days, which seems somewhat a bargain for a Doughty Street silk.His mother, we learn, was no longer able to go outside to care for the donkeys towards the end of her le but enjoyed watching them from the window of her home, which overlooked the field.The story also says that Sir Keir has a \"half share\" in his late parents semi-detached house, which is on the market for pound,. Presumably this means that hes inherited the property from his parents, making another unusual step for a right wing paper to be critical of inheritance.Unless he was throwing bunga bunga parties with the donkeys, this isnt much of a scoop. Its surely preferable that he filled a field with donkeys than a cabinet with asses.The land, were told, would be worth pound million, were it not green belt land, which cant currently be redeveloped, and were Sir Keir looking to sell, which he says he is not.I suppose the idea is that the Labour leader is a hypocrite for calling himself a socialist while owning assets worth several million. And yes, there are plenty who would say that it matters not a jot that the land is used as a donkey sanctuary.You are, of course, in an eliteyou have the spare cash to buy a large plot of land to satisfy the whimsy of an ailing parent. But it matters more, I think, to voters what the elite choose to do with their money than the fact that have it.If we look at Sir Keirs opposite number, we have Boris Johnson referring to his second income of pound, as a newspaper columnist as \"chickenfeed\". Jeremy Hunt bought seven properties and entirely forgot about them.This attempt to discredit Sir Keir by suggesting hes too rich to be trusted comes as his approval ratings rise above those of Mr Johnsons for the first time.As the pandemic wrought its awful effects on the UK, there was a general sense that politics as usual should be set aside and a sense of unity displayed as the government set out how it would deal with the health and economic effects of Covid-.At the beginning of the pandemic there wasnt an awful lot for the opposition to do as the measures being suggested were largely of the left anyway.Mr Johnsons approval ratings were highest when he was away from the role and there was a general consensus that it would be inappropriate to criticise the Prime Minister in his sick bed. Now hes ed to the day job and seems wholly unprepared for Sir Keirs forensic questioning at PMQs, perhaps having grown used to far less pointed interrogation from the Labour leaders predecessor.As furious concerns are being raised about the governments handling of the pandemic, of deaths in care homes, lack of adequate PPE for front line staff, and the effects of systemic inequality, as a small example, all eyes now turn to the opposition.Keir Starmer is currently giving the impression of a sensible man with a robust grasp of what his role is and certainly the reports of his performance so far are positive.At the same time, the measures put in place to deal with the social effects of the pandemic are being rolled back. The Mayor of Manchester has raised concerns the provisions for housing rough sleepers are to be ended. There is a war being raged against teachers.As I wrote several weeks ago in this column, there had been a pledge by Priti Patel to end the surcharge paid by overseas doctors - that has been dropped.There are suggestions that we might, as a society, emerge from this crisis with a positive shake up of the old ways and a greener, fairer, more equal new order put in its place. To achieve this will take radical thinking and hard pressure from the left.The political ceasefire is ending and this brief smear attempt on Sir Keir is a sign of politics ing to business as usual. Business as usual is one thing, but the Labour leader must force policy away from the usual and towards something more progressive. We cant just move on, we must move upwards.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place.

It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe.

That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

She added that while we are making good progress, we certainly aren#t out of the woods yet.Announcing the new easing of lockdown, Mrs Foster appealed for people to behave sensibly, and strongly condemned reports of large parties inside a Belfast apartment block at the weekend.She said: Over this last few weeks, in what has been a very testing time for our people, inidually as well as wider society, people of all faiths have turned to prayer in their homes and have used ious digital s to stream religious services.The decision to open religious venues for prayer has been deemed sufficiently low risk in terms of Covid-, but we do urge those who are availing of this service to exercise common sense.We will of course keep under review when will be the right time to permit religious services in places of worship where the buildings are big enough to accommodate social distancing, but we ask you all to be patient and we will let you know once the scientic and medical advice indicates it#s safe to do so.Outdoor activities such as golf and angling have also been given the green light to recommence, while groups of up to six people from dferent households can meet outdoors with social-distancing in place, including in people#s gardens.Mrs Foster explained that it is not the time just yet to meet other family members indoors.The scientic and medical advice has led us to conclude that there can be outdoor gatherings of up to six people from outside the same household provided that social distancing is properly maintained, she said.We are not at the time just yet to allow people to meet other family members from other households indoors.They have been hard-won freedoms and it is vital that when you exercise those freedoms you do it in a way that does not put anyone #s safety at risk Arlene FosterWe understand that#s going to disappoint some of you but we would ask you to remain patient and trust that this Executive, informed by the most up to date scientic and medical advice, is in the best position to guide you when it#s safe to do so.It is a matter we will constantly review and I give you that commitment.The First Minister urged those who suffer any symptoms of Covid- - now including the loss of taste or smell - to self-isolate for two weeks.They have been hard-won freedoms and it is vital that when you exercise those freedoms you do it in a way that does not put anyone #s safety at risk, she said.Mrs O#Neill said people needed to remain alert to stem the spread of coronavirus.She added: Last week when we launched the Executive strategy on the pathway to recovery, we acknowledged how we do not underestimate for one second the impacts the severe restrictions have on everyone right across our society.But we also acknowledged that public compliance and support has held firm and there#s no doubt that people have and continue to show great patience at this dficult time.Our top priority remains to save lives by combating the spread of the virus through the targeting interventions and the measures and by everyone working together collectively, including hand washing, body hygiene and social distancing.Going forward, our whole society will be alert to targeting the risks to reduce the spread of the virus and further outbreaks.The Health Minister indicated that an announcement was imminent in respect of the , people here who are shielding.Referring to guidance to those deemed more vulnerable to the virus, Mr Swann said that the advice will be updated ahead of the end of the initial -week shielding period.I fully understand that all those shielding would like some clarity that the situation will not continue indefinitely, he said. I want to make absolutely clear that shielding will last no longer than is deemed clinically necessary. This work is being taken forward on a NHS-wide basis, led by the UK#s four chief medical officers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So, the point about anosmia is it doesn#t always come as the first symptom.Evenit does, it is followed by the cough, the fever and many of the other symptoms I have talked about, referring to the WHOdefinition.So you don#t miss those cases.The important thing was to work outthis would add any sensitivity to the diagnostic cluster we were using and the answer is that it makes a small, a very small dference, and we have therefore decided to do it.In Northern Ireland , SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, who sits on Stormont#s health committee, urged people to be aware of the new symptoms. I welcome the statement issued from the chief medical officers across the UK, which contains an important update on Covid- symptoms.They now consider anosmia, a loss in your sense of smell or taste, as a symptom. If this applies to you, please follow the guidance and isolate with everyone in your household. Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen#s University, said the additional information would help inform the public.We have known for quite some time that loss of taste and or smell is associated with SARS-CoV- infection and Covid-.This symptom may even be rather specic to Covid-. It is encouraging to see it being added to the list of relevant symptoms that would lead to isolation, he added.A study led by Professor Tim Spector at King#s College London found that % of Covid--positive patients reported loss of smell and taste, compared with only % of those who tested negative for the disease.Speaking about the findings on April , Prof Spector called for the rules to change, saying those with a loss of smell or taste needed to self-isolate.On Monday he heavily criticised the government#s stance so far, saying infected people had been encouraged back to work due to a failure to track symptoms properly.He said , to , people in the UK with Covid- were currently not being told to self-isolate, even though they had the virus.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We welcome the cautious approach adopted by the Executive, which continues to prioritise the protection of health and wellbeing, with particular emphasis on those who are most vulnerable.We appreciate the recognition in this recovery plan of the importance of the local church, and public worship, in the lives of many people. There is a strong desire to increase the level of pastoral contact where that can be done safely.In particular, we are keen to respond to the appeals from those who find great comfort in visiting their church for private prayer, from couples who are anxious that they can proceed with their marriage ceremony and from parents who wish to have their child baptised.We are conscious that the Christian call to be good neighbours is a call to civic responsibility in the protection of public health. Partnership across all sectors of society, in solidarity with the most vulnerable, will be critical to minimising the threat of Covid-.In our churches we are currently undertaking risk assessments and putting in place response plans that reflect the unique circumstances of each local context and will be sustainable in the long-term.A letter of welcome signed by Rt Rev Dr William Henry, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Most Rev Eamon Martin, Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland Most Rev John McDowell, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland Rev Sam McGuffin, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and Very Rev Dr Ivan Patterson, President of the Irish Council of Churches, was delivered to the Executive yesterday afternoon.One of the signs of hope to emerge has been the way communities have pulled together in support of their most vulnerable members, the Church leaders said. That same spirit needs to shape a vision for recovery that leaves no one behind.Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor Noel Treanor said the reopening of churches for private prayers may y from place to place.This will be a tremendous consolation to all people of faith, particularly those who are grieving, he commented.Each church will open only when it is safe to do so and this may y from place to place. The support and patience of parishioners while these measures are put in place is greatly appreciated.Organised gatherings for prayer or devotions are not permitted at this stage, and the public celebration of Mass and the other sacraments remain suspended.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was that anxious I called the police yesterday just to warn them in case it would have been chaos.But the message we#ve been putting out is: #Take it easy, we#re here for a long time#. And it has worked.Keen gardener David Irwinfrom Belfast was taking no chances as he arrived wearing gloves and a face mask.I would normally do a lot in the garden. I#m delighted to be out. And, of course, from the garden centre point of view I think they had been struggling as well, so it#s a win-win for everybody.I tend to put gloves on when I come out, usually some sort of facial covering... particularlyit#s going to be potentially busy.I work at a health centre myself so I#m quite used to keeping my distance. We thoughtit was very busy when we arrived we#d come some other time, but it#s not too bad and the way they#ve got it organised is pretty good.Couple Ann-Marieand David Scottfrom Dunmurry were out to buy new flowerpots for the front of their house. We#ve been in the garden all day, every day, said Mr Scott.It#s so nice to get out of the house for a while. We knew it would be busy but people are doing a good job with social distancing and it feels safe. People seem to be looking after each other.Mother and daughter Sarah Sheldonand Paula Winchesterfrom Belfast said gardening during lockdown had helped to reduce stress.It makes such a dference to your le to come to a garden centre, Ms Sheldon added. At Coleraine Garden Centre owner Alan Hall has introduced a number of measures to keep customers safe, including social distancing, controlled admissions and a one-way system.Mr Hall said the Executive#s decision to allow access to garden centres in Step One of its easing of the lockdown restrictions had saved him a signicant sum of money.He said: Lting the restrictions could not have come at a better time, because had it gone on until Step Three or Four, it would have been too late in the season and I could have lost tens of thousands worth of stock. We have plenty of plants ready for sale but bedding plants might be the problem because although we grow some, most come from our suppliers and they are struggling.Among those who were delighted to be browsing the hundreds of bedding plants, shrubs, bushes and trees was Karen McCloskey from Dungiven. It is great to see the garden centres open because it gives you hope that things willto normal again, she said.I love the garden and I have a big interest , but I am actually here looking for plants for my sister#s garden because she doesn#t know what to buy.I#m going to get some bedding plants, something to put a bit of colour into the garden, so I am looking for pansies, viola, petunias and some ivy.William and Karen Thompson from Portrush were mainly looking for trees for land they purchased recently.Karen said: We have an acre site we want to use to create a woodland but we#re buying plants that will do well in shade as well. We want this woodland filled with deciduous trees and the plan is it will be our legacy long after we have gone.Keen gardener Krissi Rochelle from Ballymoney had her car boot packed with a colourful selection of azaleas, rhododendrons, lupins and grasses and was itching to get home to start planting.I have waited patiently on this day and couldn#t wait to get here, she explained. We moved from England a year ago, opened a BB but obviously we haven#t had any guests so we have used the time creating a garden because there wasn#t one there before.I am delighted that I was able to get everything I was looking for. I#ll be out in the garden for the coming days getting everything in place.In Templepatrick Richard Fry, managing director of Colemans Garden Centre, said he will be luckythe business breaks even this year. To be honest, I think  we have to write off. There#ll be no profitability as such for this year. If we break even we#ll be doing well. We are limiting the number of people through the door to just two per household. We have people on the front door, we have people on the back door, we have a one-way system in place, we#re asking people to sanitise their hands, he added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As revealed by the Derry News earlier this month, the proposed bridge would span an intake of water near the Fort George site, expanding the Quay Trail into Bay Road park. The planning application was received by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Service on March  and is in the early stages of consideration. The proposed bridge will provide a link from the city centre to Muff in County Donegal. It is part of the wider North West Greenway Network project which aims to develop .km of cross-border greenway, including: Derry-Buncrana, Derry-Muff, and Lford-Strabane. googletag.cmd.push  Funding for the project has been provided through the EU’s INTERREG VA programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body . Match-funding has been provided by the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport in Ireland. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, welcomed the submission of the planning application. She said: “I am delighted this key infrastructure project, which will complement the emerging City Deal riverfront regeneration plans, has reached this important milestone. Subject to planning approval, it will play a signicant role in connecting people through our infrastructure, facilitating more people to get outdoors and choose sustainable travel options, whilst benefitting peoples’ health and wellbeing.” googletag.cmd.push Paying tribute to everyone involved for advancing project development during this emergency period, Mayor Boyle continued: “Now, more than ever, there is a real need for investment in projects which encourage a more active, healthy lestyle. Once completed, the proposed new bridge will further enhance the City and District’s growing greenway network.” Gina McIntyre, Chief Executive of SEUPB said: “This bridge is an integral section of the North West Greenway Network’s route , which will link Derry to Muff. It will encourage more people to choose an eco-friendly form of travel, one of the core objectives of the EU’s INTERREG VA Programme, which has been designed to support more sustainable forms of transport, on both sides of the border.” She continued: ”It is also important, as we emerge from COVID- restrictions in the coming weeks and months, that we rebuild our society and the economy in a more environmentally-conscious way. This greenway will help support a more socially distanced recovery process, an approach that will pay real and tangible idends for us all in the future.” Further details on the project can be found at www.nwgreenway.

Mr Middleton said: “Enhanced commitment from the Executive for the graduate medical school is very welcome. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

To get ahead of them, you need to be quick off the mark.This weekend will see theof their soccer leagues behind closed doors, marking a conclusion to the sporting lock-down due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.With nine games to go, a win for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would see them cut the margin at the top to a single point by the time leaders Bayern Munich kick off in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.The decision comes after the government gave the green light to games going ahead in mid-May and approximately , tests were carried out on the players, coaches and support staff from all  clubs in the top two leagues at the end of April.The German league website reported a second wave of testing, around the , mark, has flagged up two positive cases which will be monitored.The countrys leader Chancellor Angela Merkel is highly-qualied and holds a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. She is happy the country has achieved the goal of slowing down the spread of the virus.She handed the responsibility to the organisers of the league and they have put a special sports medicine and match operations task force in place to managed the move back to competitive sport.Tier two club Dynamo Dresden has since put their squad and management team in isoaltion for two weeks after two players tested positive for coronavirus. The rest of the leagues will go ahead.If only we had locked down as quickly in this part of the world. Thank God for local communities and for the GAA, who acted swty to lead people once Leo Varadkar signalled the need to act in early May.The Taoiseach was naiumlve during his appearance on the Late, Late Show to hint at the chance for the All-Ireland championships to be played this year.It is dficult to see how, but the GAA leadership has since issued the statement confirming that there will be no inter-county action until October and club activities wont begin before mid-July,they even do.It leaves uncertainty surrounding the chance of playing games behind closed doors, which is not ruled out, but anyto action – club or county – is subject to public health guidance. googletag.cmd.push SAFETY FIRST When I think back to club month in April last year, there is nothing I would like better than ato action. Laveys clash with Swatragh ending in a draw, Foreglen and Claudy going down to the last seconds and Banaghers clash with Dungiven decided by a point. It would make you jealous thinking about it.Everybody knows how tight the calendar is and that there will only be room for county or club,there is a . But not both.With all players essentially club players and the chosen few on county , it is only fair the GAA cater for everyone and scrap the county scene. It may seem like the nuclear option and an extreme one, but the hierarchy would get huge respect for making such a dficult decision. This reinforces how well clubs rallied around those in need. It was the GAA at its very best.I would feel for Derry hurlers though, who were in a terric situation to eventually get out of Division B. So maybe the GAA could finish out the few games involving the relegation and promotion, so that it is an even keel when  comes around the corner.Deep down and with a realistic hat on, I cant see much being played. The safety of a nation is just far too important. We are not Germany. They got off to a better start, with stronger leadership coming from the top.I just hope the GAA dont force teams to play behind closed doors. It is not an option. There is some dference between Bayern Munichs Robert Lewandowski and say... Derrys Karl McKaigue.Big Lewandowski, now that all the players are tested, can be kept in exile from his family. Professionals can stay in hotels and there is money there to fund that.McKaigue is a physiotherapist and potentially working on the front line. How can he possibly stay in isolation. Are the GPA going to be able to pay himhe stays at home  I wouldnt think so and Derry will not be able to pay him to stay in separate accommodation between games.As regards testing. A GAA player could be tested on a Monday to seehe is able to train and pick up the virus after that. His test could come back clear and he could infect the rest of the  and the opposition come the following Sunday.It just isnt feasible. If it is not safe for supporters to attend games, then players are the same.Watching the Bundesliga this weekend should be a reminder to decision makers of how a country can benefit from acting early and in a calculated manner.Us sporting addicts, we will just have to keep watching it on television. When the time comes to , it needs to be the right time...not just a rushed job. We deserve as much. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Irish rugby tour postponed. More...

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

With thousands more claimants now trying to access welfare support – many for the first time – the pressure on local advice services has never been higher. Applications have sky rocketed, as employers struggle to source support for employees as well as secure the long-term future of their business, and families seek aid as they face the sudden stark reality of le without a regular income. googletag.cmd.push The community and voluntary sector in Derry has mobilised to provide a network of support, and one vital component in that resilience effort are the local advice service organisations who are providing round the clock guidance and information for those in most dficulty. They have seen a surge in demand for information on support mechanisms such as the Job Retention Scheme, Self-employment Income Support, Statutory Sick Pay, Universal Credit and mortgage advice. Jacqueline Gallagher is manager of the newly branded Advice North West – formerly Citizens Advice Bureau. Used to dealing face to face with their customers, they have been adjusting to the challenge of working remotely assisting people by email and phone and the limitations that brings. googletag.cmd.push Weve been so busy since we entered lockdown, it is a time of great uncertainty for many in our communities with a large volume of iniduals and families worried about their security of income, housing and employment, she explains. We have dealt with a large influx of people who have had to access the benefit system for the first time. “This can be a time-consuming process at any time but with the inability to provide face to face advice services we have had to be inventive in our approach to surmount the current social constraints and limitations. Its very tough for people who have never before had to navigate the benefit system and are now having to do so in such unexpected and upsetting circumstances. “They are afraid of not being able to pay back debts, losing their homes, not being able to feed their families – its an unbelievably anxious time. “The dficulty is that everyones situation is dferent, so each person needs a specially tailored approach. Our team dedicates themselves to ensuring the wellbeing of those who access our services. Jude McKinney is the Welfare Rights Manager of the Resource Centre Derry where the team has also been adjusting to new ways of working introduced to fast track services that are under increasing pressure. It really has been a challenge for our team, he admits. We definitely saw a major spike in demand for services at the start as we had a lot of new issues to deal with. We received advance funding from Council and we have been allocated additional money through the Community Fund which helped us to meet this initial demand for services. We anticipated having to cover a lot of additional hours to allow for the extra filling out of forms. “When we first entered lockdown we saw a huge surge in claims for things like employment benefit, self-employment support and the self-isolation job retention scheme. “Then when the furloughing scheme was announced – something which no one was familiar with – it was another challenge helping both employers and employees understand how the scheme works to benefit them. We can no longer facilitate face to face appointments which is in itself challenging and we anticipated it would mean a lot of extra out of hours work for our staff. But thankfully there have been some fantastic measures introduced by the Department for Communities in terms of easement. They stepped in to introduce a number of easement mechanisms including a six-month extension of payments for existing claims, which has meant we havent had to process a huge volume of renewal forms like for example Work Capability Assessments. “We can also now sign on a claimants behalf so they no longer have to come in to the centre to sign forms, which has been a big help. While this has given us a bit more breathing space we now anticipate there will be a spike in form filling come September and October. So there are definitely more pressures waiting down the line. Its hard to imagine how we will ever resume normal ways of working. I think this will all lead to a review of how we deliver advice services which will see it transformed in the long-term and I think we have a long way to go before we thingsto any kind of normality. Dove House is located in the heart of the Bogside in Derry, an area already suffering from high levels of deprivation. Welfare Advice Coordinator Donna Burke and the team of eight advisors based there have been inundated by calls from new claimants, but are buoyed up by the strength of the community resilience efforts in the area. I can see how it can be so frustrating for anyone trying to access benefits when there is so much uncertainty and change at the moment, weve had to adapt as best we can, she admits. The biggest concern is quite simply ensuring that people have enough money to live on. Its as basic as that. “With so many new claimants, they have to get registered which can be a complicated process in itself, but then we have to explain to them that they will have to wait until that support comes through which leaves people extremely anxious. “There can be no room for error. Thats upsetting for our advisors as well. Im so proud of our team – they are going above and beyond the call of duty every day – no one is turned away evenit means calling people back over and over again to make sure we can get them the help they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The announcement was made this afternoon at Stormont by the Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill. The first entry of students is planned for September . The new medical school has been welcomed byLondonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Redmond McFadden. “This is excellent news, not just for the North West region but also for Northern Ireland, said Mr McFadden. The hard work starts now to recover from the impact of Covid- both on the health of our population and on our economy. googletag.cmd.push A Graduate Entry Medical School will have a hugely positive impact on our regional economy and will provide a signicant boost to Northern Ireland’s healthcare workforce. By training and retaining new doctors, nurses and other vital health professionals locally, we can signicantly bolster our health service, especially at a time when it is under extreme strain. Mr McFadden said that the necessary work was done to ensure that the first students can start at the medical school next year. “Everything must now be done to ensure the school is open and ready for its first intake of students in September . googletag.cmd.push The Covid- emergency has highlighted the importance of our health service. Finally delivering the Medical School would be a lasting legacy to the efforts of our frontline healthcare staff during this crisis. “I am very pleased that we will finally have a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee. It is testament to the combined efforts of those across business, education, healthcare and politics, who have worked together on this campaign. As part of the wider City Deal for Derry City and Strabane, the Medical School will drive real economic and social change across the North West and help address years of underfunding and underinvestment in the region.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The announcement was made this afternoon at Stormont by the Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill. The first entry of students is planned for September . The new medical school has been welcomed byLondonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Redmond McFadden. “This is excellent news, not just for the North West region but also for Northern Ireland, said Mr McFadden. The hard work starts now to recover from the impact of Covid- both on the health of our population and on our economy. googletag.cmd.push A Graduate Entry Medical School will have a hugely positive impact on our regional economy and will provide a signicant boost to Northern Ireland’s healthcare workforce. By training and retaining new doctors, nurses and other vital health professionals locally, we can signicantly bolster our health service, especially at a time when it is under extreme strain. Mr McFadden said that the necessary work was done to ensure that the first students can start at the medical school next year. “Everything must now be done to ensure the school is open and ready for its first intake of students in September . googletag.cmd.push The Covid- emergency has highlighted the importance of our health service. Finally delivering the Medical School would be a lasting legacy to the efforts of our frontline healthcare staff during this crisis. “I am very pleased that we will finally have a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee. It is testament to the combined efforts of those across business, education, healthcare and politics, who have worked together on this campaign. As part of the wider City Deal for Derry City and Strabane, the Medical School will drive real economic and social change across the North West and help address years of underfunding and underinvestment in the region.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery. This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly. It would also reduce access to the funding available for affordable housing through co-ownership..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Council Lead.jpg","title":"Council staff face furlough  ","story":"UP to  Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff could be furloughed as a result of coronavirus, it has emerged.It is believed that the move would save the local authority in the region of pound, a month, with suggestions that the organisation is currently ldquohaemorrhaging money due to a major loss of income.The local authority plans to utilise the job retention scheme with the majority of affected employees working in leisure centres, museums and arts, tourism and community facilities across the district.All these facilities have been closed since mid March as a result of the lockdown.The local authority has confirmed that it will make use of the coronavirus job retention scheme for employees who work in services where there has been a loss of income and who cannot be redeployed.The council is insisting that, at this stage, it does not know how exactly many employees will be impacted.It is understood that some politicians have been informed about the plans to furlough council staff and are confident the employees can retain their jobs when the ious centres and community facilities reopen.Politicians are also supportive of the councilrsquos senior management team for doing all it can to maintain key services during the pandemic and its key role in helping spearhead the community response on the ground.In addition, politicians say they recognise that prudent financial management is critically important in the current climate, given the challenges that lie ahead.News that up to  staff could be furloughed comes amid increasing concern that many local authorities across Northern Ireland that are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds each month may potentially have to look at reducing some services as a result of the pandemic.While many councils do not have major cash reserves, Newry, Mourne and Down Council is reported to be in a much healthier position than most.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the Provincersquos  councils mdash has warned of a ldquocash crisis for local councils as a result of the pandemic.The organisation said councils have gone beyond their remit, giving out , emergency food parcels and opening leisure centres to facilitate this operation.NILGA chief executive Derek McCallan said the organisation is expecting to see councils lose poundm in the non-payment of rates during the current financial year in addition to monthly losses.ldquoThat really points to one thing, cessation or a severe reduction in services, he continued.NILGA wants the Treasury to provide the same financial package it has have given English councils, which translates to around poundm for Northern Ireland. The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley. Frankie Fitzsimons was fourth on Davy Blackrsquos Anns Penny.The winner, making his debut, ran in the colours of Rathfrilandrsquos Sam McKee, better known as Uel, who told me not all that long ago, that they arrived at the track that day in a makesht horse box and parked beside some of the lorries from top stables.The East DownshireOpen Farmers Race went to Grange Valleyrsquo, owned and trained by former good amateur Ballymenarsquos Samy Patton and ridden by Robert Steele, who rode all his runners.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them. It is also vital that was is created is used all-year-round, not just during the traditional tourism season. The focus is also in on making the most of the natural environment that we have in Newcastle and the surrounding area.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said that the Belfast Region City Deal represents a major investment.He said in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, the investment proposals focus on the Mournes Gateway project and several schemes in the Newry area, including a city centre regeneration project, new theatre and conference facility and southern relief road.ldquoFunding is also being made available for digital infrastructure enhancements and enhanced skills and employability provision across the region, said the spokesman.He said the vision from the City Deal investment was to deliver inclusive growth, deliver up to , more jobs and increase the value of goods and services produced in the area by poundm annually..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Going.jpg","title":"Newcastle man’s extraordinary job post at the South Pole  ","story":"IMAGINE looking out of your kitchen window and seeing a humpback whale idly swimming by, or a small team of seals at play in the water.Therersquos snow and ice everywhere, animals outnumber humans, noise is completely muted but yet you have never felt more alive or connected to the world.Thatrsquos the extraordinary experience Newcastle man Kit Adams enjoyed when he took up a job offer which saw him as postmaster at the Port Lockroy research station on Goudier Island.Itrsquos located off the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, more commonly known as the South Pole, and is one of the most remote places in the world.The  year-old mountaineer lived and worked with a small team of people over four months in what has become an important heritage site and a tourist destination for people who want to see the thriving penguin community.Employed by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Kit handled the postcards sent by hundreds of holidaymakers on Antarctic cruises who visit the island and claim to have set foot on earthrsquos most southerly point.Back at his familyrsquos home in Newcastle, Kit has had time to reflect on what the experience meant to him.ldquoThe one thing that became clear to me is that itrsquos the type of environment that I want to spend more time in, said Kit, who coped with freezing temperatures of up to minus seven degrees fahrenheit.ldquoIt really affirmed what I thought I wanted to do, and thatrsquos spending more time in the polar regions. Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

Ms O’Neill then criticised the health minister, Robin Swann.Sinn Fein was slow to allow cemeteries to re-open, until it came under pressure from its own community, then was slow to support church re-opening, until likewise.

We have taken unprecedented steps to protect everyone, but particularly those most at risk from serious illness.ldquoThis has helped the NHS prepare and cope with coronavirus and, even though we have sadly seen more than  people die, it has helped to save many more lives. But this strategy comes with its own costs to peoplersquos wider health and wellbeing and long-term costs to our economy.ldquoWe are keeping these regulations under constant review. We know coronavirus will be with us for a long time yet but we want to see whether there are things we can do while we continue to tackle the virus and while the search for better treatments and a vaccine continue.The framework ndash and the seven questions ndash will help determine when the time is right to relax some of the stay-at home regulations.The seven questions are:bull Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus bull Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection bull How can it be monitored and enforced bull Can it be reversed quicklyit creates unintended consequences bull Does it have a positive economic benefit bull Does it have a positive impact on peoplersquos wellbeing bull Does it have a positive impact on equality The Chief Medical Officer for Walesrsquo office has developed the Wales-wide programme of surveillance, case identication, and contract tracing.It will have four main strands ndash improved surveillance of cases of coronavirus effective identication of cases and contact tracing learning from international experience and engaging with the public.Dr Atherton said: ldquoAction to ease the lockdown restrictions will need to be supported by a comprehensive public health response, which will need to developed quickly and at scale.ldquoAcross the UK, we have worked and put in place unprecedented measures to contain and delay the spread of coronavirus. We have also worked to reduce the overall impact of the virus by strengthening essential services, including healthcare.ldquoWe are now working towards a new recovery phase to lead us out of the pandemic but only when the conditions are right.The First Minister added: ldquoCoronavirus is not going to disappear ndash it is likely it will be with us for a long time. We will need to have some sort of restrictions in place for some time yet to continue to control the spread of the virus and reduce community transmission.
