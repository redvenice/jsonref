Photographer Julia Zabrodzka presents this little-known part of modern Mayan cultureby Bartlomiej Kaftan, photography by Julia ZabrodzkaAngelica Cardona, with a microphone in her hand, stands among a group of candidates. Her voice reverberates firmly from the stage: “The art of weaving forms part of our Mayan identity. Nowadays, however, cheap printed fabrics are replacing our ancestral hand-woven textiles. This is how capitalism is killing our culture and preventing us from putting our heart in each artisanal piece we produce.” Her last words sound like a cry of protest. Seems rather like a leftwing party’s rally than a beauty pageant, doesn’t it? Well, indigenous queen elections are not typical beauty contests.They may at first seem similar to Miss Universe events but differ from them in many ways. There are crowns awarded to the winners, but adorned with Maya glyphs and symbols rather than glitzy jewels. There are teenage candidates boasting their best dresses, but made of hand-woven cloth with patterns characteristic to their villages rather than silk or satin. And there is a jury, but its decision is based on the candidates’ knowledge of indigenous culture and the ability to give a powerful and meaningful speech rather than their physical beauty or measurements.Originally this was her only task. First contests were organised as early as in the 1920s and their winners were supposed to adorn a parade at a local festivity. Reinas indígenas, as they are called in Guatemala, still do that but their status has changed substantially. Nowadays they are regarded as ambassadors of their communities. They visit other towns during their elections and represent their own community’s attire and traditions. They often give speeches on subjects such as women’s rights or discrimination. And they are expected to work for their community – in many different ways.“Once I got invited to a neighbour’s family celebration. He asked me to give a speech to his daughters and cousins, encouraging them to stay at school and warning against teenage pregnancies,” recalls Lily Ixkotz’ij Saloj, 2017-2018 queen of the village of Chaquijyá and Sololá municipality. Odethy Tzep, 2017-2018 queen of Chuachinup, organised literacy classes for children and workshops for adult women on the subject of domestic violence, which affects many communities.Sara Elisabeth Mesia from Santiago Atitlán made recordings for a local TV station to raise awareness of growing pollution of the local lake, which is vital for its subsistence and tourism-based economy. And Marily López, queen of Huehuetenango department, is preparing a huge billboard to show the ethnic ersity of her region, where as many as nine indigenous languages are spoken. “Maya people still suffer from racist comments and attitudes here, especially in the capital of the department,” she admits. And that is something she hopes to change.The position of reinas indígenas is, however, not free of contradictions. They are expected to represent their communities, yet get hardly any support from local authorities. Most of them don’t receive a single quetzal to cover the expenses of travelling to other towns. They have to rely on their families’ support. Little wonder, then, that parents are sometimes reluctant when their daughters receive an invitation to take part in the election. “At first my mother was worried,” recalls Sara Elisabeth Mesia, who had to give up her job in a restaurant in order to be a queen. Working, studying and serving her community at the same time was simply too much to handle. “But now she is so proud of me. And keeps saying that we will handle that somehow.”Similar feelings prevail in most families. Being a queen may be a burden, but is also a once-in-a-lifetime experience. In conservative, patriarchal communities few young women get an opportunity to travel around the country or have their voice heard in public. This is something Matías Saloj – father of Lily Ixkotz’ij, 2017-2018 queen of Chaquijyá and Sololá municipality – is really proud of, even if his family had to make sacrificess. Matías says that they had to give up a part of their cornfield to accommodate all the guests of the fiesta at the end of Lily’s term. “We managed that”, he says firmly. “And my daughter could come up to the stage and claim with her head held high: Chaquijyá, mission accomplished!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd103b88e16efa7aba1ded1944ab7753568d9812/0_0_1000_725/master/1000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3ef77dd96b3a30a8a6f8fde07195b466 960w","title":"luton airport briefly bursts into life as wizz air flies in from bulgaria","story":"A few hundred seasonal pickers fly in on Friday, a far cry from the 49,000 passengers a day before pandemicJust after 7.30 on Friday morning, the arrivals hall at London Luton Airport burst into life following a 10-day shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. More than 100 passengers arrived on Wizz Air flight W6 4301 from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, on the airline’s first scheduled commercial flight since the crisis.Most of those arriving were seasonal farm workers on their way to fruit and vegetable farms across the UK. Others said they had come to work on building sites, as lorry drivers or in kebab shops.There were also members of British-Bulgarian families, who had found themselves trapped in Bulgaria when the coronavirus struck and borders closed.Among the first through the arrivals hall was Sakak, a 35-year-old man from a village near the capital, Sofia, who asked not to disclose his surname. He and all the other passengers were wearing masks provided by the airline.“I need to work, I need the money,” Sakak said when asked why he had chosen to fly from Bulgaria, where there have been relatively few cases, to the UK, which is one of the worst-affected countries in the world on a per capita basis. “I come to work on the farm in the UK every year I make the money for my family.”Sakak said he was “a bit” concerned about the high rate of Covid-19 infection in the UK, but said “it will probably be the same all round the world in the end”. He added: “I come from a tranquil village in the countryside and there is no corona there.”There have been just 1,541 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 66 deaths in Bulgaria, according to John Hopkins University coronavirus research centre. That compares with 177,454 cases and 27,510 deaths in the UK.Sakak is on his way to work on a farm in Maidstone, Kent. “I work as a driver taking people to the fields to pick raspberries and strawberries,” he said. While the airport is open, it is missing the noise, queues and shopping opportunities we have come to expect when traveling. Just two flights are scheduled to arrive at Luton on Friday (both Wizz Air flights from Sofia) bringing in a few hundred passengers, which compares with a pre-pandemic average of 49,000 passengers.There is nowhere to buy a cocktail, beer or even a coffee as all the shops are shuttered. Most of the car parks are closed, but two hardy bus drivers are on hand to drive the new arrivals to Luton airport train station. Optimistic Addison Lee drivers are offering one-way fares to central London for £96.A Warwickshire farmer in the arrivals hall said he was waiting to greet seven seasonal workers hired to pick vegetables. The farmer, who declined to give his name, said that if eastern European workers did not come to work in the UK this year “acres of food will rot in the fields”. He said it had already proved much harder than usual to hire workers this season. Only four of the seven workers he was expecting arrived. Alissa Kotsant, 22, a psychology student from Ramsgate, said she had travelled to Bulgaria to see her family before the virus struck and had found herself stuck there. “There is more virus in the UK than Bulgaria, but my life is here,” she said. “I had to come back.”Kotsant said she did not feel afraid during the flight despite being closely confined with lots of other people and unable to maintain a 2-metre physical distance, as advised by the government.“It was fine,” Kotsant said. “There were no sick people on the flight, and we all wore masks. You could smell that they had just cleaned the plane.”However, neither the airline nor the airports measured passengers temperatures to check for signs of fever, a key symptom of the viral infection.Kotsant said the flight was almost full, and that Wizz Air had not restricted travel in middle seats to create more space between customers.EasyJet, Emirates and Delta have suggested they will leave middle seats empty when coronavirus travel restrictions are lifted. Ryanair has said it will not resume flights if it is unable to sell tickets for the middle seat, as it will make it much harder to turn a profit. Iata, the global airline association, expects government measures to enforce social distancing on flights.Owain Jones, the managing director of Wizz Air UK said: “As we restart selected Luton flights to provide an essential service to passengers who need to travel, our primary concern is the health, safety and well-being of our customers and crew. The protective measures that we are implementing will ensure the most sanitary conditions possible.”The airline said cabin crew are “required to wear masks and gloves and will distribute sanitising wipes to each passenger”. Wizz Air said passengers are required to wear face masks although these would only be“initially provided by Wizz Air”.The Hungarian airline, which is listed on the London stock market, is also restarting flights between Luton and Budapest, Lisbon, Tenerife, Tel Aviv and Sofia, Varna and Burgas in Bulgaria. Several of the routes are open to citizens of the destination countries only.A London Luton Airport spokesman said: “The safety of our passengers and staff is our top priority and we continue to rigorously implement all government guidance. This includes deep cleaning, the installation of sanitiser across the airport and floor markings and signage to remind customers to maintain a safe distance. We are also displaying the latest public health guidance throughout the terminal.“Air links for both passengers and freight have been recognised as essential services and the government has asked airports to remain open where possible, to ensure they can continue. The decision to operate inidual routes is a matter for each airline.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884fea00ddf1e7ed6b7390f16fef87ee2d124dc3/0_7_2758_1653/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae492019a45035ecc79694140cf8c56d","title":"cavalier tory leader botched pandemic response 1957","story":"Then, as now, a government responsible for a disaster tried to change the narrative. We shouldn’t let history repeat itselfHarold Macmillan was British prime minister from 1957 to 1963. A charming Tory with a patchy record, he’s usually remembered for saying that during his government Britons had “never had it so good” in their standard of living. What has been forgotten, almost completely, is that he said this in the middle of a pandemic.Macmillan made his claim on 20 July 1957, at a party rally in Bedford. Like Boris Johnson, he was a new premier with a preference for optimistic public statements. In 1957, the British economy was actually quite fragile, and Macmillan acknowledged this in his speech, but the idea that Tory rule kept Britain prosperous and safe was central to his premiership. As now, the party had already been in power for years, and needed to present a Labour government as a terrible risk.The pandemic, of a new strain of flu, had started in China the previous winter. During the first half of 1957 it steadily moved across Asia and then the rest of the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, to the alarm of the world’s media, including the British press. In June, the first cases appeared in Britain. Yet that month, and again in July, Macmillan’s health secretary, Dennis Vosper, refused to make a public statement setting out the threat the flu posed, arguing that it was not spreading in the UK.The government advised those with symptoms to stay at home, but otherwise took little national action as the flu spread right across the country during the autumn, instead leaving it to local medical officials to work out what to do. In some areas, schools were closed, but few sporting events or other mass gatherings were cancelled. In October, the peak of the outbreak in Britain, the Conservative party conference went ahead as usual. Macmillan’s speech didn’t mention the pandemic.Many critics of Johnson over coronavirus are hoping for a similar reckoning. The government is expecting one, too, judging by its goalpost-shifting rhetoric, such as the prime minister’s highly selective boast this week that Britain had “defied so many predictions” about the impact of the virus.But for Johnson’s critics, the fate of Macmillan’s government in the aftermath of the 1957 pandemic is not a reassuring precedent. During the later months of the crisis – not a point the government has reached yet – the Tories’ poll ratings did fall sharply. But by the time the next general election came, in 1959, the pandemic had receded. The Labour manifesto didn’t even raise the government’s handling of it. The Conservatives talked up their economic record instead, and won easily, increasing their Commons majority to 100.In Britain, it remains disconcertingly easy – and a sign of how lopsided our democracy is – for Tory governments responsible for disasters to change the subject. The rightwing bias of the press, worse now than in the 1950s, as there are fewer left-leaning papers, is the obvious villain. But equally important is a reluctance from voters to face up to the sheer scale of what the Conservatives have sometimes got wrong.The 1957 flu catastrophe came the year after the disastrous British military intervention at Suez – also under the Conservatives, and supported by Macmillan – which destroyed much of Britain’s credibility as a world power. Similarly, the British coronavirus failure closely follows the Tories’ chaotic Brexit U-turns and hugely counterproductive austerity. Yet in both eras, many voters have avoided coming to the unsettling conclusion that, quite often, their default ruling class simply isn’t up to the job. It’s more comforting to believe, as Johnson promised this week, that after its latest calamity, “the UK will emerge stronger than ever before”.Our national myth often revolves around recovery from disaster. In this narrative, failures by the state – such as the second world war setbacks that led to Dunkirk – just create opportunities for future, greater successes. As a politician preoccupied by history, and not very good at governing, Johnson understands this well. His much-admired optimism is really a form of cynicism: as he blunders through the present, he keeps the possibility of better times for Britain in the future floating perpetually in the distance, like a mirage.Can the Tories’ cynical optimism and evasions of responsibility ever be effectively pointed out? They can if Labour has a sharp enough leader. In 1957, Macmillan was mocked in parliament for his “never had it so good” speech by the shadow chancellor. With deft sarcasm, Harold Wilson called the speech “remarkable”. Wilson became Labour leader in 1963, as Macmillan’s supposed economic miracle finally petered out, and won four of the next five elections. Keir Starmer might do well to get some old tapes of him out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c43dfb32afb2e48bd468ae0d2f388b775b534e1a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cea8ae754dff61a6345117955c47d5f4","title":"young people jobless future labour employment schemes","story":"The government needs to ape Labour’s successful post-crash employment schemes and use what works to avert this crisisThis summer, new cohorts of young people will tumble out of their closed-down schools and colleges into a shut-down world of no work. Some half a million will be leaving university, as many more may be leaving school or ending training and further education to emerge into nothingness. If they have lost their entire summer term, they will have had precious little careers advice, most of which was an early victim of austerity cuts anyway. The wealth of research from previous recessions shows that a long spell of early unemployment risks people being scarred for life.Here’s a shocking fact hidden by the steep fall in unemployment figures in recent years: there were always at least 800,000 unemployed under-25s adrift – not in education, employment or training (Neets). Many have physical disabilities, illnesses and mental health problems that have been ignored. Many are part of that long tail of lost youth from addicted or violent families they are care leavers, people with no qualifications pulled into gangs and drugs, and failed by schools and underfunded social services that are unable to pick them up in time. As one employment expert said, “These were the ones we didn’t fix when the sun shone.” Instead of help, they were chased away from claiming benefits by Iain Duncan Smith’s exceptionally punitive Jobcentre-sanctioning regimes demanding they sign in every day.This week the alarm was raised by the Youth Employment Group, a new consortium including the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), the Prince’s Trust and others determined to prevent another lost generation of long-term unemployed people. Tony Wilson, director of the IES, and a former senior DWP researcher, has been watching the weekly vanishing of vacancies in horror: “They are the lowest ever, three times worse than ever before and each week it gets worse.” All sorts of jobs have gone, he says – in accountancy, finance and IT, along with the rest. In a recession, “what kills is not people losing jobs, but the lack of anyone hiring,” says Wilson.It will take a phenomenal government effort to fire up good work programmes. Already Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has talked this week of winding down the government’s furlough scheme. But what happens next to all the millions of employees who will be cast off? Young people are always at the back of the queue.Ministers have no memory: they deliberately forget anything some other government did. They prefer to reinvent wheels, marking their own thumbprint on schemes, regardless of voluminous evidence on what works. But this time, if they want to prevent unemployment armageddon, they should look back to what Labour did, both with 1997’s new deal for young people and its post-2008 crash rescue programmes. What worked was job guarantees and high-quality training, experienced advisers and subsidies to employers to hire those who were unemployed.One of the most successful was the post-crash Future Jobs Fund, a generous-spirited and popular plan. I followed its progress in detail, interviewing its beneficiaries and employers who took people on. After six months’ intensive help to find work with a personal adviser, people were offered expensive training in almost anything. If still out of work after nine months, any employer taking them on was given a subsidy of £6,500. There were strict conditions, drawn up with the CBI and TUC: no job substitution, no displacing other workers, but the creation of an extra job doing something of benefit to the community. All these Labour-era work programmes were intensively researched.The Future Jobs Fund ran for little more than a year before the Tories turned it into a 2010 election weapon. David Cameron abolished it with a flourish he said it was “expensive, badly targeted and did not work”, an example of Labour over-spending. Not so. Instead his action was an example of his government’s taste for policy-based evidence-making – pick your political policy first and invent the evidence later. Cameron didn’t bother to wait for actual results. The academic evidence supporting the programme – which involved following up all cases and control groups, tracing what became of recipients – emerged a year too late. But it showed this had been an unprecedented success that produced a net gain to the UK: compared with control groups “it had raised the number of unemployed who went into permanent work by a quarter – a phenomenal success”, says Wilson. It saved £7,750 for each participant in extra tax receipts and reduced benefit bills. There is plentiful research on other schemes, too: the successful German Kurzarbeit (“short-time work”) scheme offers a way to turn furloughing into a part-time work subsidy. Look back, too, at Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal for how governments can invest to employ: there was no lack of urgent public works after a decade of neglect. But above all learn from the best of Labour’s programmes. Rebrand them as Boris bonuses or whatever, deny their Labour origins, but use the high-grade evidence for what works to help save another generation from the lifelong damage of extensive unemployment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398f7cba9c7748958910b9caa8884c17d444e7ff/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0d67e5da8c09fc28856f42ae72840d","title":"university students have you stayed or returned to your term time address","story":"We’d like to hear from students who are returning to their university address for the start of third term, or who have remained there during lockdownAs universities prepare to enter their third term of remote teaching, some students are planning to return to their term-time home.

A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a “resort deck” featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side – known as “the Magic Carpet” – to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship’s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port.“It’s really scary, you don’t know how long it’s going to last,” says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. “When I called medical and said, ‘can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode’, they said, ‘there are people sicker than you, stay where you are’.”She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide.The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a  investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew.Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones.Upwards of 100,000 other crew members – including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex – remain trapped on their ships.Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the ’s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai.The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, according to a recording of the captain’s announcement obtained by Business Insider.In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald.Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity’s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship’s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms.The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven’t suffered higher infection rates than those on land.A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: “We have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.”The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships.Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship, the Ruby Princess, which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March, has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak – 21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus.“Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries,” said a 4 April CDC order, barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. “Outbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.”Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew, workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases.“They are basically getting no healthcare,” says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. “They are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.”Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia, meaning they pay almost no US taxes.Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which allows them to avoid strict safety standards, labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US.A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers\u0027 Federation.Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.“Foreign-flagged ships that loiter beyond US territorial seas, particularly those registered in the Bahamas” should seek assistance from the countries where they are flagged, it added.Officials in the Bahamas responded with their own memo, saying the medical system of the tiny Caribbean island nation would be overwhelmed if it had to take on caring for all those sick aboard cruise ships.“The cruise industry is facing an unprecedented crisis, and we in the Bahamas, facing the same global crisis, are doing what we can to provide support,” said the statement by the ministry of transport and local government. “Our system is not designed to deal with a massive influx of new Covid-19 patients from outside our country.”On some ships, crew members say they are being treated well, and some have been moved to passenger cabins with balconies and more space in which to spend their quarantine. Crew on the Celebrity Serenade made a parody video of their time confined to their cabins at sea. Some reported getting bonuses from their cruise lines. The Celebrity Edge, currently floating in the Bahamas, distributed a video of the ship’s captain delivering meals to the rooms of quarantined workers.On other ships, the situation is dire. Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out, and that they were forced to pay for internet time.Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line, according to letters from MSC seen by the , are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic. A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for inidual use.”A former crew member for another major cruise liner, Krista Thomas, who lives in Vancouver, has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home.She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods, and cruise ship pay – while low compared to average wages in many developed countries – is often many times higher than what they can earn at home.“They’re probably not just taking care of a wife and kids they’re taking care of parents and in-laws,” says Thomas. “They are living contract to contract to get by … They don’t want to tear the industry down. It has taken a huge hit because of what’s happened and they don’t want to see their industry fall apart.”Ross Klein, who has written books criticising the cruise industry and runs a website that reports incidents involving cruises, says crew members from developing countries “are in as close to indentured servitude as it gets”. He argues that the cruise companies bear a responsibility to care for them.“The workers are powerless,” he says. “The employers have a moral and ethical duty to care for these people they brought from around the world. There have got to be ways to work out a solution to get these people safely home.”Alexandra Nedeltcheva, still experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19, has had to pay for an Airbnb to quarantine near her home in Bulgaria, so she doesn’t expose her family. She still worries about her friends aboard the Celebrity Apex in Saint-Nazaire in France. There, as of 14 April, two workers remained hospitalised with severe Covid-19 and 700 crew were still working or isolating, according to a report by a French TV station.Nedeltcheva says she has enjoyed seeing the world in her 11 years working with Celebrity Cruises, but the treatment she says crew have received during the pandemic has opened her eyes.“I really want something to change,” she says. “They can take much better care of their crew. It’s time the cruising industry does better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf8bf0936865eb39ba9e26519c988ee35c2a62e/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ee1859739d864151fde01e8f70c035a 480w","title":"cinemas in sweden remain open coronavirus pandemic","story":"Many of the country’s movie theatres have continued to operate despite alarming death toll, with social distancing measures in placeShowing a film in a cinema has become an act of political consequence. Movie theatres across the globe, from China to the US, have shut down during the coronavirus pandemic, and arguments have broken out, as much on ideological lines as economic, as to how and when to reopen. In Sweden, however, some have remained open all along, operating under new government guidelines. With 47 cinemas and about 200 screens, the country’s second-largest chain Svenska Bio stayed operational – and as a result has become Europe’s biggest operator by box office revenue.Fornstam has been both lauded and reviled for keeping his cinemas open – even more since the biggest cinema chain in Sweden, Filmstaden, closed theirs. The 65-year-old takes a long view. “Swedes … there used to be a joke that if every Swede were told to have a blue and a yellow sock, nobody would question the decision but they would question if the colour of the sock could cause cancer,” he says. “The government said we should do this. So we’ll do this. We can stick to the rules. Also, there are physical and mental issues to deal with, so we try to keep everyone going.”Forstam’s position is in keeping with Sweden’s more liberal response to the pandemic. While its neighbours Denmark, Finland and Norway went into various versions of lockdown, Sweden closed high schools and universities but allowed kindergartens and primaries to remain open. Theatres, museums and sporting arenas were closed, restaurants remained open. The government said that if social distancing rules are not followed, offending businesses would be shut down. The country has faced heavy criticism from scientists as it recorded a far higher death rate than its neighbours, with Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, saying that “there is a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies”.However, the Swedish model has been hailed by conservatives in the US – without understanding, according Lars Trägårdh, a history professor at Ersta Sköndal Bräcke University College, that it depends on the population’s compliance with, and trust in, the state. “It is interesting to see that the Swedish stress on what we call ‘freedom under responsibility’ is getting picked up by the libertarian right in the US. The big problem with all of that is that Sweden is all built, ultimately, on a very strong alliance between the state and the inidual.” Swedes, in effect, follow the recommendations of authorities. Swedish-American journalist Erik Augustin Palm went even further in an article in Slate, citing Sweden’s peculiar cultural attributes such as “unbounded trust in state experts and an internalised sense of exceptionalism” as contributing factors to the belief that the government knows what it’s doing. “It is still possible that Sweden’s Covid-19 response could be exonerated – say, herd immunity does take effect and Sweden’s death rate is lower than neighbouring countries’ at some point … This seems highly unlikely, but still possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a47af3134c4254cfa1c18e0787f3497e84a3237/0_42_4788_2872/master/4788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d5fd103b10f175499b023b1bca317e","title":"gael garcia bernal the pandemic has taught me that i need something to say","story":"He’s played a revolutionary hero, a horny teen – now Gael García Bernal is a reptilian choreographer in Ema, and locked down in Mexico city. Just don’t ask him to move to LA when all this is overAt the start of the century, the director Alfonso Cuarón was casting Y Tu Mamá También, the bawdy but plangent road movie he had written with his brother Carlos about two oversexed Mexican teenagers, the wealthy Tenoch and his poorer, grungier friend Julio. “Alfonso called me very excitedly,” recalls Carlos Cuarón. “He said: ‘I know who’s going to play Julio! I’ve seen him in Alejandro’s movie.’” Alejandro González Iñárritu, that is, whose ferocious dog-fighting drama Amores Perros was about to be released. “I said: ‘No, no, I’ve found Julio I saw the perfect actor in this short film, De Tripas, Corazón. He’s incredible: his eyes, the way he manages silence ...’”Eventually, the brothers realised they were talking about the same person: Gael García Bernal, who was then just 21. The son of theatre actors, he had become a star in his early teens on the Mexican soap opera El Abuelo y Yo (Grandpa and I) before decamping to London to study at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Iñárritu plucked him out mid-term for Amores Perros and he stole that movie as the twitchy-hipped tearaway who was every bit as feral as his champion rottweiler. His mutable features could switch from cherubic to lupine to gravely smouldering his nerve endings felt exposed like frayed electrical wires.“You can feel all his emotions, all his vulnerability,” says Cuarón. “He fills the screen completely. After my wife met him, she said: ‘Wow, he’s so handsome, but I thought he would be tall.’ He’s like Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman, the kind of actor whose aura and energy makes you think they’re huge.”In that wham-bam first half-decade of Bernal’s film career, he gave four killer performances, any one of which would have been enough to build a reputation on: Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También, Pedro Almodóvar’s Bad Education, part of which he spent looking ravishing in drag, and The Motorcycle Diaries, in which he played a young Che Guevara. Now 41, Bernal has alternated between mainstream projects in the US – such as his five-year stint as an eccentric conductor in the delightful Amazon series Mozart in the Jungle, or his touching voice work as a balladeer trapped in the afterlife in the Disney Pixar gem Coco – and politically charged work in Latin America.When he calls me today, it is from Mexico City, one of two locations that is home to him (the other is Buenos Aires) and where he happened to be when the lockdown began. “What’s beautiful right now in Mexico,” he says brightly, “is that straight after the daily 7pm press conference, there are films on TV from the golden age of Mexican cinema, from the 1930s to the 1950s. It’s been wonderful to watch them in this light. I see the hopes of the actors and film-makers from 70 or 80 years ago. I see their fears, their experiments, what they were trying to build and express. I find it all incredibly moving as a document of humanity.”He thinks the current crisis is altering for ever the way we look at art. “There’s something more straightforward now in how we see things – it’s stronger, more elemental and pulsating. We’re so emotionally charged. Artistic expression can affect us for the better, making us feel we’re all in this questioning together.”It is, he suggests, an ideal state in which to approach Ema, his third film with the Chilean director Pablo Larraín, following No, about the 1988 plebiscite on Pinochet, and the fantasy-biopic Neruda, in which he played a police inspector who doubts his own existence. Ema is the pair’s most challenging collaboration, populated largely by destructive and dislikable characters only gradually do their prickly exteriors peel away to reveal the wounded souls within. Bernal has the small but pivotal role of Gastón, a choreographer married to the dancer Ema (Mariana Di Girolamo). He is plainly callous – he taunts her over their recent failed adoption of a seven-year-old boy – but Bernal shows that Gastón is suffering, too.“There is something about the nature of his job that makes him feel very lonely. That was interesting to explore: he’s the centre of gravity at this dance company, he puts everything together, and that leads to a lot of loneliness. It’s like directing a film, which is a solitary pursuit even though it’s collective.” Bernal himself has directed two features – the 2007 drama Déficit and the as-yet-unreleased Chicuarotes, about young Mexican hoodlums – as well as founding, with his childhood friend and Y Tu Mamá También co-star Diego Luna, two production companies and a documentary film festival, Ambulante.So could Gastón be a portrait of himself or Larraín? “No, not at all!” he laughs. “But Pablo and I both understand him in his isolation and his stupefaction.” Perhaps, then, he is comparable to Rodrigo, the conductor from Mozart in the Jungle, who is also a restless, demanding creative type? “Yes! Except that Rodrigo represents happiness and adventure, whereas Gastón is the opposite. Rodrigo is Maradona. Gastón is more like Mike Tyson.”His role in Ema is notable for keeping his usual electrifying charm in check if Gastón is sexual, it is only in the most remote, reptilian way. Such unpalatable parts are rare on Bernal’s CV. In Fernando Meirelles’s Blindness, he played an unscrupulous bartender taking advantage of an epidemic that renders its sufferers sightless in one scene, he performed a head-waggling, bad-taste version of I Just Called to Say I Love You. And in The King, his English-language debut from 2005, he was a psychopath calmly wreaking revenge on his long-lost father.“Gael had balls, to be blunt,” says James Marsh, that picture’s British director. “We went to quite a few up-and-coming young American actors, some of whom have big careers now, and none of them would go near that script. But Gael liked the idea of playing someone with this cold surface. I love way he moves in the film: he’s always slinking around, more animal than human. The character has pure evil in him, but he played it in this blank way so that you didn’t hate him.”Nor, by the end of Larraín’s picture, do we hate Gastón. Whether we understand him is another matter, one that Bernal thinks may not be so important. “That’s always the dilemma, right? Understanding. What the hell does it mean? There is that saying. I think it was Picasso, no? Someone said they didn’t understand his work. So he asked them: ‘You like eating eggs in the morning? You like your huevos rotos?’ ‘Yeah, I like them.’ ‘OK. But do you understand them?’” He chuckles at that.It is better, he says, for the audience to “know that they don’t know” the character’s motivations. “That’s the journey you embark on when you’re building a character. Little by little, the pieces come together. OK, how would this character feel in the rain? What would he do outside? And you start to discover them. Playing Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, there came a point where I could improvise a whole day of his life. I had that ownership of what he would do in any situation. That’s the nirvana of acting: being able to go into places where you’re not sure what the hell is going to happen.”Saffron Burrows, one of Bernal’s co-stars on Mozart in the Jungle, witnessed his process up close. “There’s this incredible ease about Gael,” she tells me. “One thing that was so enjoyable was his improvising, the little riffs he developed, the surprises. Every take was very different. I think he works far harder than one would imagine. Sometimes we’d be doing the same scene for nine hours and I’d see him mulling, working stuff out, honing it.” She and Bernal go way back: they starred together as honeymooners in David Nicholls’s short play Aftersun, staged at the Old Vic in 2005.Burrows even recalls frequenting the bar where he worked while he was a drama student in the late 90s. “I used to go bobbing about with friends at this Cuban place in Islington where he was the barman. He’s had that London training and he’s always carried this internationalism about him. He’s very welcoming. When we were making Mozart, he was always at the helm, always being the host.”Although necessarily remote as Gastón, he does get to reveal the character’s churning inner turmoil during a frantic speech railing against his wife’s lifestyle. “There are some opinions he has which I share,” Bernal says. “When he mocks the idea of going to Los Angeles and taking selfies, for instance. I would say there is no bigger treason for humankind. It’s throwing your life away. I know it sounds horrible. But going to Los Angeles and taking selfies serves absolutely no transcendent purpose!”Bernal resisted that city’s siren call even before he and his former partner, the Argentine actor Dolores Fonzi, had two children: a son, Lázaro, now 11, and a daughter, Libertad, who is nine. He stayed put. “Not because I didn’t want to take selfies! There are just so many stories I wanted to tell. I wanted to change things with my own hands, not follow someone else’s route.”Marsh thinks that Bernal’s integrity is vital to his acting. “I have enormous respect for him and how he refused to take the easy path. He could easily have gone to Hollywood and become Antonio Banderas, but he didn’t. He’s stretched himself and matured into a great artist.” Cuarón, who went on to direct Bernal and Luna in the football saga Rudo y Cursi, agrees. “Gael and Diego are the most respected actors of their generation in Mexico. He’s involved with social issues like immigration, and he’s very outspoken politically. He is both criticised and celebrated, depending on who is in government here. And though he has lived everywhere, he has never left Mexico or stopped being involved in Mexican issues.”Even noble, conscientious actors are only human. Has he ever taken any roles purely for the money? “Oh, there have been one or two,” the actor says ruefully. I invite him to name and shame them, but he declines with a giggle: “Noooo!” So let’s just say it is oddly comforting that even a performer as good as he is can still make films as poor as Letters to Juliet, where he played Amanda Seyfried’s insufferable boyfriend, or A Little Bit of Heaven, in which he was an oncologist who falls for Kate Hudson as she dies photogenically and at great length.“I did certain projects I wasn’t too sure of,” he admits. “Sometimes there would be a pleasant surprise, sometimes a very bad one where I’d think: ‘It’s not worth it, man. What am I doing?’ If this pandemic has made me learn one thing, it is that I have to work less. I need to nurture and have something to say.”So he’s not going to do another film he doesn’t believe in? “I think so, yeah. It’s a commonplace thing to say. But now, thanks to this situation, it’s even more acute, right? I’m just going to do what I like. I’m going to be stricter about that from now on.”Ema is available on free preview on 1 May, and then normally on Mubi from 2 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2641979668ce6ece6b3c71f63c9f944dcd32049f/123_3_1842_1106/master/1842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8636336a8be63eb87a5177ad9935e21","title":"ive never seen solaris andrei tarkovsky film","story":"Tarkovsky’s mysterious epic – a response to the ‘phoniness’ of 2001: A Space Odyssey – draws you into its melancholic dreamworld superblyAt university in the early 90s, friends who were studying philosophy would enthuse about Solaris in the same smoke-filled breath as Hegel and Sartre – neither of whom I had read. But I felt at ease with nerdiness, in a room crowded with techno music and people lying about on the floor. Vicariously I became a purist, without ever watching the 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky nor reading the original novel by Stanisław Lem. And when Steven Soderbergh’s slicker, shorter, altogether shinier adaptation, starring George Clooney and Natasha McElhone, was released, I knowingly let it pass me by – why have Hollywood cotton when you could have Soviet silk? So it has taken me more than 25 years and the lockdown of a global pandemic to make time for Tarkovsky’s film, only to find that the more you attempt to understand Solaris, the more it defies explanation.Generations of scientists have risked their sanity trying to make sense of its sprawling ocean, a vast living organism that appears to be sentient none has succeeded. The doomed hero of this story is Kris Kelvin (played by Donatas Banionis), a psychologist and expert in the field of Solaristics, who is dispatched to the station that orbits the planet to evaluate whether or not the troubled mission should continue. Its dwindling crew is under siege from mysterious figures – phantasmic incarnations of their own shameful memories and fantasies that seem to have risen up from the depths of the sea. Kelvin is greeted by devastation: his colleague Dr Gibarian has killed himself, while the other cosmonauts – Snaut and Sartorius – are hiding away in their cabins. The “visitor” that will drive Kelvin to the edge of madness is a simulacrum of his lost love, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who killed herself long ago. He awakes in a dream to find her sitting before him – and so the living nightmare begins.Or, at least, this is where the film really gets going. Departing from the book, Tarkovsky opens on Earth. Entrancing images of the natural world – a leaf carried downstream, weeds undulating in the dark depths of a brook, thistles veiled in light mist – are set to the melancholic sound of an organ work by Bach (a musical embodiment of order, religious faith and reason) as Kelvin contemplates the garden at his family home. It is an exquisite conjuring of the universe he is preparing to leave behind, as well as a vision of lost childhood that reproduces the house the director grew up in. Tarkovsky is on home ground, then, yet uncannily so, as home, in that disturbing Wizard of Oz way, becomes somewhere yearned for, yet forever beyond reach.A similar meditation on nature occurs in Tarkovsky’s later science fiction film, Stalker, a journey through a post-apocalyptic wasteland called the “Zone” in search of a mythical house of dreams. And perhaps it was the remnants of the industrial landscape from that film that made me imagine the characters of Solaris would be trapped between brutalist grey walls in a dystopian black-and-white vision of solitude. We do get stark white interiors when Kelvin arrives in space, but this vision of the future is not so distant from the film’s present he wears the same clothes he wore on Earth – a leather jacket and T-shirt (that bears an unfortunate passing resemblance to a string vest) – while his pyjamas really are monogrammed. Mirrors in each room reflect the cosmonaut’s journey into his interior world. Objects are imbued with memories: Bruegel’s The Hunters in the Snow hangs on the wood-panelled walls of the library, recalling the cold comforts of the earthly landscape he’s left behind.But return to that moment when the narrator, Kelvin, meets Hari in the book: “My first thought was: ‘I’m glad this is one of those dreams where you know you’re dreaming.’ All the same, I’d preferred her not to be there. I closed my eyes and began to wish this intensely, but when I opened them again she was still sitting there.” What I love is the way in which the film captures this merging of dreams and the waking world. Emerging eerily out of silence, the ambient sounds of Eduard Artemyev’s electronic score echo the warm glow of red sunlight that floods the room and catches soft hairs lining the contours of Hari’s face.Elsewhere, surreal happenings (a dwarf’s darting out from Sartorious’s cabin as he guards his door) or telling inconsistencies (the lack of fastener on Hari’s dress) go unexplained, occurring naturally within the rhythm and pace of an elliptical chain of events. As the camera slowly pans in long takes, characters that disappear from one point of view seem to occupy an entirely different space when seen from another, creating the effect of a lucid dream in which the camera is at once observing and determining the narrative. Bondarchuk is disconcertingly blank-faced and willing as she relives the traumatic loops of obsessive love that destroyed her Banionis convincingly carries the burden of guilt of a man whose first desperate attempt to get rid of the problem involves folding her into a rocket and launching her into space. Relating was clearly never his strong point.But what to make of it all? I’m still none the wiser. Tarkovsky set out to expose the “phoniness” of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey with this interrogation of the human condition and the result is a strange kind of psychological horror. The vividly coloured and intricately textured forms of Lem’s majestically rendered ocean – so profoundly unsettling in the novel – are almost an afterthought here. Soderbergh’s sea at least gives off a nice CGI shimmer in a telling that ticks off Lem’s underlying philosophical queries with impressive efficiency. (Questions of faith, the existence of God and the limitations of human understanding are raised and dealt with in the exchanges of a 30-second dinner party conversation.) But, in the absence of CGI, and a musical score that tells you how to feel, Tarkovsky’s dreamworld draws you in you don’t need an ocean to sense a world at sea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02834a48bf272110f6e7db45a9b3eff5f582a48/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03060aa59b8db650656975f3523f09a4","title":"tell us about your ultimate holiday food recipe","story":"We want to know the recipe you use to recreate the experience of food, freedom and funWith holidays on hold for the foreseeable and cooking a rare lockdown joy, your culinary repertoire can be easily expanded by recalling dishes that bring back memories of happier times on trips away.

Now, considering whether to play professional football in the middle of a pandemic is literally a matter of life and death.One of football’s perennial failings is to inflate its obsession into a bubble in which the great game’s dramas, outcomes, personalities and controversies seal it off into an alternative world which can feel somehow as significant as everything else. Hearing Boris Johnson mention “our current success” in dealing with coronavirus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, deny that allowing the virus to run through the population and achieve “herd immunity” was ever “part of their plan” and the refusal by the government to admit to a single failure, they often appear to be creating a bubble of their own.For people not in the front line of the NHS or caring professions, and not stricken personally by the virus, lockdown can make the horror of this situation feel unreal. But 27,000 people in the UK have died, each one a tragedy and grievous blow to a family.Into the second week in March, Dowden and his government were still encouraging people to go to matches and the Cheltenham Festival, based on scientists’ advice that “mass gatherings” pose a low risk of virus transmission. Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College explained that with reference to the Liverpool v Atlético Madrid match played on 11 March. “Some people will have got infected,” he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, “and if it hadn’t happened they wouldn’t have been.” But he went on to explain that “at a population level, stopping them has a marginal impact”.But in normal circumstances we do not think of a risk to some lives as “marginal” because they are not many as a proportion of the whole population normally everything is aimed at saving and preserving life. Most of the talk in football now is about how players and staff could be tested, somehow housed in a sterile environment, how they might ingeniously be tiptoed into empty stadiums while the rest of the population are still largely housebound. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, was criticised by the club itself for raising public health concerns about games restarting, but however in-depth the planning may be to avoid people massing outside the stadium or gathering instinctively to celebrate, he was sounding a genuine alarm about risks.To be balanced against those lethal hazards are the benefits of trying so hard to stage matches again. As seven weeks have gone by since football suspended itself on 13 March, against the advice of Dowden and his government that it was fine to carry on into that weekend, the significance of promotion, relegation and Champions League qualification has been put into perspective by the pandemic’s elemental threat. Now the urge to play is articulated more as a grim job of having to get the season done to avoid difficult conversations with broadcasters, and be able to keep their money.After Dowden spoke up in parliament, more than one senior football executive told the  this week they felt uneasy, as if the government needs some good news, some entertainment for the masses, and that lies behind their desire to get the Premier League playing “as soon as possible”. Dowden said in parliament that this would “help release resources through the rest of the system”, but the EFL is understood to be baffled by that, as no more money will go down the football pyramid now if the Premier League starts playing again.In France, where the number of people killed by Covid-19 is lower than in Britain, the government has banned team sports until September and, however much the odd club such as Lyon may grumble, Ligue 1 is cancelled, and the summer is cleared of yet another complication, to try to address the virus. If that were to happen here, however much football people are missing the game and would love current realities to be different, many people could usefully calm down.The financial situation, of course difficult, will probably be just about manageable. If that did happen, the Premier League could concentrate on being true to the principle it has stressed throughout and did again on Friday: “The thoughts of all are with those directly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” and: “The Premier League’s priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones.

With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

A verified account for him also remained on Twitter, which said it was prioritising the removal of Covid-19 content when it had a call to action that could potentially cause harm.The move by Facebook came ahead of a call by an anti-hate group, the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), for social networks to remove Icke from their platforms. It was backed by figures including the doctors and broadcasters Christian Jessen, Dawn Harper and Pixie McKenna.It also comes against the backdrop of attacks on mobile phone masts across the UK and elsewhere at a time amid concern about the impact of baseless theories linking coronavirus to 5G networks.A report by the CCDH claims that Icke’s conspiracies about coronavirus have been viewed more than 30m times. Based on an analysis of videos that feature Icke speaking about the coronavirus on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, the group described him as the leading producer of misinformation on Covid-19.Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said that Facebook must now look at what he described as a vast network of pages and groups in which Icke’s content was being shared.“While people around the world make enormous sacrifices to stall this pandemic, social media firms are instead profiting from the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms,” he said.“Misinformation puts all of our lives at risk by encouraging the public not to comply with clinical guidance.The action against Icke’s social media presence was also welcomed by Hope Not Hate, which said: “Icke’s deluded, often antisemitic, posts encourage harmful lies to spread.

The journalist in question has now resigned from the company.“The FT wishes to apologise to the Independent and the Evening Standard, which subsequently informed the FT that the same reporter had accessed a meeting it had held.”Di Stefano’s actions raised questions about whether or not he had broken the law, given the meetings were not password protected.Christopher Hutchings, a lawyer at Hamlins who has dealt with a number of phone hacking cases, says “Zoombombing” could be in breach of the Computer Misuse Act and data protection and privacy laws.Di Stefano’s actions were in breach of the FT’s code of conduct, which states: “The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by … intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails.

It was prepared as a background document, intended to be submitted alongside Labour’s response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into the party.When Labour’s lawyers decided the document should not be submitted, it was leaked. Starmer said at the time he was “shocked” by its contents, and by the fact that it had been published. His handling of the sensitive issue is regarded by both sides of the party as an early test of his leadership.In addition to Forde, the panellists will be three Labour peers: Debbie Wilcox, a former leader of Newport city council Larry Whitty, a former Labour party general secretary, and Ruth Lister, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University.Some leftwing NEC members objected to the makeup of the panel. They argued for the veteran campaigner Lord Dubs, who is Jewish, to be included – but were defeated 18-16 in a vote.A spokesperson for Momentum said: “It is critical that the inquiry focus on the very serious allegations of racism, sexism, senior staff members trying to sabotage Labour’s 2017 general election campaign and a failure to pursue antisemitism cases.“In any other organisation, members accused of racism, sexism and misuse of funds would be suspended pending investigation. Labour should be no different, and we call on Labour to suspend those named in the report while the investigation is ongoing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593eea3f9bd7f5555e6250322426627831519de3/0_102_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc3aefb0bdb88ab8307feb105de70f73","title":"labour keir starmer coronavirus covid 19 new era","story":"Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinet opt against open hostility with No 10 over coronavirus strategyLabour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, gave members of his fresh frontbench team some gentle advice when he began chairing shadow cabinet meetings by videoconference last month: you don’t have to speak for the sake of it.While Jeremy Corbyn’s consensual chairing style involved hearing lengthy contributions from colleagues with contrasting views, Starmer reminds shadow ministers they shouldn’t feel obliged to chip in.With the nation gripped by the Covid-19 crisis, he has taken an equally restrained approach to Labour’s contribution to the national debate – to varying reviews from those on his own side.“Our pragmatic decision is, first of all to engage on the practical things the government could do that would make people’s lives easier,” says Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary.But while his supporters have applauded Starmer’s approach and argued that a more aggressive line will simply alienate the public at a time of high government popularity, Labour leftwingers have been frustrated at the party’s refusal to seize on the crisis as a moment to propose a radical overhaul of the economy and society.Jon Trickett, now relegated to the backbenches from his position of shadow cabinet office minister, says: “The country’s crying out for a longer-term vision. We need to map out a great vision for the kind of new normal that can exist after this pandemic. Perhaps the leadership doesn’t feel now’s the right time to do that.”The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Reynolds says those are arguments Labour can make later. For now, the priority is pressing for urgent assistance for struggling households and families. “I’m very sympathetic to UBI, but realistically you’ve got to use the channels we’ve got,” he says.“The fact that we have come out with pragmatic suggestions of how to help people right now, does not take away from the fact that we want and are committed to a full alternative to universal credit: we want to work with people and build a big coalition around that.That approach has been replicated across the shadow cabinet.Annaliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has praised the chancellor’s economic rescue schemes but pointed out the gaps in them. And Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, has lauded frontline police officers but demanded more action to protect domestic violence victims.Labour believes this is what the public expects of the official opposition at a time of national crisis.Starmer held the first two of a string of planned “Call Keir” virtual meetings, with voters from Bury and the Tees Valley this week.These meetings, and polling seen by Labour strategists, are telling them the public don’t want to hear knee-jerk criticism of the government. “The approach we’re getting from the public is, ‘All of us need to be together, getting through this,’” said a party source.They also say the public believe the right time to challenge the government’s handling of the outbreak head-on will be after the worst has passed – though Starmer has stepped up his attacks in the past week, telling Johnson the UK had been slow into lockdown, and now risks “falling behind the rest of the world”.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth – one of the few frontbenchers to remain in the same job when Starmer took over – has been praised by Matt Hancock for his constructive approach but his frustration with the government’s stance also appeared to bubble over this week.Ashworth has been calling for the test-and-track approach now being pursued by Hancock for some time – and believes the health secretary should have started much earlier to recruit the necessary army of contact-tracers he has now acknowledged will be needed.“This lockdown is not a strategy in itself to defeat the virus,” Ashworth told the . “This lockdown buys us time to put in place a strategy. And my big fear is that in the same way they failed to prepare the testing we needed, and they failed to prepare the PPE for frontline staff, it looks like they are failing to prepare the tracing capacity we need.”Most of Starmer’s frontbench team have been in contact with their Conservative opposite numbers, and the shadow cabinet are receiving briefings from relevant civil servants.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, says that while they don’t want to “bombard” the civil service, “it’s our job as an opposition to be constructively critical”.And Reynolds says these private conversations are no substitute for asking a question publicly, in parliament – even virtually.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 201415, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Boris Johnson briefed Starmer directly this week, as part of what the prime minister claimed was part his effort to “build the biggest possible consensus,” for how to manage the next phase of the crisis.Both sides insist that falls far short of coopting Labour into decision-making, however, with Starmer’s team regarding chatter about a “national government” as a Westminster bubble fantasy.﻿When Johnson returned to the Downing Street press conference on Thursday, he appeared to reflect Labour’s repeated recent calls for an “exit strategy”, avoiding the phrase repeatedly used by Starmer but promising a “road map” and a “menu of options”.Speaking afterwards, Starmer made clear he felt vindicated. “I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I’m pleased that we’re going to see a plan, we’ll look at it when we see it, but it’s a step in the right direction.”With Corbyn watching from high above him on the backbenches, Starmer used a telling phrase at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, to describe how he sees his own approach – and which helps explain his caution. “I try to be careful to stick to the data and the evidence, rather than just coming up with an opinion,” he told Dominic Raab."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056e89f4217902ea1a711b2cd9b480d4e6ef1bd0/0_80_6220_3732/master/6220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7889b5392a64e76a4aa5e96234b62c2","title":"cholera and coronavirus why we must not repeat the same mistakes","story":"Cholera has largely been beaten in the west, but it still kills tens of thousands of people in poorer countries every year. As we search for a cure for coronavirus, we have to make sure it will be available to everyone, not just to those in wealthy nations. By  Neil SinghWe log in every day at 7.45am. One by one, we join an array of faces on our screens. We doctors aren’t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing – all of which are changing every day.But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them – not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years’ time.For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.To reach my grandparents’ house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region’s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area’s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits – mangoes, lychees and guava – that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old inscription at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the clinical picture of patients afflicted by severe cholera: “The lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.”In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don’t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that ided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called Isabella Hazard. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly.It is hard to imagine the panic created by the “Blue Death”, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory – that the disease was associated with “bad airs” (or “miasmas”) – inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets “to destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys”.So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing millions of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary Mario Adorno accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting “a devilish plot bent on poisoning the people” of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them.But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive – they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by “miasmas”. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a dot map of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same water pump on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.John Snow’s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.In Florence, a contemporary of Snow’s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.Pacini recognised that these dots – which he called “vibrios” (commas), because of their shape – must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.Pacini had discovered the “germ”, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, Hemanda Nath Chatterjee developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.Six years later, Sambhu Nath De discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed – like whole spices – even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.Today, it’s easy for westerners to get their hands on the most effective vaccine, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It’s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will protect you for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don’t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the average Indian farmer would have to work for three whole days.There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That’s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes – the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera’s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De’s seminal research, a new pandemic – the seventh – sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, inidual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first International Sanitary Conference, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.According to Anne-Emanuelle Birn, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the WHO.Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated – not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, cholera claimed more lives than the coronavirus. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.A map of the places still struggling with cholera shows 47 countries – in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer have shown, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates – despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on another nearby island, Ebeye. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to nine people, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.There are fears that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the four endemic coronaviruses or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world’s poorest regions.The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global ides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries buying up so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers to the outsourcing of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world’s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the digital infrastructure necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, has compared the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls “Global Health 4.0”: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump’s removal of funding, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone’s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam has written that “enormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability”. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a “communitarian globalism”: a bottom-up approach, “based on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources”. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the communist government in Kerala giving food and shelter to migrant workers to the Somalian doctors offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy to Cuba allowing an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years’ time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f34cc9bb1272664d8997159b7a3ef65fb1e379/0_197_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ff199f2bb6c6a619e22d6a506b22a15","title":"mlb nba nhl return coronavirus testing","story":"Politicians, players and owners are trying to figure out a way to get baseball, basketball and hockey going again, not only for economic reasons but as a welcome ersion for a social distancing nation facing uncertain times.But to do so would require commandeering thousands of test kits each week for millionaire pro athletes and support staff, something many view as unseemly, especially when ordinary Americans are waiting in line.Leagues know it would be a terrible look for them to jump the testing line. Acutely aware of the potential backlash, commissioners and owners are saying that, until the public has more access to testing, they don’t want to secure tests for players. The NBA even told teams in a memo Thursday that it would be inappropriate to test asymptomatic players and coaches for now – but the league does expect to have testing available when it’s time to return to practices and games.The NBA plans to allow teams to reopen some facilities on 8 May but only for voluntary workouts and in cities where local governments allow. And there is no timetable yet for a return to practices and games, in large part because the testing issue remains unsolved.“We would have to ensure that testing is widely available and front-line health care workers have access before we begin talking about regular testing in the context of professional sports,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass said.President Donald Trump wants sports back for both economic and morale reasons, knowing that once games start getting played again, Americans will have something to cheer for whether fans are in the stands or not. Sports leaders have met with the White House multiple times to discuss that goal. Trump has been told testing availability is critical to any restart plans, a person with direct knowledge of those talks told the Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because few details of the conversations were to be publicly shared.“I don’t want people to get used to this because this virus is going to be gone,” Trump said in a White House coronavirus briefing. “And when it’s gone, you want to get back to normal.”Harvard researchers say the US should be testing at least a half-million people daily, while the White House estimates about 200,000 tests are being administered each day.Some teams were sharply criticized for getting their players tested when the pandemic was beginning to take hold in March. The leagues want to avoid a similar blowback.“The threshold question is the health question. That’s where we’re spending the most time,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. “The ones that are the most worrisome are the ones that are beyond their control.”According to Major League Baseball, 3,000 kits would need to be available for players, staff, broadcasters and others for every round of testing to get its season going and keep it going. Even if the NHL and NBA return with just 16 postseason teams on the ice and courts, those leagues would likely require tests for a minimum of 1,000 players and staff. And there’s no telling how often Daily? Every few days? Weekly? the tests would be required to be administered.With tests still in short supply, that’s not a great look.Some health care officials have said an equally problematic issue is a shortfall of personal protective equipment – masks, gowns, gloves and the like – that are needed by the people tasked with administering the tests.“We don’t want to use a disproportionate number of testing resources if it’s limited,” NFL lead counsel Jeff Pash said. “We want to make sure that we’re testing people in an appropriate way if we do it and have clear and consistent standards. I think that we very much would take our guidance on that from the medical and public health experts.”Dr Rebekah Gee, Louisiana’s former health secretary and CEO of Louisiana State University’s health services ision, said reopening of sports should not be considered until the country gets a handle on the sickest people through testing and contact tracing.“I’m a huge (New Orleans) Saints fan and I want to go to the Superdome too,” Gee said. “But am I willing to risk my life for this? No, I’m not. We’ve got to be smart and shouldn’t be giving people false reassurances.”The PGA Tour said it is reviewing what it will need from a testing standpoint before its scheduled return to play without fans in June. Nascar is returning later this month, also without fans – and without Covid-19 testing. Temperatures of everyone accessing the track will be taken and other strict precautions will be in place, but for now coronavirus tests are not part of the restart plans.The NBA, NHL and MLB likely won’t have that luxury, for the simple fact that athletes in those sports are often in extremely close contact with one another during play.“Those tests remain in short supply,” Nascar vice president of racing operations John Bobo said. “Getting results can take two to three days. Really, those tests should be targeted for people most in need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d41cb59cce045667a75f6e619fdf6cb225da581a/0_32_1646_987/master/1646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6771d77993a5a92964e45e327d883c72","title":"sixers lakers 2001 nba finals","story":"No athlete has ever embodied my hometown’s underdog spirit more entirely than AI on the night he led the Sixers to a famous upset of the seemingly invincible LakersThe 2001 Philadelphia 76ers are a tall tale that only grows unlikelier with time. The premise flatly stated is absurd: the Sixers built a ballclub around a 5ft 11in delinquent from Virginia Beach and it worked. Allen Iverson became the least conventional star ever to lead a team to the NBA finals and the Sixers became the ultimate underdog squad for the ultimate underdog city.From almost the day he arrived in my hometown aged 20, Iverson was plainly one of the NBA’s most transcendent talents, whose scoring instinct was amplified by a new-generation, kill-your-idols edge. His was the perfect game for the teenagers we were: reckless, almost violent, crackling with anarchic energy. It quickly became the greatest show in sports and it was happening right in our backyard. AI was just cool as shit. The whole city loved him. He was a singular but flawed talisman: who could win games by himself but refused to lift or do any real treatment, blew off practice because he was hungover, cursed out the coach and all but begged to be kicked off the team.Yet Iverson’s preposterous feats of bravery – watching him throw his 160lb frame into the paint, carom off the elbows of linebacker-sized defenders, score a bucket and then bounce off the deck to do it again – were his nightly penance and absolution for more than a decade. If clean-cut superstars like Jordan and Kobe strived to embody the (false) ideal of perfection, Iverson unapologetically spoke to the frailties innate in us. He was beloved because he was fallible.No team before or since has ever made a player that little the focal point and understandably so deep down we knew the blueprint was doomed. But in 2001, it all came together. The concept was simple: the Sixers surrounded Iverson with selfless role players who wouldn’t get pissed the smallest guy on the court was chucking up 30 shots a night, their names familiar only because most were on their third or fourth team.The Sixers were given no chance in the finals against the seemingly invincible Los Angeles Lakers, the in-form defending champions led by Shaq and Kobe who hadn’t lost in more than two months. Even at full strength Philadelphia would have had their hands full, but the depleted Mash unit that arrived at the Staples Center for Game 1 of the series was written off entirely.The Lakers immediately showed why, rattling off 16 unanswered points behind the most physically fearsome big man in NBA history at his elemental peak. But after a patchy start Iverson caught fire, slashing and careening to the goal in transition, effortlessly shedding his perimeter defenders out of half-court sets and silencing the Hollywood plastics at courtside. By intermission he’d poured in 30, five off Jordan’s finals record for points in a half, as the Sixers built a lead that would swell to 73-58 in the third quarter.After watching Iverson shred Kobe and Derek Fisher for the first half hour, the Lakers looked way down the bench to Tyronn Lue, the seldom-used point guard who had spent the run-up mimicking Iverson against the Lakers’ first team in practice. Lue harried and hounded Philadelphia’s star relentlessly, denying him the ball or forcing him into contested jumpers. Whether borne from tactical genius or desperation, it was working.With Iverson in check, Shaq at his unstoppable best and my entire city hanging on every loose ball and rebound, the Lakers chipped away and sent the game to overtime. Then comes the part everyone remembers.The Sixers are clinging to a two-point lead with about a minute to go when Iverson receives a pass near the corner. He hesitates a half-beat, as if to assess his prey, before crossing over Lue and lofting a stepback jumper that hangs in the air for what seems like ages before ripping through the net, punctuating the coup de grâce with an exaggerated high-step over his fallen foil. Forty-eight points, five rebounds, six assists and five steals. Sixers take Game 1, 107-101.It was the apotheosis of the Iverson era and a Whitmanian triumph of the inidual, a moment that struck so far beyond sports into the essence of our city’s insurgent soul, validating everything Philadelphia embodies and fiercely protected in our Allen: uncompromising, defiant, self-certain to a fault with a taste for the fight. The better team won over the best-of-seven series, as happens in basketball, but Iverson’s Game 1 masterclass has come to transcend the outcome in NBA history and define his place in the basketball pantheon: the greatest pound for pound to ever do it and a hell of a player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a95f8f257cd8df49656254a4f7cfa3f93cdeeec9/0_216_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46bf63484d88caff11dec7ecb0a13fd1","title":"talking horses packed provisional schedule planned plus hong kong tips","story":"The BHA has arranged a series of Classic trials and Pattern races later this month should racing be allowed to returnA series of rearranged Classic trials and Pattern races have been scheduled for the last two weekends in May if racing is allowed to resume later this month, as the British Horseracing Authority seeks to rescue as much of the Flat season as possible once the current lockdown is eased. Thirty-five Listed and Group races due to be run in May have also been formally abandoned, however, taking the total number of Pattern races lost so far in 2020 to 54.The schedule, drawn up by members of the Flat Pattern Committee, would see the Greenham Stakes and Craven Stakes, two major trials for the 2,000 Guineas, taking place on different days over the weekend of 23-24 May. The Nell Gwyn Stakes and Fred Darling Stakes, trials for the 1,000 Guineas, would be staged the same weekend, along with five more Group Three events including the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and the Sagaro Stakes, a trial for the Ascot Gold Cup.The weekend of 30-31 May, meanwhile, would include the Lockinge Stakes, the first Group One of the season, along with the Group Two Yorkshire Cup, and the Dante Stakes, the most significant domestic trial for the Derby. The 2,000 Guineas and 1,000 Guineas would then be run on the weekend of 6-7 June, along with the Group One Coronation Cup, which would normally be part of that weekend’s Derby Festival at Epsom.If the BHA is able to proceed with this “best-case” scenario, Royal Ascot would remain in its traditional position in mid-June, starting on 16 June, with the Derby and Oaks being staged in early July.Those of us who are still learning about Hong Kong racing will be interested in the extent to which team tactics form a part of the action there, which should become clear in the running of Sunday morning’s Queen Mother Memorial Cup. Tony Cruz will saddle the likely favourite, Helene Leadingstar, whose four opponents are all from the John Moore stable.This is a Group Three contest but also a handicap and the interlinked form lines suggest it should be a pretty close affair at these weights. Moore has João Moreira and Zac Purton riding two of his horses, which ought to give any trainer hope.But Helene Leadingstar (6.30) is the “now” horse, having finally got his first two wins in Hong Kong after a couple of years’ trying. This step up to a mile and a half must help a horse who won the South Australia Derby in 2018, when known as Leicester.The races that make up the rest of the card are named after horses owned by the Queen Mother, including Special Cargo, Monaveen and Manicou. Hong Kong’s version of “the Game Spirit” turns out to be a six-furlong handicap on dirt and therefore unlikely to have suited the 1970s steeplechaser for whom it is named. Sunday morning’s card will be shown live on Sky Sports Racing.5.30 This “Griffin” race, featuring horses that had not competed before arriving in Hong Kong, has almost exactly the same cast as one that took place three weeks ago. Smiling Face was fancied that day but reared up in the stalls and was briefly parted from João Moreira, who was brave enough to climb back aboard. Runner-up to a useful-looking rival, the horse has hardly anything in hand over Chancheng Prince or Sea Monarch on that showing but that loss of composure may have cost him. If he behaves better on this second outing, he can justify the faith shown by punters that day.6.00 Demons Rock seems likely to be a short price for a horse that hasn’t won since he was a two-year-old entire with Tom Dascombe in the summer of 2017. A compelling case is hard to make for any of these but Fairy Floss could be worth chancing, since his only previous start on dirt was also the closest he has come to success. 7.00 It has taken time but Fabulous Eight now looks like making good on the promise he showed in late 2018. His third place last month was easily his best effort since then and he can be marked up a bit, having twice met trouble in running. From an in-form stable and with João Moreira aboard, he is sure to be a warm order.7.30 Others have more obvious claims but there was a lot to like about Mig Energy’s fifth place at Happy Valley just over a fortnight ago. He wasn’t beaten far that day after chasing too hot a pace, while the pair who forced it finished out the back. Hopefully a wide draw this time means he will avoid getting drawn into an early pace battle and, if so, he has the talent to get involved.8.00 He can lead if he needs to but the tactically versatile Excel Delight is perhaps best suited by creeping into contention, which was how he scored here in February. He nearly pulled off the same trick a fortnight ago when beaten by inches by a classy young rival and will be unlucky to find something of similar talent in this field. Striking Mr C made almost all when scoring here last time but will have to work harder from stall 12.8.35 This drop in class is interesting for Monster Kaka, who has dropped 20lb since starting in Hong Kong a year ago and now looks well treated and ready to win. He was a major eye-catcher when storming into third place a fortnight ago and the extra furlong should help. The lightly raced Snow Airjet may also be worth a second look.9.05 Rather like his days with James Fanshawe, Enzemble has taken time to put it all together in Hong Kong but he won with a degree of authority when last seen. This belated return to 10 furlongs must be a help to him and he can see off Defining Moment, who has been helped by the visor but now makes a step up in class.9.35 An unlucky loser three weeks ago on just his third start in Hong Kong, Party Genius is an obvious chance, but he’ll be a short price and is drawn wide again. Spicy Grill should be available at much bigger odds but is also going the right way and was beaten less than four lengths that day, after traffic problems. That was easily the best of his four runs and his first attempt at this trip. He should have more to offer.10.10 Some interest in Good For You seems likely after he won at Happy Valley in midweek but other results that day suggest the draw was a big factor and his two previous dirt runs have not been promising. Elite Patch appeals most, having won a couple of times in this grade in early winter before a step up in class made life tougher. 10.45 The cheekpieces have helped Everyone’s Joy, who gradually worked his way into form before running down a hot favourite here last month. Chad Schofield keeps the ride and they set the standard, with a handy inside draw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206dfd5e5c4ea726739548450ba8f0dc4984fe11/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=584bcfe35ba8dd713f41ec169391e649","title":"no end to lockdown uk holiday home owners businesses face ruin","story":"With no income and little idea when holidaymakers will return, many small accommodation businesses face ruin When Campwell opened for the first time on 14 February, the outlook was bright – despite the horrendous weather. The woodland eco-site near Bath may have been lashed by storm Dennis but it was full that first weekend and forward bookings were “fantastic”’ according to owner Tim Bowles: “It was really positive – we were already beyond our targets in terms of bookings and thinking we might even make a profit.”Just over a month later, the UK went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic and, like every other tourism business in the country, Bowles shut up shop. The outlook for his inaugural season went from bright to bleak. “It hasn’t been an ideal start,” Bowles said, although he admits he’s more fortunate than some. His landlord is a friend who is flexible about rent and two supervisors he employs have other work they can fall back on. But even without the pressure of meeting those costs, Bowles says it’s impossible for him to refund all his customers without putting the fledging business at risk. “Most customers have been very accommodating and agreed to reschedule. We have refunded some people, but if we refunded everyone we would be on our knees.”“There’s a lot of talk on social media about how evil businesses are for not giving a refund, but it’s important to remember that these are small business that are dependent on these bookings – we are a very seasonal business and half our season has already been erased,” added Bowles.He says he “appreciates other people are going through financial difficulty too,” but the timing of the crisis, coming at the beginning of the season, has been “brutal.” Unlike Airbnb, which announced full refunds or credits for guests who booked before 14 March (for stays up to 31 May) – a decision that hit inidual owners hard – few small independent businesses have cash reserves to fall back on. In the first few months of the year, owners often use deposits to refurbish accommodation ready for the new season, so most have little money in the bank, and some are in debt. Easter bookings are relied on to inject some cash into the business.Mary and Nate Sparrow, owners of Hippersons Boatyard, a collection of four houseboats and a glamping pod in Suffolk, invested in a second pod this year to increase capacity for the 2020 season, leaving them with no financial cushion. “People think we have loads of money behind us but we don’t. We are now trying to plan ahead financially and considering cashing in our pensions.”This year, Alistair Handyside, owner of Higher Wiscombe in south-east Devon, a collection of three cottages, invested £200,000 in the largest one. “One week later, we went into lockdown and the business stopped dead,” he said. “In 15 years of running a business, we’ve had three cancellations. On 23 March, we had 16, so this is on a scale that is unprecedented.”Handyside has already lost £80,000 in deferred business if he is unable to accommodate guests in July and August that will rise to £140,000. “Good businesses do not want to see customers missing out. If customers are being offered a full-value credit at a reasonable time – in other words, a fair swap, that is helping that business survive on really thin wages,” said Handyside, who is also chair of the Professional Association of Self-Caterers (Pasc).For Handyside, the biggest frustration has been the failure of insurers to pay out. “Most owners have business interruption insurance, but insurers are refusing coverage,” he said. “It’s probably going to be one of the big scandals of Covid-19.” The problem is being compounded by the failure of guests’ holiday insurance. Many holidaymakers are being told it’s up to their accommodation provider to compensate them, so holiday-home owners are becoming the “insurer of last resort”.The “insurance scandal”, as Handyside puts it, has left small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Many rely on repeat business from customers for the majority of bookings and do not want to jeopardise that loyalty but simply do not have the funds to refund everyone.Handyside said he is fortunate that his business is year-round, so there is a possibility of some recovery later in 2020, but seasonal businesses have already seen half their year wiped out.“It’s an absolute nightmare,” said Jacqueline Saggers who, with her husband, runs Guilden Gate, a smallholding in Hertfordshire with two glampsites. They have refused all refunds: “Not because we are being difficult but because we are a small family business and would go under if we did, and that doesn’t help anyone.”With only two sites, a VW van and a Hobbit-style shelter, she hasn’t even been able to give all guests the alternative dates they want because that would mean even more loss of income: “If we took everyone who’s cancelled and put them in July and August, we would have no income. We’re asking them to swap to September and October.” Adding “most guests are being very accommodating”.The Saggers have received a £10,000 government grant but “have to make it last” until they can start operating again. As to when that might be, there is no clear indication from the government yet. On 28 April, minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, announced that tourist hotspots will be off-limits “for some time to come”. Two days later, prime minister Boris Johnson told the daily briefing that it was important to “get tourism going again”, but not to the extent that “an influx of people would create a second wave of the disease”. Johnson said a “roadmap” for unlocking various parts of the economy will be revealed next week but “dates and times for each inidual measure will be driven by where we are in the epidemic and what the data is saying”.Duncan Jordan, owner of Cambrian Escapes near Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, which had been running for just under a year when the crisis struck, said: “We’re working on the basis that the summer’s gone. We’re hoping it isn’t, but when you hear the news, the work that needs to go in to helping people accept visitors and incomers into the community is huge.”Others are more hopeful that tourism businesses will be able to operate at some level from July onwards. “The worst case scenario is being shut down and not being able to operate until next year,” said Malcom Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, a region where one in five jobs are in tourism and one in three homes depend in some way on the tourism sector.“What we need is not to open a day too early or a day too late – we have to get this right,” said Bell. “There will be compromises: how do you make sure businesses are compliant? How do you give customer and community assurance? And how you minimise any risk to visitors?”Measures currently being considered to ensure Cornwall can safely welcome visitors include timed-ticketing at attractions to control numbers, vehicle restrictions in towns to keep numbers of visitors at a manageable level, and even a change in the law requiring holidaymakers to have documentation proving they are allowed to visit. “These might be seen as draconian, but let’s not rule them out at the moment,” said Bell. “The alternative is to keep everything shut – but we have businesses in despair, it’s causing mental health issues. We have to come up with a solution to help the economy while minimising the risks to visitors and the community.”In the meantime, owners facing the potential loss of their livelihoods are trying to stay positive. “At the moment the land is heavenly. The wildlife is incredible,” said Jacqueline Saggers at Guilden Gate. “But I can’t wait to be able to share it again with guests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus epidemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means that each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would each pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends both on the biology of the virus, but also our behaviour, such as social distancing. It also depends on the population’s immunity. At the start of an outbreak scientists often refer to the “basic reproductive number”, R0, which is a similar measure to R, but starts with the premise that the population has zero immunity through infection or vaccination.Under the current lockdown restrictions, R is now estimated to have dropped to somewhere between 0.6 and 0.9. This means that the epidemic is shrinking – although not uniformly. The figure given for London is 0.5 to 0.7, with some parts of the UK having a higher or lower figure.There is no obvious answer for what R needs to be in order for the lockdown to be lifted. That depends on how low ministers want the total number of cases to be if the government is to be able to effectively track and trace new cases. It is also not clear precisely how easing different restrictions will influence R – there is still uncertainty about how much schools contribute to transmission, for instance. So real-time tracking of transmission will be needed to continue providing a rolling estimate.Because once R inches above 1, even just a fraction, the number of cases will start sharply rising again, putting the UK on the path to a substantial second surge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65250bcc48b8e6ba30bd289b420de33caab7319b/180_0_3635_2182/master/3635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=275485a58064b30e2f5cd3431be965f9","title":"beyond lockdown covid coronavirus good news 19","story":"The Upside weekly newsletter on lessons of the pandemic and what might outlast Covid-19 Ten years ago I did three months of self-isolation.

If this period has taught us anything, it’s that life is short, too short to fritter away at someone else’s behest, but just about long enough if you can find out what makes you tick and stick to it.Many of you appear to agree. Last week we asked you: what will you take from lockdown into your new life? A selection of answers are below in the “what we heard” section. They are well worth reading.But before that, herewith the usual eclectic mix of viral and non-viral Upsiders from the past week:Away from the pandemic this week:More good news on the environmental front, with a record-breaking coal-less run in UK power generation.Good news for your pension, too: Covid may have obliterated stock markets in March but they bounced back in April.We salute efforts by our cousins at PositiveNews to crowdfund the distribution of their feel-good mag to healthcare workers across Britain. We love the notion of “suspended shopping” in Italy, a variation on the “pay it forward” idea, reported here by NPR.And CSM had a decent piece about the prospects of Covid-19 bringing about rapprochement in the Middle East.We had a full mailbag this week after we solicited ideas for what to take forward with us out of lockdown.What I want to retain from lockdown is this sense that every breath is precious, that every breath of our children is precious, ditto our friends and everyone who is vulnerable.Jonathan Bennett wrote a long screed from Virginia. The gist was in his final paragraph:Paul Kirkley mused on what travel might look like post-lockdown:Flying should be made VERY MUCH more expensive, so that it starts to reflect the true cost to the environment, and cuts the amount of flying to the bare essential, in order to achieve a severe reduction in carbon emissions.The budget airlines are quite correct in saying that keeping middle seats empty will have no realistic effect on social distancing: IT WON’T.And quite correct in saying that it will make their business model impossible: GOOD.And quite correct in saying that it would make flying much more expensive: IT SHOULD.Sarah Chalmers has been out and about in the wilds around Harrogate:I have learnt that the Nidd Gorge, which is half a mile from my house and where I run each day, is a beautiful, tranquil place teeming with birds and wildlife and, as I now have the time to see, ever changing day on day. I take a photo or video the sounds every day and will continue to do so throughout the year and after lockdown so I have a record to remind me of what is on my doorstep.Chris is using the period of illness to become healthier:I knew that my daily two-mile brisk walk was helping to keep my type 2 diabetes under reasonable control. With the lockdown, instead of the walk I resurrected my exercise bicycle in the kitchen. Doing a total of eight miles after meals has dramatically reduced the post-prandial glucose spikes, measured by my 14-day flash glucose monitor. If the predicted Hba1c score is confirmed by my six-monthly blood test, the doctor will probably want to reduce my medication. My blood pressure has also improved.And finally, do laugh along with the Reijans family and their domestic Olympics, which include toilet roll jenga, pot lid table tennis, and who can put on the most T-shirts in a minute.

Classes will be split in two and the groups will alternate between lessons at school and at home.Hygiene measures being adopted across Europe include strict handwashing and disinfection regimes, physical distancing and the demarcation of playgrounds into zones to ensure pupils do not mix more than necessary. Children will have to file out of classrooms at different times to maintain physical distancing.Germany has temporarily removed sport and music lessons from the curriculum because they are considered too great a risk, but older pupils already returned to sit exams last month. Nurseries will remain closed for all children, except those of key workers, for the time being.French lower secondary schools may only return in areas where the virus is not widely circulating. All ball games and contact sports will be banned and objects touched by more than one pupil must be disinfected. Classes will be staggered and made up of a maximum of 15 pupils, and breaks will held in shifts to avoid overcrowding in corridors and playgrounds.Many teachers say the draft health protocol detailing the regulations is unworkable, especially for classes of younger children.Céline Prier-Cheron, a trade union representative and teacher at a primary school in the Eure-et-Loir, told French TV: “How do you explain to children in nursery schools that they have to raise their hand to take an object, get up, go talk to a friend while respecting the barrier and distancing rules?“This health protocol cannot be applied as it is, especially in nursery schools. Teaching is based on the handling of objects, especially in nursery. If we have to disinfect objects each time a child has handled them, it’ll be impossible.”The parents’ federation, the FCPE, tweeted that parents were reluctant to send children back to school. “That is what our members are telling us, but they are obviously also under constraints from their employers,” it wrote. “But there are still too many uncertainties.”The president of Germany’s main teachers’ union, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, said he supported the plan to teach children in alternating shifts, but that regulating hygiene measures was a “mammoth task”. Despite the phased reopenings, scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution.Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germany’s leading coronavirus expert, who led the team.Drosten’s study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April.He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus.Data on children has been scant because of the lack of tests that have been carried out on them, often because they show few if any symptoms.“The end result is as clear as glass,” Drosten said on his podcast with the broadcaster NDR. “Children do not have significantly different concentrations of the virus in their respiratory passages compared to adults.”Drosten said children were as likely to spread the virus as adults, particularly given their social behaviour, including an inability to practice physical distancing, their increased mobility and a tendency to sing and cry – activities proven to give the virus droplets as much force as a cough or a sneeze. Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany’s leading disease control body, the Robert Koch Institute, said on Thursday that children play just as important a role in spreading the disease as adults. “They can be infected, they can excrete the virus and they can infect others,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eed6e8ef937a3f7fcbb82bf7e948fc447a4b01/276_829_2789_1673/master/2789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84a3ac56efa928bb5f392be08a7c7f3a","title":"chinas dining table revolution takes aim at shared chopsticks","story":"Authorities launch campaign to change communal eating habits after coronavirus On 18 January, about 40,000 families in the neighbourhood of Baibuting in Wuhan gathered for a massive potluck meal before the lunary new year. Photographs of the event, proudly published in local state media, showed residents in festive red and yellow bibs digging in, reaching with their chopsticks for hundreds of dishes laid out on banquet tables.Five days later, the city was placed under lockdown and within weeks, there were several possible coronavirus infections in the neighbourhood. For months to come that banquet would be cited as an example of how little local officials had done to prevent the virus from spreading across their city.In the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese authorities are pushing for a “dining table revolution” to change long-held traditions of communal eating like those on display at the Baibuting meal, where diners take from shared plates with their own chopsticks.Authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to convince diners to use designated serving utensils known as gongkuai or gongshao, or “public chopsticks” and “public spoon”. Officials are also encouraging the serving of separate portions rather than “family style”, where a group shares several dishes.It will be a difficult feat to pull off. After the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, a similar initiative petered out. More challenging is that sharing food is a key part of Chinese social life and a sign of intimacy.The gongkuai – more common in Japan, Korea or Taiwan – tend to be seen at higher-end restaurants in China and rarely used at home. Among family or friends, asking for the serving utensils can be awkward or perceived as rude.“The obstacle is the traditional notion that we have to drink together and eat together and not show any distance,” said Q Edward Wang, the author of Chopsticks: A Cultural and Culinary History. “That kind of notion is well-entrenched in Chinese society as well as around the world,” he said.Under chopstick etiquette, taught at an early age, one should touch only the food one intends to eat. But Chinese health officials say the practice leaves too much opportunity for germs to be passed through saliva from one’s own set of utensils to the shared dishes.Across the country, celebrities, business tycoons, public health experts, and teams of propaganda workers have been deployed to educate the public. “Divide meals, not love,” state media have declared.In Ningxia in north-west China, a video tutorial by local state media tells residents in local dialect of a “new trend in civilised dining”.“Dividing meals and chopsticks is not iding love,” it assures viewers. In Hangzhou, a local party member has called for 11 November to be designated “People’s Chopsticks Action Day,” given the date’s similarity to two sets of chopsticks.In Beijing, billboards call for citizens to join the campaign under the tagline: “Love is one more pair of chopsticks.” Starting in June, restaurants will be required to provide serving utensils and when possible to offer separate portions.At Huajia Yiyuan, a chain known for its Beijing roast duck, each place setting has two pairs of chopsticks and two spoons. At a popular hotpot restaurant on Beijing’s Ghost Street, all tables come with a set of the serving utensils. “Customers are very willing to use them,” said Lan Luoshi, 20, who works there. “If I go out with friends to eat or for hotpot, I will definitely use gongkuai,” she said.Changing habits at home and among the older generation may be harder. A common scene at family dinners involves relatives using their own chopsticks to put food on the plates of younger members of the family. Younger family members serve food to their older relatives as a sign of respect, while couples get food for each other in a show of affection.Many do not regard using the designated serving utensils as necessary at home. In a recent online poll by Sina Shanghai, half of more than 650 respondents said they would not use gongkuai or gongshao at home, agreeing with the response: “I won’t. We are all one family.”Chinese eating culture may be changing in other ways, away from crowded, bustling restaurants to quieter affairs. Many restaurants limit the size of dining parties to two and place tables at least 1 metre apart.Shi, 50, a chef at a noodle shop in a mall in Beijing’s Chaoyang district says he and his wife now rarely invite friends over. He recently noticed a group of co-workers come into his restaurant and naturally split into smaller groups, eating at separate tables.“The epidemic has already changed big things,” he said. During lunar new year in late January, authorities called on residents not to visit families, a key tradition for the holiday. “If the outbreak can change that, changing how we use chopsticks is nothing,” he said.According to Wang, it took hundreds of years for chopsticks to become the staple utensil. Changing modern eating habits, while difficult, should not take as long. “Customs are much more powerful than policy,” he said.“The pandemic and the government directives will provide some impetus. Gradually people will become more adjusted to the idea that even if we don’t share food, we are still friends.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc91d379a13d96c69c683187a8e143140f557e5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c28ea51ef21c1b1c0dcc456098e826cb","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance may1 2020","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un makes his first public appearance in nearly three weeks, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.His absence amid the pandemic led to speculation, though South Korean and US officials have stressed their belief he was not ill and could simply have been sheltering from the outbreak.At least 3,334,416 people have been infected and at least 237,943 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes.The president offers an increasingly bleak picture, telling a White House event: “Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless.”Trump, who initially dismissed the outbreak as a “hoax”, has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as low as 60,000 or 70,000.According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began.The drug remdesivir is approved for emergency use to treat virus patients. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarifies that the drug has specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital.Trump says the approval represents a “very promising situation” and the White House’s taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx adds: “I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.”Trump’s threats to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to the pandemic trigger a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount.Restrictions on movement are to continue for several more weeks in Ireland, although over-70s may now leave their homes to exercise. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says most restrictions will remain until 18 May to “weaken the virus further so it doesn’t make a comeback”.The UK reports 739 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 177,454 people have tested positive: an increase of 6,201 since Thursday’s update. Of those, 15,111 patients are in hospital, Hancock says.The country extends its lockdown – the world’s broadest by population – for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. The home ministry says that in view of “significant gains in the Covid-19 situation”, there will be “considerable relaxations” in areas with few or no cases.Some industries are allowed to reopen after five weeks of restrictions in Africa’s most industrialised nation, which was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March.Its easing comes after the ratings agency S\u0026ampP downgraded the country’s credit rating to junk on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da11c9235e4991f43251b49679e78bcb52f5ee4/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=417f285550c1d9966f9f22cd498bf0c9","title":"mps press for sanctions against israel over west bank annexations","story":"PM urged to impose sanctions if Netanyahu carries out threat to annex parts of West BankNearly 130 parliamentarians, including former Conservative cabinet ministers, have written to Boris Johnson urging him to impose economic sanctions against Israel if Benjamin Netanyahu’s new coalition government goes ahead with its threat to annex parts of the West Bank.The letter, signed by the former Tory chairman Lord Patten and the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, says annexation would be clearly illegal under international law.The signatories, which also include diplomats and prominent campaigners against antisemitism in the Labour party such as Margaret Hodge, point out that the UK did not hesitate to sanction Russia after the annexation of Crimea, claiming any move in the West Bank would warrant a similar response.Netanyahu has negotiated a right to annex parts of the West Bank from 1 July in the coalition deal he signed with Benny Gantz’s Kahol Lavan party, but he is thought to be waiting for approval from the Trump administration before deciding his next move. Trump wants annexation to be seen to be integrated into the peace plan set out by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last year.Britain joined a diplomatic démarche by 10 EU diplomats in a Zoom call this week warning the Israeli foreign ministry against annexation, but the imposition of sanctions as opposed to condemnation would be unprecedented.In the letter, organised by the Council for Arab British Understanding (Caabu), the signatories express outrage at the new Israeli government’s declared plan to annex areas of territories it occupied in June 1967, describing the move “as a mortal blow to the chances of peace between Israelis and Palestinians based on any viable two-state solution”.They claim it is clear the Israeli government is using “the cover of the Covid-19 pandemic to seek to implement this egregious plan. It is vital that the UK does everything in its power to prevent this.”They argue “international law is crystal clear. The acquisition of territory through war is prohibited. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 is a recent example where Britain quite properly opposed such acts with appropriate measures, including robust sanctions.“Our government has stated that any annexation ‘cannot go unchallenged. The government must now make clear publicly to Israel that any annexation will have severe consequences including sanctions. Words are not enough: Prime Minister Netanyahu has ignored our words. We need to prevent his government from setting this alarmingly dangerous precedent in international relations.”In a joint statement in September last year by the UK government, together with France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the UK warned any unilateral annexation of any part of the West Bank would be “a serious breach of international law”.David Jones, the chair of Caabu, said he regretfully thought Netanyahu would only listen to threats. Crispin Blunt, one of the signatories and the former chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said the issue was a massive test for the UK that he hoped his country would pass. He said he hoped Britain would take a stand by saying international law does stand for something, and bullying does not pay.Two Labour frontbenchers, Stephen Kinnock and Seema Malhotra, have signed the letter in a personal capacity, while the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has already written to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, asking him to oppose annexation.

Western Australia relaxed its own laws on Monday.For Matt and his wife Julia, in Sydney, this means they can go down the road to visit his sister, and introduce Harvey to his uncle and cousins. But they’re playing it safe, and won’t be taking him to see his grandparents for at least a few weeks more.“It is a very interesting time to bring a young person in the world,” Williams says. “The current situation in some hospitals is even the father can’t go in with the birthing mothers – so we were very lucky to have missed that.For Lisa Villani, Friday’s relaxation of restrictions means she can see her friend Deb Mansfield, who is recovering from surgery.Mansfield, 43, is a visual artist and former university lecturer, who now works in the disability sector. The pair met seven years ago and, until the shutdown, worked together at a pottery workshop.“In some of my toughest times, Deb has been the family in Sydney I didn’t have. She checks in. She delivers baked goods. She sends gifts,” Villani says.A few weeks ago, Mansfield visited (from 1.5 metres away, Villani adds) and told her they had found a growth on her ovary. She went in a week later for surgery.Before the hospital visit, they had kept in touch through a virtual passata-making class. Now they can’t wait to do the same in person.“I felt so helpless at a distance, not being able to see her or support her in the lead-up to and after her surgery,” Villani says.As soon as the new rules were announced, she invited Mansfield over for dinner.In Byron Bay, Damian Brady, 39, and wife Lisa Webb, 36, say that the restrictions on gatherings have been especially hard on their young kids – who have been missing their friends.“We pulled Harry, our oldest, out of daycare as soon as the virus started spreading in Australia,” Brady says. “It’s been a month and a half since he played with another kid. It’s difficult to explain to Harry why he can’t get close to people or play on playgrounds, and all his social activities like daycare, swimming lessons and circus arts stopped cold. Thankfully our youngest is only four months old so it hasn’t affected her much.”But as parents of three children, Brady and Webb are looking forward to the break as much as for themselves as the kids.“The last time we had a catch-up with any friends for any longer than a few minutes was sometime in February,” he says.“For my wife and I, it’s just been extremely isolating. We can talk to neighbours at a distance, but for most part it’s just the four of us in a house 247. We rarely went out before things changed, but it was always an option if we needed a break.”And the family reunions will still have to wait. The pair are originally from Queensland, and the state border is still closed to people who aren’t residents or essential workers.“Most of our friends and all the grandparents are in Brisbane,” Brady says. It shows how, though the lockdowns are partially relaxed, there is still much that people can’t or aren’t quite ready to do yet.Regardless, any outing feels like a blessing.“We won’t go all out – for us it’s about extending our isolation circle just a little to feel a bit more human,” Brady says. “Harry being able to play with another kid is something I’m really looking forward to. I know he is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa524691be3e206c89ace0698932b0c2e17b12c/0_0_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60f065762d3d74dc71b6a1b19f2d3d1","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

There is no immunity and no vaccine. It could flare up again.”The government needs to “get all its ducks in a row to come out of lockdown. This is a very transmissible disease”.Healthcare workers, even those wearing PPE are still being infected, he said. Shops offering baby wipes was not good enough.“I think somebody needs to take ownership of every step. There should be a task force like the Manhattan project – get everyone in a room.”Prof Lambert also said that everybody should be wearing masks “when out and about” and that contact tracing needs to be done within 24 hours. “I don’t understand why it is taking six days, they could be infecting many others in those six days.”Many thousands are not being tested because they have not displayed symptoms. There have been fewer cases in the community because of the lockdown. “We’ve plateaued but it is not going away.” If restrictions are lifted then cases could go up again, he warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243086.1588356643!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the reopening ireland plan in detail","story":"The current restrictions on social and economic life will be maintained for a further fortnight, and will be eased in stages from May 18th, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced this evening.“We need two more weeks,” Mr Varadkar said to effectively control the spread of the virus, warning that opening up the lockdown now could result in the country going “back to square one”.He announced two minor changes to the current restrictions - the 2km limit will be extended to 5km and over 70s will now be told that they can leave their homes but only if they avoid all contact with other people. Otherwise all restrictions will remain in place.Mr Varadkar said that on May 18th, should progress in containing the virus continue in the intervening two weeks, then the restrictions will be eased in a series of five stages, three weeks apart. “Our plan is to re-open the country in a slow, staged, phased way,” Mr Varadkar said.On May 18th, some retail outlets such as garden centres and DIY centres will be allowed open, some outdoor sports will be allowed and small groups of family and friends will be permitted to meet in the open. Construction and outdoor work will restart.In later phases, other businesses will be allowed reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.However, Mr Varadkar warned that the easing of the restrictions will depend on there being no “second wave” of the virus which could overwhelm health services.“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” he said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.“In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolate if they are sick.”Micheál Martin said he agreed with the cautious advice of the public health officials but called for clarity about the leaving certificate.Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “essential” to have a roadmap for the reopening of Ireland, and said that the testing capacity needed to be improved to allow for the lockdown to be lifted.In a televised address on Friday, Mr Varadkar said thousands of lives have been saved “because of the sacrifices and choice you have made”.“When we come through this, we will come together as a nation and grieve for everyone who has died over the course of this emergency,” he said.But he warned that the phases of reopening the country may have to be reversed back a step, if the rate of the infection increases significantly as the lockdown is eased.“We need two more weeks of tight restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said, so the virus does not have a chance to make a “comeback”.The curve has been flattened but “we have not yet won this fight”, he said.“I know for me the worst part has been the daily text message I receive at around 5 o’clock every evening of the number of deaths, and number of new cases,” the Taoiseach said. “I yearn for the day it stops.”The Full PlanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin re-opening from May 18th under a roadmap which contains five phases.The first phase begins on May 18thIn this early stage, up to four people not of the same household will be able to meet outdoors while maintaining strict social distancing. Funerals will still be a maximum of ten people. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working on allotments. But remote working will remain in place for the vast majority of businesses. Garden centres and hardware stores can reopen as well as opticians, bike repairs and phone repairs.Electrical outlets may open\u0026nbspTennis courts and golf courses can reopen but social distancing will apply. Outdoor public amenities and tourism sites may open. A maximum of four people can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities. Schools and college buildings will be opened to allow teachers to organise remote learning.The second phase begins on June 8thIn this phase, people will now be permitted to travel up to 20km but will be advised to avoid all unnecessary journeys. Over 70s will be allowed to shop at specific hours. Visits to homes of over 70s will be permitted by no more than a few people for a short period of time and they must wear gloves, face coverings, maintaining strict 2m social distancing.For everyone else, up to four people may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing. In terms of funerals, slightly larger numbers of people can be in attendance at funerals but they will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends.There will be a “phased return” of other workers who can maintain a distance from others of two metres at all times.\u0026nbspBusinesses that can maintain remote working will be asked to do so. Small retail outlets, with a small number of staff, and open marts could also\u0026nbspreopen.Libraries can open with limited numbers. People can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities where there is a small group team but this does not include matches.The third phase begins on June 29thTravel restrictions will remain at 20km. Cafes and restaurants that can adhere to social distancing guidelines will reopen. Creches will be reopened but only for the children of essential workers. Hospital and prison visits may resume but consideration will have to be given to the availability of PPE in each unit.Businesses will be asked to continue with remote working where possible but organisations where employees have a low level of daily interaction may return. There will be a phased reopening of non-essential retail outlets on the basis of restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. This will be limited to retail outlets with street-level entrance and exit i.e. which are not in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk.Playgrounds will be reopened where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. Some “behind closed doors” sporting activities will be permitted. Public transport will remain restricted. The Government will consider implementing travel restrictions on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres.The fourth phase begins on July 20thIn this phase, people can now travel outside their region. A slightly larger number of people (more than four, but the exact number has not yet been specified)\u0026nbspmay visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. The same will apply to other social gatherings outside of family and friends.Creches for all other workers will reopen but only for one a day a week to start with. Businesses will be asked to stagger work hours but Government will ask that remote working will continue. Hairdressers and barbers may reopen as well as museums, galleries, religious places of worship. Hotels and hostels will reopen on limited occupancy. Hotel bars will remain closed. Caravan and holiday parks may reopen. Restrictions on the numbers allowed to travel into urban centres will be decreased on public transport.The last phase begins on August 10thPubs, bars, nightclubs and casinos will reopen where social distancing and cleaning can be complied with. Festivals and other cultural gatherings may be held but with restricted numbers. Large weddings will still be restricted due to risk, as will other large gatherings. Normal visiting will resume in hospitals.A phased return to normal work will start around this time. Shopping centres will reopen as well as theatres and cinemas that can maintain social distancing. Close physical contact sports like rugby, boxing and wrestling will be permitted. Gyms can reopen where there is regular and effective cleaning.Sports spectatorship which involves mass gatherings will be permitted, but only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions. Indoor recreational venues like roller skating, bowling alleys and bingo halls may open where numbers can be limited. High-risk organisations which cannot maintain social distancing will be asked to implement plans for how they can eventually return to full complement. Some time after this period, schools will reopen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243129.1588362703!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"face coverings may be required in shops and on public transport says dr holohan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says road ahead tough but worth it in response to Covid-19.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollinsMore than 2,000 Garda members will be on duty on 12-hour shifts as part of Operation Fanacht this bank holiday weekend to ensure compliance with public health restrictions aimed at combating Covid-19.The operation began midweek and is set to continue up to midnight on Monday, with checkpoints being put in place on major roads nationwide.However, despite fears of complacency around compliance with the coronavirus restrictions, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said several times this week Garda members had found people understood the restrictions and were following them.Garda sources told The  that in the 48-hour period up to Friday night there had been no noticeable shift towards non-compliance and they had also seen no concerning increase in traffic volume.Senior officers said while there had been concerns people would drive to holiday homes over the recent Easter weekend, and that could be repeated again for this weekend, no significant evidence of that had emerged in recent days.ComplaintsMeanwhile, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) has branded as “unfair” the actions of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) in taking complaints from members of the public about Garda members not wearing gloves and masks, and then publicising those complaints by releasing statistics about them.Gsoc, which investigates complaints made about Garda members, said more than 70 complaints had been made since the Covid-19 policing operation began which related specifically to that operation. These included allegations Garda members had not been wearing face masks and gloves, as well as claims gardaí were rude or abrupt at checkpoints.However, AGSI general secretary Antoinette Cunningham said her association had always argued gardaí should be wearing facemasks and gloves because policing “runs contrary to social distancing”.Despite the calls by the association for personal protective equipment (PPE), she said, senior Garda management had decided members of the force should not wear the masks or gloves and so none had been made available.Rather than accepting such complaints from members of the public, Ms Cunningham said Gsoc should explain to those complainants that gardaí are not permitted to wear the items. She said accepting the complaints and then issuing a statement about them was very unfair to frontline Garda members and not helpful to the public.AdmissibleMs Cunningham said the other complaints, about rudeness and abruptness by some Garda members, should be investigated by Gsoc if they are deemed worthy of investigation and are admissible.“It would have been better if the validity of the complaints had been established first and then the statistics released afterwards.”Gsoc said it had notified Garda Headquarters of more than 70 complaints in a bid to assist Garda management in “identifying issues which may be emerging in the enforcement of the restrictions”.“The Ombudsman Commission believes that sharing anonymised details in this way in real time will alert the Garda Síochána to concerns emerging from the public and allow Garda management address issues as they arise,” Gsoc said.It added the names of the complainants or the gardaí about whom complaints were made had not been shared with the Garda and the admissibility of the complaints had yet to be established.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242745.1588329719!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what we know so far about lifting the lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople are seen jogging past a social distancing sign in the Phoenix Park in Dublin last week. Photograph: Jason CairnduffReuters Current restrictions introduced to deal with Covid-19 are expected to largely remain in place for a number of weeks, past their initial May 5th expiry date.Cabinet met at 3pm today to sign off on the exit plan from the lockdown with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar calling it a “road map to reopen Ireland”.Mr Varadkar identified five criteria for future decision making on the easing of restrictions including: the progress of Covid-19 healthcare capacity and resilience testing and contact tracing capacity the ability to shield at risk groups and the risk of secondary morbidity.A further 34 people diagnosed with Covid-19 have died, the National Public Health Emergency Team disclosed on Friday. There have now been a total of 1,265 deaths associated with the disease in Ireland, it said. Another 221 new confirmed cases were also reported, one of the lowest daily figures for some weeks. This brings the total number of cases to 20,833The phasesThe  understands the early stages of plans being discussed by the NPHET would see retailers, cafes and restaurants reopen on a limited basis, with the tourist industry also reopening on a limited basis in the mid-stages. Schools and colleges are not expected to reopen until September.NPHET is the body of medical experts and health service chiefs which has been overseeing the response to Covid-19 and advising the Government on steps it should take to navigate through the current coronavirus pandemic.The stages are broken down as: initial phase, early phase stage one, early phase stage two, middle phases and late phases. The latter two phases could be broken down into more stages.Initial drafts of the NPHET plan spaced the phases out in periods between early May and September, although no dates are on the latest draft being considered by NPHET.Under the latest draft the first phase would:- Allow the over-70s who are cocooning out to walk on a “no touch” basis and see them potentially allowed go to the shops at certain times. Sources previously suggesting others may be asked to stay at home while “cocooners” are out.-Allow outdoor workers such as builders and gardeners return to work.- Allow a maximum of four people not from the same household gather outside while obeying social distancing.-Recommence some restricted classes for Leaving Cert students.- Potentially increase the distance people can travel outside their home for exercise from 2km to 5km or 10km.-Businesses and manufacturing are expected to open in the early stages of the plan if they adhere to social distancing and health rules.- Allow retailers such as DIY and garden centres reopen.- Allow retail outlets deemed essential in an earlier round of restrictions – such as banks, repair shops, optometrists and others – open again.The broadening of family units is not seen as likely in the first phase. Other measures – such as the number of people allowed gather together – are also expected to be scaled up throughout the phases.Early phase stage one: would allow small retailers reopen by allowing only a limited number of staff and customers on the premises. - Restrictions on travel away from the home could increase to 20km.-Open marts could recommence.-Outdoor walks and parks where people are not stationary, are moving and can respect social distancing would reopen.Early stage phase two: would see cafes and restaurants reopen, as long as social distancing and strict cleaning rules apply.\u0026nbspPlaygrounds would open.The so-called “middle phases” would see the tourism industry – hotels, hostels, caravan parks – reopen on a limited occupancy basis.- Travel restrictions would be further eased to allow people travel outside their regions. Any holidays or breaks should be taken by family units only.-Creches would open for the children of essential workers.-Hairdressers would open. It is understood that this would be possible only where protective equipment is available.The “later phases” would see the wider reopening of the economy – such as pubs and offices – again if social distancing is implemented.- Creches for children of non-essential workers would open on a staged basis – such as one day a week from the start.-Mass gatherings of over 5,000 people have already been effectively cancelled until September.Guidance around these events is unlikely to be provided until much later in the year, similar to family events such as weddings.-Cocooning is also expected to last for the foreseeable future, until vaccines or treatments for Covid-19 are found.Builders hope to restart the construction industry by picking up work in almost complete sites, before moving to outdoor work on sites such as housing estates and then moving to new estates. Minister for Business Heather Humphreys told the Dáil all businesses must adhere to the guidelines when they re-open. She said they would be backed up “through inspections and enforcement using the full suite of resources available across the State”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243161.1588368725!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord roadmap but no magic key for reopening ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThis time Leo addressed the nation from the bottom of the stairs.  And he skipped the poetry. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandThere was something missing in the polished cameo shot with the camera trained on Leo alone. And it wasn’t the poetry.It was the slogan.Even though it wasn’t there, we could see it in the mind’s eye as a Taoiseach in possession of no government showcased his statesmanship in front of an audience of the people. There, in neat general election letters, above his head.This was what Friday evening’s big speech was all about. Complete with a roadmap and the unided attention of a worried nation anxious for guidance and reassurance.Varadkar delivered this in the process of confirming his Government’s comprehensively leaked decision that the Covid-19 restrictions are to continue for two more weeks, with just a few minor changes. However, there is a plan to gradually unwind the shutdown in a series of stages, in a sensible way.Hard to argue with that.“Reopening Ireland”. From the people who brought you “Project Ireland”.They know their way around a plan they have managed the lockdown very competently and now seem best poised to unwind it. Leo Varadkar sold it very well during his latest address to the nation.If he can deliver on the roadmap, and the shaky-looking government formation talks hit the buffers, it could be just the ticket to a new term.This speech marked a radical departure by the Taoiseach.Yes, he was still front and centre in the grandeur of Government Buildings, with the showy accoutrements of State positioned around him. Still standing tall in the middle of the picture looking all handsome and leaderly.But here’s the daring twist: this time Leo addressed the nation from the bottom of the stairs. Last time, he impressed us hugely from the Serious Corridor upstairs.High-fives all round for smarts.Of course, the absence of poetry was noted. Did ideas man John Concannon accidentally drop The Heaney Book down the back of a radiator? Or maybe the speechwriter was still sulking because Labour’s Alan Kelly quoted Eavan Boland, who died this week, in the Dáil on Thursday, thus stealing a march.Whatever. This was of no real interest to working journalists, who hung around Leinster House all day wondering when they would be informed of a time and place for the unveiling by the Taoiseach of his much-trailed Covid Lockdown Exit. They really wanted to ask him questions about it.But they couldn’t because Leo’s people decided it was time for another Soliloquy on Merrion Street. At least the hacks were able to recite most of the lines along with him because they were comprehensively leaked well before he opened his mouth.Although, to be fair, the Taoiseach would be going on The Late Late Show a few hours later, there to be eviscerated by Ryan Tubridy along with the other light entertainment acts offering themselves up for Friday night slaughter. And you can’t say braver than that.The unwinding will take part in five stages at three-week intervals. Here, the Taoiseach signalled the numbers by quickly unfurling his fingers, just like the host of an old, incomprehensible game show called 3-2-1, in which the co-star was “Dusty Bin”.The biggest news from Government Buildings was that “the over-70s will be allowed out”. What happens after that is anybody’s guess. They might wreck the gaff. Just as well the pubs will remain closed. Along with DIY shops and garden centres, which will have to wait a few weeks longer while the big supermarkets buy in new stock and take all their business.We hear the Taoiseach and members of his cabinet were overjoyed when told the exit strategy would involve “five stages” and there was terrible disappointment when the news was broken that these were not actual stages, for performance purposes.It’ll be more like Tour de France stages: gruelling, but ultimately exhilarating.People will be able to exert themselves now over five kilometres, instead of confining themselves to two. This means they will be able to lie less to gardaí, which will remove a lot of stress.Two more weeks of tight restrictions should be doable, when the outcome means the safety of family members and fellow citizens.“Not long from now, some summer night, we will see our friends again,” mused Leo, waxing slightly poetic. Wistfully.He mentioned the “10,000” or so letters he has received in recent weeks. Who knew so many people feel compelled to write to the Taoiseach with their thoughts and dreams and problems and desires?Tight restrictions? We know all about them after weeks of flattening the curve. Another two shouldn’t make much difference at this stage when the future looks elastic.Never mind. The Fianna Fáil leader, stuck in the Leinster House carpark, mentioned them. Leo stole his thunder in every other department – it’s difficult for Micheál to stay relevant. Micheál’s backdrop was of the railings in front of the National Library and a fella wheeling his bicycle past the camera. Not a patch on the flags and pillars and marble staircase of Government Buildings.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald was also canvassed for her opinion on TV after the Taoiseach’s performance. Her backdrop was even gloomier, in a darkened room in front of a black-and-white portrait of Countess Markievicz.Meanwhile, the man in possession of no government but still firmly in charge told the nation that their effort so far “has been worthwhile. It is working. So let’s finish what we started.”The good days will come again, promised Leo.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242928.1588346815!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the animals are baffled at dublin zoo what happened the humans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPink flamingos stand silently  in their enclosure at a closed Dublin Zoo. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Dublin Zoo today is equal parts magic and tragic. The excited shrieks of families marvelling at big cats and gasping at the acrobatics of sea lions have been silenced and the gaggles of school tours laughing as they play under the big tree near Haughton House are gone.Yet in the absence of humans there is wonder in the wild sounds made by the animals – big and small – who have the place to themselves.Small ducks waddle along paths untroubled by human feet, flirting with each other as they trip lightly along their way. They are watched by a pride of biblical lions lounging at the front of their enclosure, while the macaques nearby throw fresh straw at each other as tigers prowl, alert to every move made by the handful of people who pass them each day.The elephant family does its own thing, as it always has done.More than six weeks ago the zoo – which is among the top tourist attractions in Ireland with over 1.2 million visitors annually – closed its doors to all but a core team of socially distanced zookeepers working in strictly controlled groups to combat infection.They are watched over by zoo director Leo Oosterweghel. He has been at the helm of Dublin Zoo for almost 20 years, and never once imagined he would see days like this. His home is the zoo, and he is the person best placed to record how the absence of people has impacted on the animals he cares for.“They look at me with more surprise now,” he says. “They come up and have a good look because they’re wondering what’s happened to everyone else. They are used to visitors.”Before the zoo closed it employed over 100 people – only 40 remain.“Most of our people have been laid off,” the director says. “All we have now is the animal care team and some support staff. We had to let so many people go and that has been extremely difficult. It is hard to tell someone they are non-essential because we are such a close-knit team here.”EntertainmentDublin Zoo was first conceived in the Rotunda Hospital in 1830 by a group of medics with a view to providing entertainment for well-heeled Dubliners and easy access to animal corpses for doctors. Once animals – specially the primates – had outlived their usefulness as spectacles their cadavers were prized for research purposes.It could scarcely be more different now. Today the animals always come first. The zoo’s main focus is their welfare and conservation, and much of the money it raises each year funds projects across the world aimed at protecting endangered species in the wild and developing critical breeding programmes in captivity.“We have had to slow down our conservation efforts because every euro counts. And that breaks your heart,” says Oosterweghel.But there are steps he will never take no matter how difficult things get.“I have heard of some zoos talking of animal euthanasia to reduce their costs, but that is never going to happen here, not on my watch. It is not even discussed.“We have all of the costs and none of the revenue,” he says.The food bill alone is close to €10,000 a week, added to which is the cost of wages for the essential staff. As a self-funding charity, the zoo gets no aid from the State but Oosterweghel says the zoo may need a “bridging loan” in the weeks ahead.60 acresWhile times are bleak, the zoo perhaps has an advantage over many attractions as it is outdoors and spread over 60 acres of the Phoenix Park. Yet even so social distancing in the future will have to be carefully managed. “We don’t know when we will reopen or what we might look like when we do,” he admits.He has given up speculating as to when that day might come. “It all depends on what the Government tells us to do, and when we can do it.”Just as it is beyond the zoo’s high fences, health is of utmost concern.“The virus is very much on our radar, and we have sharpened our protocols. From the start the zookeepers looking after primates wore mask because we knew there could be cross-transmission . They now wear masks when looking after the cats too.”That happened after it emerged in early April that a tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo had tested positive for Covid-19 after contracting it from a caretaker who was asymptomatic at the time.As Oosterweghel talks and walks, the pink flamingos stand silently on little islands in their enclosure. Then one sees humans and starts squawking. Soon it is joined by dozens of excited others. Once the humans turn a corner, the flamingos fall silent again.Around that turned corner the sea lions are putting on a show for zookeeper Daniel Dunne. His job in recent weeks has been to “ensure that they are stimulated and exercised and fed and taken care of”. He also makes sure their habitat is in pristine condition.Like all the zookeepers he has been working in a small team with no interaction with others. He admits that it has become a little lonely.Nearby the tigers are having lunch at the front of their enclosure, seemingly unconcerned or even aware of the presence of people. But when we turn to walk away one of them is upon us in an instant, only inches away and separated by some thankfully thick glass. “You turned your back and their instinct is to go after you as prey,” Oosterweghel says.They don’t go after him, though. They high-five him instead. He casually places the palm of one hand on the glass and one of the great cats immediately responds by rising up on hind legs and putting a giant front paw in the director’s hand – or as close to it as the glass allows. The bond is impossible to miss.Super-smartMel Sheridan is minding the elephants as they mind their own business“I don’t doubt for a second that they have noticed that the humans are not around because they are super-smart and nothing gets passed them,” she says. “But they are just so focused on their own family unit, and they just want to eat and play and roll in the mud, so they’re okay.”As we walk away she shouts after us “it’s nice for us to see other people though”. She sounds lonely too.Oosterweghel walks past the zoo’s farm. A cow approaches him for a nuzzle, a sheep looks on with jealousy in her eyes.“It is so quiet now,” he says sadly. “You can really take your time walking around looking at the animals. But unfortunately we cannot share it.”Not now, perhaps, but soon. Hopefully.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242166.1588270051!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus north netherlands stopped following national advice here s what happened","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn intensive care patient is moved from an air ambulance at the University Medical Center in Groningen, the Netherlands. Photograph: Robin UtrechtEchoes WireBarcroft Media via GettyAccording to the official Dutch count, there have been 4,795 coronavirus deaths in the Netherlands. This is an underestimate: it only includes people who tested positive, and mortality data suggests actual deaths are 40 per cent higher. It also disguises deep regional differences.In the worst-hit region of North Brabant in the south, twice as many people died between March 16th and April 5th, 2020, than in the same period last year. But in the northern region of Groningen, home to a university city the size of Cork, deaths were just 4 per cent higher in the same period.What can explain this stark difference in a country half the size of Ireland that is one of the most densely populated in the world?The man held partly responsible is Prof\u0026nbspAlex Friedrich, a virologist and head of microbiology and infection control at\u0026nbspthe University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the major hub of medical care in the northern Netherlands.Friedrich announced on March 19th that the north was departing from national Dutch policy. While the public health agency would be restricting testing to only severe and priority cases, he announced the north would follow\u0026nbspthe World Health Organisation’s advice: “test test test”.\u0026nbsp“In the Netherlands, in our country, they said that diagnostics is interesting for statistics but not important for the fight against the disease. There I strongly disagree,” Friedrich told The .The UMCG set up a test centre on its grounds, hired medical students for extra staff, and asked the local health authorities to direct people there for screening.\u0026nbsp“We just did it,” Friedrich recalled. “You save lives by doing diagnostics. Proper diagnostics, case tracing, information, is one of the strongest weapons we have to fight the virus.”International insightCrucial to the decision-making was an international perspective. Friedrich did not rely on the limited academic studies available on the new virus, but directly telephoned doctors in Italy to ask what they were seeing in their patients.He learned they were spending twice as long in intensive care than Dutch national modelling accounted for, and he adapted the hospital’s plans accordingly. Friedrich maintains that learning from the experience of other countries is crucial to fighting the pandemic.This insight was important, but so was luck.School holidays in the Netherlands are staggered. The north had theirs a week earlier than the rest of the country. It meant that Dutch people from the south and west were much more likely to bring coronavirus home from skiing holidays in Austria and Italy, as they travelled when outbreaks there were more widespread. This was compounded by the mass public events of carnival season, which are held in the south but not the north.This meant when the Dutch government finally began banning public events on March 10th, it was too late for Brabant, but not for Groningen, according to Friedrich.“We talked to the public health service and said we are going to do something different from the national way,” he recalled.A few initial detected cases in Groningen were health workers who had travelled abroad. But soon\u0026nbsptests were discovering Covid-19 in health workers who had travelled only to other regions of the Netherlands.“We realised there was no difference anymore between the south and the west of the Netherlands and northern Italy. So we told our staff: you are not allowed to go outside our region, and if you do so you cannot come to work. You have to stay at home for two weeks,” Friedrich said.With 15,000 staff and as the central healthcare node for the whole region, the UMCG was big enough to set policy for the wider north. According to Friedrich, the decisive intervention was screening healthworkers, whether or not they had symptoms. A fifth of those who tested positive never developed any.“In healthcare institutions, 10, 20 or 30 people can be infected by just one person,” Friedrich said. “In other parts of the country where the numbers are still high, I suspect it is outbreaks in healthcare institutions and long-term care that are the major drivers of the epidemic.”‘Group immunity’Though Friedrich has been part of the outbreak management team that co-ordinates the Dutch response to the crisis, he is critical of aspects of national strategy.On March 16th prime minister Mark Rutte announced that the Netherlands would build “group immunity” by allowing the virus to roam the population in a controlled manner. The government subsequently walked back from this, but the policy still has its adherents.Friedrich is not one of them.“Herd immunity can never be a public health strategy. It can never be controlled, and it means people will die, and if you are not very careful a lot of people will die,” Friedrich said.“It’s not a law that we’re all going to get infected. It’s just the consequences of our insufficient action to protect people.”He has doubts about whether survivors of the disease even reliably built immunity. “Immunity does not happen automatically,” Friedrich said. “It might be very local, in the nose or throat. But then you could swallow the virus, and get an infection in your gut.”Delaying the spread gives doctors and scientists time to understand the disease and develop more effective treatments, which Friedrich believes will emerge more quickly than a vaccine.“For a vaccination you need to produce it for all the billions of people on the planet, which takes time, and you have to administer it,” he explained.“It’s not like a therapy that you give to a sick person: there, you might take into account there are side effects, but consider them acceptable because you have to save a life. If you are giving a vaccination to healthy people all over the world, you need to be very, very sure that this is safe.”His focus now is preparing for the winter, the worst season for respiratory infections. Friedrich expects it to bring a wave of infection that was worse than the first.“We need personal protective equipment, we need more intensive care beds, we need more healthcare staff, we need more diagnostics in all hospitals in the country,” Friedrich said.“You cannot expect things will go back to normal, thinking that normal is the world as it was before February. That is not really realistic. We have to change so that we can handle this.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242208.1588271612!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu tells uk it must set out plans for northern ireland customs checks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: the commission told member states that the Northern Ireland protocol was the biggest challenge in implementing the withdrawal agreement. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPool via ReutersEuropean Union officials have told Britain it must set out its plans for customs and other checks under the Northern Ireland protocol, as Northern business representatives urged Westminster to offer more clarity. Both the EU and Britain described the first meeting of a specialised committee on the protocol as constructive but the European Commission warned that time was running out.“As time is short, the commission underlines the importance of the UK setting out its plans with regard to all implementation measures prescribed by the protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland and providing a detailed timetable. The exchanges in the specialised committee now urgently need to be followed up by tangible measures,” it said.Earlier, the commission told member states that the Northern Ireland protocol was the biggest challenge in implementing the withdrawal agreement governing Britain’s exit from the EU. In a technical note seen by The , the commission said the most politically sensitive issue required the most extensive adaptations by businesses and needed the most timely preparation.“To avoid disruptions of business activity, the United Kingdom should urgently engage with the business community in Northern Ireland, as businesses must be able to prepare for the new requirements well in advance. The commission services are available to provide any assistance that may be required,” the note says.“The commission expects the United Kingdom to provide the requested details, and detailed timelines, on the implementation measures it intends to take as a matter of urgency. The commission also expects the United Kingdom to enter into technical implementation discussions with the relevant commission services immediately.”Thursday’s meeting, which was conducted virtually, was co-chaired by officials from Britain and the European Commission and attended by Irish and Northern Irish officials and representatives from a number of other member states.“The UK was clear that our approach at all times will be focused on protecting the BelfastGood Friday Agreement and gains of the peace process, and on preserving Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. UK officials reaffirmed our commitment to complying with our legal obligations under the protocol, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs,” the British government said in a statement.MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs committee on Thursday heard calls from business, farming and retail representatives in the North for more clarity about how Britain plans to implement the protocol.Aodhan Connolly of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium said the details needed to be pinned down and businesses needed to hear how the cost of extra paperwork would be mitigated.“If we don’t have those mitigations there is a simple equation. If the new costs because of this protocol are higher than the profit margin, either the product or the business model becomes unviable.

Photograph:  Pippa FowlesAFP via Getty ImagesBritain’s health secretary Matt Hancock has claimed to have met his goal of increasing coronavirus testing to 100,000 a day by the end of April despite questions over how the tests were counted. Mr Hancock said 122,347 tests were carried out in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday, more than twice the number being conducted daily at the start of the week.“A big increase in testing provides a way to unlock the puzzle of the coronavirus and testing forms the first element of our plan to test, track and trace.\u0026nbspBy mid-May, we will have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place. That work is under way as we speak and if it needs to be bigger we will scale it as required.\u0026nbspMr Hancock said he knew the goal of 100,000 tests a day was an audacious one when he set it last month, hailing co-operation between public health authorities and private enterprise in reaching it. But Labour’s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused the government of massaging the testing figure because almost a third of the total were testing kits sent out by post but not yet returned.“Labour has repeatedly called for more testing, and increasing testing is an important milestone. But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out. Tonight’s headline figure shouldn’t count tests that hadn’t been used, or indeed, might never be used as a completed test. Ministers promised transparency – the public and NHS staff deserve clarity,” he said.Nursing homesA total of 27,510\u0026nbsppeople have died in Britain after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 739 since Thursday and the highest death toll in any European country apart from Italy. Boris Johnson said this week that Britain had passed the peak of coronavirus infections and his government will next week outline the next stage in its strategy, although the lockdown is expected to remain.The number of people with coronavirus in hospital is falling but Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said on Friday that the peak of deaths in nursing homes is ahead.“We are a long way behind, because despite what the health secretary says, about us being always regarded as a priority, well clearly we weren’t. Clearly we weren’t at the centre of this pandemic. So I just think the government needs to understand that, if they knew in January we were the high-risk area,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/05/01/TELEMMGLPICT000230481054_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant let social distancing go years even cost many lives","story":"As a parent, I have to ask myself whether I can tolerate allowing my children’s youth to drain away like thisTwo of my children still live at home – teenage boys aged 16 and 14. The oldest is mad-keen on rugby. He plays on the wing, keen on taking the contact in the tackle, breaking through and using his lightning pace to finish the try. My 14 year old loves football. I take him along on Sunday mornings and watch him do his tricks and flicks to beat the defender, then sprint away to score.My wife was a former international squash player, and I play a bit myself three or four times a week, when I’m not playing football, singing in my a cappella choir or drinking with work colleagues at our wine bar.You’ll notice something about these activities: in none of them is any form of social distancing possible. You cannot socially distance in a scrum, when leaning in to hear close harmonies, or when chasing down a drop shot in squash. Many of the activities of everyday life rule out social distancing altogether.The Chief Medical Office Chris Whitty and Professor Neil Ferguson, author of the influential Imperial College modelling, both say that their plan is for us to maintain strong social distancing until there is a vaccine for the coronavirus, which Chris Whitty says will certainly be at least a year and possibly more.What does that mean? I suspect many people, listening to them say that, assume they can’t possibly mean that we’ll have to keep a two metre distance from anyone outside our immediate social group for years. When they say “social distancing” they can’t actually mean social distancing as is currently understood? That must mean we wear masks to the shops or something – right?Alas, until they tell us otherwise, I think we must assume that when they say “social distancing” they mean it. We must assume that this rules out school orchestra concerts, team sports, New Year’s Eve parties, big weddings, football crowd, small theatres, squash, singing groups, nightclubs or anything else where we would be close together with people outside our immediate social group. And I think that when they say that might go on for years, we must assume they mean it might go on for years.As a parent, I have to ask myself whether I can tolerate allowing my children’s youth to drain away like this. My 16 year old wants a career in sport – if not as a player then as a coach or a media or a statistical strategist. But none of that can happen in a world of years of social distancing. His chance at being his school team star will pass. His dream of a career will lapse. The years fly by and his youth is gone, and all he ever did with it was avoid coming within two metres of a stranger.If that is the plan, I shall have to try to find some other country to send or take my children to. Anyone with options will do so.It’s easy to say: “But it won’t come to that.” We can all see that the idea of maintaining social distancing for years is madness, the kind of thing only nerdy scientists could propose. When we see such a crazy thing proposed by policymakers, it’s tempting to assume it just can’t happen. But we can all think of things in our world of wokeness that seemed too crazy to be plausible that then went on to happen. Why not this?I believe that politicians will intervene, a policy of sustained social distancing for years will collapse and they’ll claim they never intended it in the first place. But that will only happen because enough of us are willing to stand up and tell the unpleasant truth: to maintain strong restrictions for years, robbing young people of their youth and degrading all of our lives immeasurably, is too high a price to pay for saving 100,000 people from an early death. That does not mean we should sacrifice nothing to try to save them. But years of social distancing, depriving millions of people of their mundane everyday pleasures, is too much to be acceptable.All politicians hear is the relentless screams of those crying “Tens of thousands dead! Why did you not do more?” People say “The government would never be forgiven if they let 100,000 people die.” Well, then we must make them believe they would be even less forgiven if they let years of everyone else’s life pass by while strong social distancing is maintained.People say to me: “So you are saying 100,000 people should die so that one day your son can play rugby, you can sing in a choir, and some other folk can have a New Year’s Eve party?” Yes. That’s exactly what I’m saying. And the truth is that many reading this will know, deep down, that I’m right.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Not unreasonable, you might think. The virus was made in China. It has now put paid to the prosperity of almost everyone. We would like to know why it happened.Then, on Thursday, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, an Australian businessman, gave a press conference in Melbourne with the Australian health minister. He announced his procurement of £5 million-worth of Covid-19 testing kits from China. Twiggy is a billionaire because his business, part-owned by, and overwhelmingly dependent on, China, supplies it with iron ore. Without warning the health minister, Twiggy invited the Chinese consul-general to speak at the same press conference.The consul-general praised China’s “open, transparent and responsible manner” over Covid-19, adding sweetly: “This project is another testimony of the friendship and the co-operation between our two countries and the two peoples ... the virus knows no ideology, border or race … we’re all in this together.” The minister had been set up by his fellow-countryman and by China.This sequence epitomises the Chinese Communist Party in its dealings with the West in the era of Xi Jinping. Here is the blatant, brutal threat. Here is the almost equally blatant trick which seems to offer the hand of friendship. And here, I regret to say, is the third key component – a Western prominente who, for reasons of self-interest, takes China’s part.In the old days, Communist regimes devoted great energy to winning converts in the West. The Soviet Union succeeded in recruiting some actual traitors and infiltrating trade unions. At the height of Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution in the Sixties, students were deluged with copies of his Little Red Book. Such propaganda had some effect: absolutism always attracts some people. But these efforts were what we nowadays call “clunky”. The Communists – especially the Chinese – were too cut off from us culturally. They were also very short of money.From the late Seventies, that began to change. By the 21st century, Chinese influence had become, one might say, pandemic. China opened up to the West and vice versa. People and businesses approved by the Chinese Communist Party started to come here in serious quantities – for tourism, study, investment, houses in Belgravia. There were many benefits for both sides. Many Western countries, however, suspended any sense of strategic vigilance. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, our government scrambled for contracts. Hence, of course, Huawei.Universities, desperate for the much larger fees that can be charged to foreign students, sold their services to China. In 2012, for example, Cambridge University set up the Chong Hua chair in Chinese Development with £3.7 million from Wen Ruchun, the daughter of the super-rich then Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. Peter Nolan, who had taught her at Cambridge, took up the professorship. He had written a book with her husband, Liu Chunhang, a Chinese banking regulator. In the same year, Professor Nolan published a book called Is China Buying the World?, a question to which his short answer was “No”. But some said it had succeeded in buying a professorship at Cambridge. The Daily  exposed these connections.Professor Nolan stepped down from the Chong Hua chair last year. It remains unfilled, perhaps because, if you want it, you must demonstrate a “research record of international stature in ‘global China’.” In recent months, the concept of “global China” has made millions of people feel sick.In a speech to Peking University last year, the current Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, Stephen Toope, praised Professor Nolan’s work. He declared that the China Development Forum’s theme of “Greater Opening Up for Win-Win Cooperation” “thrilled” him. China and Cambridge are on the same side, he said, wanting openness rather than “angry isolation”, and a “global society” against those who wish to “ide and conquer”. These isive conquerors were unnamed but Professor Toope’s openness to the Chinese Communist Party contrasts with his attitude to Brexit. Last year, his university prevented contributions in favour of Brexit on its website while allowing numerous anti-Brexit ones.In the professors’ speeches on China, I cannot find the phrase “academic freedom”, perhaps because China permits no such thing. Chinese universities are controlled by the Communist Party. Chinese influence and money threaten academic freedom here in Britain. Scared of Chinese displeasure, otherwise reputable universities try to prevent speakers on campus who criticise the Chinese government. Members of their academic bodies are sometimes controlled by the Chinese embassy in London. I am told by dons that Chinese students nowadays shut up in the presence of other Chinese students, because each fears the other will report them to the embassy.I spoke yesterday to Stephen Tsang, Professor of Chinese Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies. China’s obsession with control, he says, is an eternal problem. The question is how we face it: “The real issue is when British universities do not defend their own intellectual freedoms.” “Self-censorship” is rife. Some universities are held hostage by the campuses they have opened in China itself.This week a reader sent me a strange message put out by the Peking University HSBC Business School. Although it perches in Boars Hill, near Oxford, it announced that it was proudly donating “1,000 pieces of PPE clothing, 300 protective medical goggles, and batches of test kits to Cambridge University Hospitals”. The message lauds Professor Toope for all the deals he has done with Peking University. Then the dean of the business school praises his own gift: Cambridge “really needs help” and a “friend in need is a friend indeed”.A friend indeed? It seems an odd phrase for a system of governmental, scientific and intellectual control whose secretiveness and mendacity have created the most sudden and widespread health crisis in history. Our politicians, professors and businessmen need to realise that the West has been insulted. Trust has succumbed to the disease. It cannot be restored by the gift of a few thousand (malfunctioning) face-masks. An international inquiry is a necessary start, yet our Government shies away from calling for one.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it\u0027s really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you\u0027re taking care of them. It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said. There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we\u0027re not used to dealing with.Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works. Since it\u0027s a new virus, we don\u0027t have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don\u0027t have any starting place. I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it\u0027s really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you\u0027re taking care of them. It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works.

The comments appeared to lead the share price to drop immediately, falling 10 per cent in the wake of the posts.Elon Musk tweets \u0027FREE AMERICA NOW\u0027 in criticism of lockdownNow give people back their FREEDOM, the third post read. Mr Musk then posted the final lines of the US national anthem.In recent days, many of Mr Musk\u0027s posts have criticised the government lockdown and attempted to suggest that the public are misled over the scale of the coronavirus crisis.In a flurry of tweets earlier this week, he posted FREE AMERICA NOW and Give people their freedom back.He also used a Tesla earnings call to attack the lockdown as fascistic as part of a impassioned diatribe.Mr Musk has been known to use his Twitter account to post controversial and unusual messages in the past.He has said in the past that the strange nature of those messages has led to Twitter locking his account, fearing that they had been posted by a hacker.Created with Sketch.Armed protests against stay-at-home coronavirus measures in Michigan Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstrator shouts next to two masked security guards at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan during a protest against stay-at-home ordersArmed members of a milita group at the state Capitol building in Lansing, Michiga, during a protest against coronavirus lockdown measuresA protester at the state Capitol in Lansing holds a sign comparing Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer to Adolf Hitler during a demonstration against coronavirus lockdown measuresAn armed protester takes part in a demonstation against lockdown measures at the state Capitol in Lansing, MichiganA protester holds a sign saying \u0027Bill Gates is evil\u0027 at a demonstration against stay-at-home orders at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan.

But they have largely attempted to do that by impersonating him, including taking control of other verified accounts and making them look as if they were Mr Musk\u0027s official account.The new outburst came as Nasa announced that one of Mr Musk\u0027s other companies, SpaceX, was one of three firms in the running to make the lunar lander for humanity\u0027s return to the moon\u0027s surface. SpaceX already has a number of key contracts with the US government, including one that will see it send Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station in a matter of weeks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Altogether, the contracts for the initial 10-month period total 967 million US dollars.This is the last piece that we need in order to get to the moon by 2024, Mr Bridenstine said.Nasa shares images of \u0027doomed\u0027 Comet Atlas as it breaks into piecesHe noted it will be the first lunar lander since the last Apollo moon mission in 1972.Over the next 10 months, each company will refine its concept and Nasa will decide which lander to test first.Mr Bridenstine said Nasa will go with the company that has the highest probability of success by 2024.Nasa will rely on its own Orion capsules and Space Launch System megarockets - still under development - to launch astronauts to the moon.The two other companies, Boeing and Vivace, put in bids but were eliminated early on, leaving the three awarded contracts.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The Dynetics lander is so low to the ground that only a few steps are needed, like a front porch, a feature that Nasa gave high marks for safety and efficiency.SpaceX is using its own Starship spacecraft - still under development in Texas - and its own rockets. Blue Origin and Dynetics are partnering with numerous subcontractors, including commercial launch companies.Going commercial, Mr Bridenstine said, will drive down costs while increasing access.It builds off of Nasa\u0027s commercial cargo and crew programs for the International Space Station.Just last November, SpaceX and Blue Origin were among the companies that won contracts to make cargo deliveries to the moon.Nasa wants the new Artemis moon-landing programme to be sustainable, unlike Apollo, with multiple missions and multiple locations on the lunar surface.While only one company will carry the first woman and next man to the lunar surface, all three will participate over the long haul, officials noted.By learning how to live and work on another world - the moon - Nasa will be better equipped to eventually send astronauts to Mars, Mr Bridenstine said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Through a range of techniques, we have been able to understand more about its history over the past 9,000 years – but that is a relatively tiny period when compared with the nearly 4.6 billion years the sun has been around.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The reckless endangerment of public safety by greedy social media firms must stop.”A spokesperson for Twitter said it was removing coronavirus-related content “when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm”.“We will not take enforcement action on every tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about Covid-19,” a statement added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’d be very happy if we had enough savings sat in the bank. I don’t know a lot of people who do.“After fighting so hard to be together, we now feel further away from each other and our dreams for our future than ever before.\u0026nbspWe’d love to start a family together, but now have no idea when we’ll be in a position to even live in the same country as each other. We FaceTime everyday but this is not how either of us expected to spend our married life together.”Caroline Coombs, co-founder of Reunite Families UK,\u0026nbspsaid: “The rules by their very nature affect those with less income and so what savings and investments are they expected to access?“Our members have been working hard to try and meet the already challenging minimum income requirement but have now — through no fault of their own — been thrown into huge financial and visa uncertainty. These are people in loving relationships who are, like a lot of people right now, trying to keep their heads above water. This is not helping our families at all, it’s asking the impossible.”The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants\u0026nbspechoed her remarks, saying: “This is absurd. How much do the government think most people have in savings? Let alone people forced to spend thousands on visa applications.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“These are unprecedented times and we have already introduced measures to support people with their immigration status, including automatic extensions of visas and modifying immigration requirements to ensure people are not unduly affected by circumstances beyond their control.“The minimum income requirement for family migration prevents burdens being placed on the taxpayer, but we are keeping family immigration requirements under review and will make adjustments where appropriate and necessary.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The performance has a full production team working behind the scenes and is directed by the award-winner Sam Yates.Money raised from ticket sales will be given to The Felix Project, The Independent’s campaign partner, and to support out-of-work professionals in the theatre industry including a costume designer and a stage manager.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Tom’s play, a comedy set in a private nursing home, follows a seemingly healthy man who attempts to shut himself off from the world. It is the first of the Remote Reads produced by artistic non-profit organisations Platform Presents and Apples and Oranges Arts.Morrissey said: “I’m very excited to be taking part in this live reading. It’s a beautifully written piece by Tom Stoppard and I’m looking forward to performing it.”How to support our campaignThe former Walking Dead villain, who has been volunteering for The Felix Project for about 18 months, praised the charity for “working tirelessly at this very challenging time”.A depot coordinator for The Felix Project commended Morrissey for being “a brilliant ambassador” for the charity.“From his first shift, he was grabbing crates, ing in, just going above and beyond.”\u0026nbspThe Independent launched the Help The Hungry campaign to support the work of The Felix Project in redistributing food to frontline charities, vulnerable iniduals and NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.Sir Tom said: “It’s a delightful surprise to find that a play that I haven’t really thought about for over half a century is getting a new production, especially with such a stunning cast. It’s about the last thing I expected and I’m quite excited about it.“The play was actually written as one half of a 60-minute slot, the other half of which was a documentary about chess players. The idea was that the film and the play would somehow complement each other. The idea was that the man in the play and the chess players were finding some kind of sanctuary in a closed world.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown.

Under the treaty, a decision to extend would have to be made next month at the latest, to give both sides time to prepare for a cliff-edge no-deal.All implementation measures that may require the creation of new facilities (such as new posts for the performance of official controls, or new customs offices) need to commence immediately to ensure that relevant facilities are operational on 1 JanuaryThe commission is also warning that the UK has just 30 days to start a major upgrade of its VAT and customs computer systems that will be needed to process new checks within the country.“Most time-critical is the area of IT systems and databases supporting customs, VAT and excise processes,” the note says.“In order to ensure full functionality and inter-operability of relevant systems by 1 January, commission services and the UK administration need to be working together at full speed and be ready for the necessary technical implementations, which in our technical assessment need to start by 1 June at the very latest.”Discussions are currently taking place on implementing the Northern Ireland protocol on the so-called “joint committee”, an EU-UK body set up by the withdrawal agreement that oversees policies.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

A UK government source close to its negotiating team said the agreement “imposes legal obligations on both sides”.Asked about the note, the Boris Johnson’s\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “The European Commission have chosen to publish its technical note to set out its own views on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. It was not shared at recent meetings with the UK nor has it been agreed by the UK government.“Most strikingly, the note appears to miss out the fundamental objective of the Northern Ireland protocol. There is no mention of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement or the peace process anywhere in this seven-page document.“We are committed to complying with our legal obligations under the protocol, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs. We will continue to take forward discussions on the implementation of the protocol.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

bid to achieve 100,000 daily coronavirus tests by the end of April, with official figures released at Downing Street showing 122,347 tests in the UK on Thursday.But there were accusations that the government had moved the goalposts to achieve the ambitious deadline, by including more than 27,000 home-testing kits at the point they were sent out to members of the public rather than waiting until\u0026nbspthe test has\u0026nbspbeen completed.Thursday’s figure - on the final day of the deadline - represented a leap of more than 18,000 from the previous day’s tally of 81,611.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt brought the total number of antigen tests - which show whether an inidual currently has the illness - over the course of the outbreak to more than a million, though the UK\u0027s\u0026nbsp1,023,824 remains well behind\u0026nbspGermany, where 50,000 were being tested a day as early as\u0026nbspthe start of April.Mr Hancock also announced that he aims to have an army of 18,000 contact tracers in place by mid-May to track down contacts of those shown by tests to be positive for Covid-19.Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock revealed that the total UK\u0026nbspdeath toll has risen to 27,510 over the course of the outbreak, with 739 fatalities in all settings on Thursday.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers

total, which was at about 10,000 when Mr Hancock set his target at the start of April and was hovering around 20,000 little more than a week ago, was rapidly increased over the past few days with the

sent to satellite sites within the health service, which were counted on dispatch rather than after they have been returned to labs and analysed.Mr Hancock heralded the expansion in testing as an “incredible achievement”.He said: “I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal, because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet.”He praised his team for working “tirelessly… with grit and determination” to reach the goal.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out. Tonight’s headline figure shouldn’t count tests that hadn’t been used -\u0026nbspor indeed, might never be used - as a completed test. Ministers promised transparency - the public and NHS staff deserve clarity.“In any event, this figure was never a strategy. We need a fully resourced testing, isolation and tracing programme and ministers should be using this lockdown time to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.”Mr Hancock said that the testing capacity now available was “crucial to suppress the virus” and would “help us to unlock the lockdown”.It would be backed up by an initial 18,000 contact-tracers to be in place by the middle of May, with more to be recruited if required.“The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new Covid-19 NHS app, will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections,” he said.Speaking a day after prime minister Boris Johnson promised a “roadmap” out of lockdown, Mr Hancock said: “In recent weeks we’ve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones and yet our goal must be freedom.“Freedom from the virus, yes - and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so - but also we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too – each citizen’s right to do as they please.“For now, we’re working together to stay home, we’re impinging on the freedom of all for the safety of all.“With this next mission of test, track and trace, I’m seeking a solution that allows us, by each of us participating, to target the measures that are needed with much more precision and so to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all.”Prof Newton rejected suggestions that the UK’s slow adoption of mass testing had “kept us in lockdown a day longer”.Stay-at-home measures were introduced in March not because of a lack of tests but because of the wide circulation of the Covid-19 virus in the population, he said.“Cases were popping up with no obvious connection to other cases and the infection was entering the exponential growth phase and at that point access to limitless testing even if we had had it would’ve made no difference,” he said.“The decision to enter into lockdown would have been the same and would’ve been taken at the same time.“In the same way the route out of lockdown has not been blocked by low levels of testing. We can relax social distancing only when the Government’s five tests are met, and that means particularly getting the infection rate right down.“Testing will help to keep it out of control once we’re out of lockdown but our levels of testing have not kept us in lockdown a day longer.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Any decision about summer school would be decided later in May, he added.Schools shut down in March as the coronavirus quickly spread through the state and inundated the healthcare system.In response to the closures, teachers switched to virtual learning while schools found ways to still deliver meals and assist with childcare for essential workers during the pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Cuomo recently extended its NY Pause, the state’s form of stay-at-home order, through 15 May but did not discuss what would happen to schools until his official announcement on Friday.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“We don’t think it’s possible to reopen schools in a way that would keep our children and students and educators safe,” Mr Cuomo said.The governor and his office also asked schools to come up with a plan for how they can continue social distancing measures in the autumn. But no one could provide information on what exactly this would look like.New York City\u0026nbspSchools chancellor Richard\u0026nbspCarranza\u0026nbsptold principals during a phone call this week that there was a “50-50” chance that facilities would open in September to welcome the new academic year, the New York Post reported.“We are moving full steam ahead for a September opening of schools, but always planning for any eventuality,” Mr\u0026nbspCarranza\u0026nbspadded in a Tweet shared on Wednesday. “Grateful every day for the hard work of all of our dedicated educators and support staff in serving our 1.1 million students.”Decisions to keep schools closed through the academic school year comes as New York continues to flatten its\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbspcurve.In the last couple of weeks, the state’s reported a decline in hospitalisations and death rates due to the novel virus.On Friday, the state reported 289 new deaths, which is the lowest number of deaths in a single day from Covid-19 in weeks.

Yet on the other side of the world, South Korea has witnessed nothing like the same devastation.To date, there have been just  deaths in the Asian nation, and only , cases - barely a tenth of the British total.While Britain remains in the grip of the storm, South Korea is already emerging from the darkness.What makes this phenomenal gap all the more remarkable is the country’s closeness to China, the initial global centre of the pandemic - which should have left South Korea - a country of  million people - far more vulnerable than Britain to the ravages of the disease.But the South Korean authorities took this seriously, through their prompt action and ruthless efficiency, they quickly managed to get the virus under control.On  February, there had been  new cases, but this daily figure fell dramatically in the subsequent two months, dropping to single digits last week.Amid all the gloom across the earth, South Korea’s astonishing success is a beacon the world.And its achievement is particularly impressive because the nation has not resorted to Chinese or European-style lockdowns.Most of the population has not been placed under effective house arrest, nor has the economy been put into a medically-induced coma.Under strict rules about social distancing, bars, cafes, shops and hotels have remained open.One British journalist based in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, told me that he even had to queue last week for a table at a restaurant in a fashionable district, something that would be unthinkable in Britain.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before . And there were a group of comedians who’ve been forced on us, since then, who aren’t comedians at all. At best, they’re pub-funny show-offs — at worst they’re political propagandists trying to bend us to their will.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The contrast could not have been better illustrated by the segment where modern Mash Report types and old-school stand-ups were given about ten seconds to make us laugh and the only one who could nail it was Tim Vine, who appeared with a placard reading “Bad” and a punchline: “That’s not a good sign is it.”An actual punchline! On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours. Less is more, guys.TV astrologer Russell Grant made this uncanny  prediction, for those of us born in the star sign Cancer, late last year, in the Mirror.“Travel is on the cards in the spring and as much as you enjoy your home le, you will appreciate this change of scene.”Yeah, the Sainsbury’s queue was a blast, thanks Russ.“It’s not just The Big Night In, April  is, of course . . .”A St George’s Day B Shakespeare’s birthday C Darren Huckerby’s birthday It was D “The start of Ramadan.”The clue being in the letters BBC, of course.THE Dave channel has been attempting to ease the nation’s ever-present mental health worries via the gt of laughter.A noble cause and a good idea.Unfortunately, they’ve given the all-important job to some of the worst comedians in Britain.Last week, it was the turn of Nish Kumar, Suzi Ruffell, Seann Walsh and Darren Harriott, whose attempts to end Britain’s silent suffering were ided into two separate and contrasting segments.In the first, backstage, they discussed their own experiences of mental health issues, which sounded more like a lot of really bad hangovers, egotism and self-pity, while making the usual heartfelt pleas for tolerance, understanding and a constructive dialogue.’Cos, you know, they’re alive to the fact they’re meant to care.Then Kumar and Ruffell went out on stage and spewed vile, angry foul-mouthed hatred about Boris, Trump, Top Gear, Richard Hammond , fellow comedians and anyone who’s got what Ruffell calls “lazy opinions”.That is to say, anyone who has the temerity to hold a dferent political opinion to her own.Not a single word of it was funny, let alone healing.Darren Harriott, the least worst of them, though, did at least have the decency to provide the necessary cue.“I struggle to give people all of me ’cos I’m always worried they’re going to go, they’re going to disappear and . . .”Click.He’s got a point, hasn’t he.Paul Merson: “Bournemouth seem to keep coming up without answers.”Micah Richards: “The way he carried his body language was outstanding.”Matt Le Tissier: “Spurs are never going to win the league in a million years. Not at the moment anyway.”.IT was mild-mannered Jack Maynard who summed up John Fashanu’s many foibles best, after the former footballer had tried throttling DJ Locksmith on Channel ’s Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins.“Number four,” he said, with some feeling, “is a t**t.” He is indeed. He’s not the only one on that show, either. There’s strong competition to be the biggest one from Bluto-ish oaf Tony Bellew, the former world cruiserweight boxing champion, who’s got an even shorter fuse than Fashanu.Both have already been called in for fairly urgent “questioning” by the SAS instructors who always hold the whip hand during these interrogations as, at the first hint of vanity, derangement, pretension or self-delusion, Ant Middleton can shout “GUARD!” and Billy bundles them off with a hood over their head.If it was just a hardman staring contest, of course, the show wouldn’t work. But it’s not. Sometimes the Special Forces team are staring at contestants like “YouTuber” Jack Maynard, trying to get their heads around what the hell it is he actually does for a living.“I will come up with some video idea and I direct, film, edit and present the thing myself.”Billy : “So you’re actually a smart f***er.”There are also emerging friendships, hidden tensions, a lot of honest endeavour and a simmering feud between Paralympian Lauren Steadman and Joey Essex, which erupts on next week’s show .SAS: Who Dares Wins will have to proceed, though, without Katie Price, who quit after a feeble two-day effort, and Anthea Turner, who tried getting all philosophical just before she threw in her armband. “I feel I am in what the Japanese call my second spring.”Fetch the hood, Billy.MEANWHILE, over on episode two of I’ll Get This, Jermaine Jenas says to Sara Pascoe: “I’ll be waiting for the comedian in you to come out.”So we’ll check up on him again in November .C’s SAS: Who Dares Wins.

So you can get nests cropping up in all sorts of places youre likely to come near to.Any large expanse of roof — including houses, flats and warehouses — could potentially offer nice protected sites for gulls to go and nest on.And thats a concern at the moment because although it depends on the species, nesting typically starts around mid-April and tends to peak around May.They’re starting to look for nesting sites now.The potential risk is thatthe site is on lockdown and it’s quiet with no human activity, gulls may feel comfortable nesting at there and start establishing nests before any deterrent can be implemented.And that could lead to a long-term problem too.Herring gulls, for example, sexually mature in about four years and can live for up to  years.So typically the young will disappear for four years — they’ll go off to the coast or inland refuse tips — but then theyll come back to the same nesting site.And they’ll use the same spot year on year, so the numbers will gradually increaseinterventions aren’t put in place.Theres all sorts of things we can do to deter gulls — but the lockdown means some of them are a bit trickier.In terms of lethal controls, they should always be a very last resort and the Government has restricted what we can do because all gulls have a level of legal protection.So instead we have to look at things like good proofing , good site management, and hawking.Thats where a trained hawker will use a predator bird, typically a Harriss hawk, to fly in the vicinity of where the pest gulls are.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

After days of hysterical commentary about increased car usage, the official slides at the Government briefing this week showed it had actually gone down.Is it any wonder that trust in telly journalists, with their constant gotcha questions of ministers and desire to do down our national effort, is plummeting So let me say this in Britain’s biggest newspaper that has maintained the loyalty of our brilliant army of readers with hysteria-free coverage: We have done so well and all deserve to be applauded for our stoic efforts to flatten the curve.Even at the start of March, nobody could have imagined that the UK would spend six weeks without the Premier League, McDonald’s or nightclubs Let alone losing those joys of our national le at a time when everyone other than key workers had to stay at home.You’ve missed weddings, births, signicant birthdays, important operations and even funerals. That’s why I am so proud of the citizens of this country.Do not let anyone tell you that the UK didn’t take this evil disease seriously. We did. Unquestionably.But that doesn’t mean we should now stay silent and accept a continued loss of our freedom and liberties.

Make it with orange juice and a g serving of fruit jelly sees you tick off  per cent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin C.It is also a rich source of folate, which you need for healthy nerves.Not only that, oranges and orange juice give us the super-nutrient hesperitin, which can help with your bone health and immune system.Scientists in Italy say it can also help to lower bad cholesterol, while boosting good cholesterol, reduce inflammation and bring down blood pressure.These provide a sixth of your daily recommended fibre and more than a quarter of your vitamin C, which is vital for immunity and good skin.A g serving has  calories, less than a portion of fries.A store cupboard staple, rice pudding is a rich source of copper and iodine, for healthy skin and metabolism, and bone-building calcium.A g portion has g of protein, g of fat and just  calories.You don’t need it to be Christmas for an excuse to get out the cheeseboard. And there’s even more reason to now that stilton is a superfood.The bacteria Penicillium roqueforti, which creates the blue veins and characteristic flavour, produces metabolites that boost your health, according to scientists.Lab tests revealed the compound andrastin produces anti-tumor molecules and mycophenolic acid, which is an anti-fungal super-nutrient.But watch your serving size as it is high in fat and calories.Stick with a sensible g wedge and you will have just  calories and .g fat.Beanz meanz . . . high in protein. A g serving – half a shop-bought can – has around g, about the same as you would find in an egg.And just three heaped tablespoons of beans makes up one of your five-a-day.They are also high in fibre, giving you a third of your g recommended daily intake, much of which is soluble, meaning it attracts water and makes you feel fuller for longer. So less temptation to snack between meals.Baked beans are packed with iron, with g giving you more than a oz grilled steak.Another benefit is they are super cheap.These are simply hard-boiled eggs that have been preserved in distilled vinegar once cooled.The white of each pickled egg contains g of protein, just half of what a ml serving of milk contains.Not only are they filling, the eggs are rich in vitamin D, needed to absorb calcium for strong bones, B for healthy nerves, iodine for a good metabolism and selenium for immunity.All this goodness is packed into less than  calories per egg.Chop up a bunch of cabbage, onion and carrot and combine with low-fat mayonnaise for a coleslaw full of antioxidant ­carotenes and sulphur-based super nutrients.Eat g for one of your five-a-day.Filling ravioli in a tomato sauce is rich in antioxidant lycopene, linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.It boasts iron and has just  calories in a g serving, with g fat and g protein. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

reopen now that the UK is past the peak of the pandemic.And he thanked the nation for staying at home so that the NHS can now once again help to create new lives.Sharing some really good news at the Downing Street press conference, he said: Earlier this week I said that we are now able to bring the restoration of NHS services.Few families have been untouched by the amazing advances in fertility treatments over the past generation and I know just how time-sensitive treatment can be and how important it is for the families affected.And I know that this treatment can change lives for the better forever.So when I say thank you for all of you, everybody watching, for staying at home to protect the NHS of course Im saying thank you on behalf of the lives that youre saving.But Im also saying thanks on behalf of the lives that the NHS can now once again help to create.The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid fertility clinics across the UK can apply to reopen from May they ensure the safety and protection of staff and patients.Mr Hancock said strict guidelines will ensure staff and patients remain safe.Fertility services were temporarily suspended on March   in response to the coronavirus lockdown.While many private clinics may be able to restart services quickly, the Department of Health and Social Care said it recognises that NHS clinics may need more time to achieve the necessary conditions due to factors including the redeployment of staff in frontline roles.Therefore, Mr Hancock will write to all CCGs this week to confirm they are able to begin resuming fertility treatments to those in their area, either through a private clinic or an NHS service, to ensure fair provision.NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners are drawing up guidance for CCGs to put in place a framework for resuming services.The new guidance will allow clinics to reopen onlythey can prove measures to protect staff and patients are in place and will mean iniduals and couples looking to start fertility treatment will be able to safely continue to do so.Social distancing will be required in waiting rooms, telephone appointments could be used where suitable and appropriate Personal Protective Equipment will also be provided where necessary, the Department for Health and Social Care said.An auditing tool will be used to ensure clinics are complying with the guidelines.Mr Hancock added:People who are relying on fertility treatment have been worried during these unprecedented times not knowing when they could continue their journey to start a family.We wanted to open these clinics as soon as it was safe to do so, and our strict guidelines will ensure staff and patients remain safe as we continue to tackle this virus.Sally Cheshire, chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said: I am pleased that the HFEA has agreed fertility clinics can apply to reopen from May .Our priority throughout the pandemic has been to consider how treatment could resume quickly and safely for as many patients as possible and our clear plan sets out how clinics can treat and care for patients safely during the continuing Covid- pandemic.I know that the closure of clinics has been extremely distressing for patients and this will be good news for those wanting to resume treatment and have the opportunity to try for their much longed for family.Geeta Nargund, lead consultant for Reproductive Medicine at St Georges Hospital NHS Trust, added:We are delighted that IVF services are opening soon.We thank the Government for recognising the distress faced by thousands of women and couples across our nation and acting swtly to help them.We must ensure that effective social distancing and safety measures are put in place so that we can not only help save lives but start creating lives again.During todays press briefing, Mr Hancock also confirmed that the UK had passed its , coronavirus testing target.Mr Hancock set the ambitious target earlier this month as part of a promise to increase the numbers of tests being done.He has expanded the criteria meaning that million NHS staff, key workers and others who need to leave the house to go to their job can now get a test.Yesterday Boris Johnson revealed that the country was , short of the target, and had tested , on the second to last day before the target had to be met.Testing is seen as being the first stage of a plan to end the lockdown.More testing will be set up, followed by an extensive track and trace programme to target anyone who may have been in contact with the killer bug.Boris Johnson tweeted this morning an appeal for Brits to stay on track and work together to beat the bug.He said: I can confirm that we are past the peak of this disease.We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope.And we have so many reasons to be hopeful for the long term.But we can only defeat coronavirus by our collective discipline and working together.To receive The Suns Coronavirus

Especially when you are dealing with a government like China’s.As viewers of the series Chernobyl know, non-democratic governments have a history of covering up their errors.In that case, the Soviets did everything they could to stop the world learning about the meltdown at their nuclear reactor.Today the Communist Party of China has done everything it can to hide what happened in Wuhan. Especially the origins of the disease which has shut down the world.Yesterday President Trump broke one of the taboos in all this. Which is needed.The question is: What is the likelihood the coronavirus originated in the exact part of China that has a laboratory looking into just such viruses To date the Chinese authorities have allowed the world to believe in the bat-eating, wet-market theory on the origins of the epidemic.They prefer embarrassment over suspicion.But all along, people have wondered whether something less “accidental” is at play.Now the US President has told reporters he has seen strong evidence that Covid- originated from the laboratory in Wuhan. The President’s remarks change the game.China should be in enough trouble as it is. Evenit was true that the virus is an accident caused by a strange food custom, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot to answer for.Why did it keep the news of the virus to itself for so many weeks  Why did it pretend it is not lethal as we now know it is Or pretend that it was hard to transmit  Why did they refuse to allow in inspectors from the World Health Organisation And why have the WHO now been refused inclusion in China’s own investigation into the origins of Covid- Questions also remain over the WHO’s seeming collusion with China over the crisis.The CCP’s actions would be bad enoughthe virus came from a wet market. But it must know that it is in a whole dferent realm of troublethe virus turns out to have come from its lab.If the CCP knew all along the virus had leaked from there then its cover-up is even more appalling. Because it means they knew exactly what they — and soon the world — were dealing with.But in the absence of trust-worthy information, darker and wilder theories take shape in the shadows. For example, could the virus have come from the Wuhan lab and been released deliberately To those deeply skeptical of the CCP, it’s not hard to believe it might have done that.They are in a trade war with America with a President who was making them lose. Now the CCP has managed to shut down the entire US economy with a virus.The question for the rest of the world will soon be simple: What to do about this There are several steps. The first is to try to determine exactly how this virus came about. To have an international  look into every possible cause. With no area of inquiry ruled out.That  should also investigate how the communist regime lied their way through this virus. We need to learn just how they managed to make a local problem into a global one.Then there is the question of what price they should pay. For accidental or not, there is no way that the CCP should be allowed to get away with this.Goodness knows they have tried. Throughout this crisis there have been a set of PR gestures by the Chinese authorities.The government and government-linked firms such as Huawei have made a big show of donating masks and other equipment.It is dismal. Like watching somebody who has just burned down your house offering you a watering can.Last month, German newspaper Bild infuriated China by suggesting Beijing should pay reparations for the coronavirus pandemic.It printed an “invoice’ for nearly billion eurosleading the Chinese embassy in Berlin to accuse the paper of stirring up prejudice.But once the engine of the other global economies — including ours — roars back into motion, we must make China pay.We must re-think our relationship with them. We should recognise the country is not just a competitor but a liability.We must punish them for the large-scale theft of information from British and American businesses it has engaged in for years.We must do whatever we can to disrupt their “belt-and-road” empire-building, which the CCP has worked its way into, and “bought up” small and poor countries.But it is not only such countries that are at the mercy of China and its President Xi Jinping. We may be in Britain too.Before this Wuhan disaster kicked off, our Government approved Huawei to provide part of our G capability.All of our allies warned against this. Our intelligence-sharing partners in the Five Eyes networkall strongly warned the British Government against allowing a firm that is indistinguishable from the CCP from having such access.Experience shows Chinese firms cannot be trusted to provide such sensitive — and strategic — technology.The Huawei decision was a rare misstep by the Johnson government. Now is the time to correct it.We do not need to provoke China. But nor do we need to pander to it. And we should not be putting our future security in their hands.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Living by the sea, in paradise, with a triangular- torsoed Hollywood hunk.But thenyou take a glance at your social media, you’ll notice that absolutely everyone  is living the Hemsworth dream.It’s an endless parade of people’s perfect sourdough baking and of jolly board games with the kids.This morning, my Instagram feed featured a young family doing a fancy dress dinner, a girl on an enormous horse, a woman sprawled on the bonnet of a Mercedes SL, a man with a cute dog, doing exercises, and a shot of some cows taken through a wisteria bush.On Instagram, no one is ever bored, it never rains and everyone’s breasts are perfect. Especially Chris Hemsworth’s.This is having an effect on the nation’s teenagers. They have been told there will be no exams this year and that all their school work was for nothing. They’ve been told they have to stay indoors and that they can’t see their friends.And it’s driving them mad because they do not read newspapers. They do not listen to the BBC news. And they replaced Radio  with Spoty five years ago.This means they never hear any actual news. So they don’t know what’s going on.Instead they look at their phonesand all they can see are pretty girls with swimsuits up their a*** cheeks, and Chris Hemsworth, and parents who have turned the cellar into a nightclub and lots of cute ducklings.And they’re thinking, as they watch the rain trickle down the windows at their house: “Why can’t I have some of that ”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

So I’ve come up with another idea . . .If you are an old person stuck in a tower block, waiting for Covid- to stick its warty little head through the letterbox, post a picture of your surroundings on Instagram. Don’t hold back. Show us the overflowing cat litter and the photograph of your husband, alone in his hospital bed.Show us also pictures of your sister who is in a care home and hasn’t had a visitor for five weeks.And your food cupboard which has nothing in it any more. And your empty bottle of Senokot.In fact, we should all get in on the act. Don’t wait for a joyous moment to photograph and share. Send us instead pictures of stuff you didn’t enjoy.The particularly gruesome bit of wax you’ve just pulled out of your left ear. The turd your dog just did on the mat. Your fat other half slobbing out in front of the TV.Your kids throwing Monopoly pieces at one another after a row over Fenchurch Street station.Instead of sharing your perfect loaf, send pictures of the charred wreck that went wrong, the scarf full of dropped stitches, the wonky self-assembly garden furniture that broke the first time you sat on it.Hit us with the reality of lockdown. Admit that it’s one part happiness and nine parts ditch water.And then maybe teenagers will start to understand that le is bookended by the lucky and the not so lucky. At one end you’ve got the Hemsworths. At the other you’ve got a frightened old man in a tenement block in Bermondsey.Maybe then they will understand they are somewhere in the middle, and stop bloody complaining.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.There is much debate about what increases your chances of dying from Covid-.Well, I don’t know about you but I’ve addressed the issue by sitting on a sofa for six hours a day, eating slabs of Cadbury’s Fruit  Nut chocolate and getting up only to go to the fridge for another bottle of wine.I guess I’m working on the principle that soon I’ll be so fat, there won’t be room in the house for me and the virus as well.But there is one problem.There are now so many empty bottles sitting by the bins at the bottom of the drive I just know my neighbours will assume I’ve been throwing illegal parties, and call the police.A nurse made headlines this week after moaning about the cramped conditions on a London Tube train at .am.She said she was risking her le at work and pointed out that she shouldn’t have to risk it even more while commuting. Fair point, you might think. But hang on.In the olden days – before March – people may well have been on a Tube train at that time because they were coming home from a club.But these days, nobody on a Tube train at quarter to six in the morning is there for fun. They’re ALL going to work.There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what most of us have been told to do all along. But I do agree that commuting on a cramped Tube is bloody dangerous.So I ask once again for parking restrictions to be lted immediately, as this would allow people to go to work in the blissful self-isolation of their own cars.An aerial photo- graph of Portsmouth taken this week showed that the colour of the sea has turned from the usual mud brown to a shimmering, aquamarine blue.It’s the sort of colour you usually associate with the Caribbean, and it is genuinely amazing.Naturally, green people are saying it happened because the lockdown means less traffic.

His anger was in response to Conservative former Cabinet minister David Gaukeaposs defence of reductions in public spending, warning of an even more dficult situation without austerity as he tried to focus on resilience. But the Bristol University professor told BBC Newsnight: I think thataposs nonsenseI may be so bold. The resilience has been stripped systematically out of the system, you cannot, when a big problem like this hits, you canapost just reinvent things and put them back the way you wish they were. If you make the system as lean and emaciated as it is there will not be the public health staff there, there will not be the health visitors, there will not be the environmental health officers and you canapost magic them up out of nowhere. Simply testing key workers, health service workers and the over s really wonapost cut it, so it needs to be a comprehensive programme, he added. Meanwhile, Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of biomedical research centre the Francis Crick Institute, labelled the Governmentaposs target of , coronavirus tests per day a PR stunt.  On April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to reach the target by the end of the month. However only , tests were carried out on Tuesday. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Sir Paul said there had been no visible strategy behind the , target. It was, as far as Iaposm concerned, a bit of a PR stunt which has gone a bit wrong, he said. Where was the strategy under that  I havenapost seen a strategy under it. It just sounded good. Sir Paul added that the Government missed the opportunity to make hospitals safer by mass testing healthcare workers regardless of whether they were showing symptoms. If we had had local testing connected to local hospitals, we could have made hospitals a safe place, he said.what we had is the potential for having care workers working on the wards, working with sick patients who were carrying the disease and werenapost being tested. They had such restricted rules on who could be tested that they didnapost simply make the decision that we have to test everybody that is a frontline worker and, in particular, they wouldnapost test anybody who had no symptoms. We were allowing potentially for frontline care workers to be on the wards potentially infecting people because we werenapost testing. Now that may have been because they didnapost have testing capacity throughout the country but you canapost simply say we donapost need to do it because we donapost have testing capacity and even when we could provide testing capacity we couldnapost do it because of the NHS rules. Testing was absolutely critical, it hasnapost been handled properly.

At this afternoonaposs daily coronavirus briefing Matt Hancock faced two questions from the public. The first asked whether parents would be fined for not sending their children to school when learning centres are re-opened. Mr Hancock vowed the Government would only allow pupils towhen it was safe to do so - and did not rule out the prospect of fines. He said: We are not going to re-open schoolsit isnapost safe. Of course, as and when we re-open schools, our goal is to get back to the norm and the position as it was before. Iaposm confident, because weaposll only do it when it is safe, it will at that point be entirely reasonable and normal again to send your children to school. Prof Powis added: The science is still evolving in terms of transmission between children, so we do need to be cautious as we think of re-opening schools and we will need to think carefully and advise the Government with appropriate information about how that can happen.  Currently only the children of key workers go to schools with most children being homeschooled. The other public question was about using Nightingale hospitals to reduce NHS waiting times. Professor Stephen Powis said NHS Nightingale hospitals will need to be kept as an insurance policy in the next month or two until a sustained reduction in hospital admissions is assured. Mr Hancock said the Government will do what we need to do to reduce NHS waiting lists as we reopen the NHS. Mr Hancock added: But the Nightingales were designed very specically for patients who are intubated and therefore who are under anaesthetic. So they are specically designed for Covid.

An urgent investigation was launched tonight into AGO Outsourcing, which had around  staff working on the National Shielding Helpline as a subcontractor of Serco. Workers at the firmaposs call centre in East Kilbride were told “there may be occasions” where bosses cannot keep two metres between them. Yet those taking a £-an-hour job on the helpline - which helps .million vulnerable people in England staying at home - were asked to sign a waiver, absolving the firm of any blamethey get sick. Approached for comment yesterday by the Mirror, a senior AGO manager said some staff spend a whole sht sitting between one and two metres apart. He insisted the firm was following social distancing rules - because Scottish guidelines say there are some circumstances where key workers may sit between one and two metres apart. But after we approached the UK government for comment this afternoon, it asked Serco to launch an urgent investigation within hours. AGO then withdrew the waiver after a request by Serco, a government spokesman said. Late tonight, the government then said Serco had suspended AGO from taking part in the helpline calls entirely pending the outcome of the investigation.  A government spokeswoman told the Mirror: “We take these allegations extremely seriously and have asked our contractor Serco to urgently investigate. We understand they have already asked AGO to withdraw the waiver. We set high standards for our contract providers which explicitly stipulate coronavirus workplace guidance must be followed at all times.”According to the document seen by the Mirror, staff were asked to sign below the words: “I hereby understand that there may be a risk to my health where there is a shortfall in the recommended  metre social distancing. “I also agree that any continuity to work under these conditions are purely my choice and I accept that no liability lies with AGO.” Branded with AGO’s logo and the words “ethics, positivity, passion, professionalism, respect”, the document added: “Whilst we will work hard to ensure employees have all tools to protect themselves, AGO excludes liability for any detriment, deterioration in health or any claims that may arise due to the shortfall in the  metre recommended social distance.” UK social distancing guidelines say people should keep two metres apart to stop the spread of Covid-. But when we approached AGO for comment yesterday, chief operations manager Stephen Rafferty said the firm was following guidelines by the Scottish government.  Those rules say workers must be kept two metres apart where possible, but“the task is essential, the distance between workers can be reduced to no less than one metre.” Mr Rafferty told the Mirror the firm is “very strict in operating within the guidelines” and took “a lot of measures” to keep staff safe - but he insisted that as “key workers”, staff can be kept as little as one metre apart. He also defended the waiver - saying staff knew they would be at some risk when they took the job. One person who worked inside the centre claimed working conditions were “atrocious”. They told the Mirror: “I’m spending all day on the phone to people that are obviously scared and vulnerable, saying don’t you go outside, keep your distance, you are not supposed to see family, you are not supposed to see friends. The insider claimed “multiple people” had complained about working conditions, but many signed the waiver because they needed cash. “Quite a few people who took up a job have been desperate for money because they missed the government’s furlough scheme,” they said. The line helps .million people in England who have been told to avoid all social contact - including those with cancer and cystic fibrosis. Call handlers check on their welfare and whether they have enough food and medicine.  Photos seen by the Mirror appear to show each call handler working in a small booth separated by iders which do not reach the top of all workers’ heads. Mr Rafferty claimed “maybe one, two headsyou’re lucky” stick out but said some people had their chairs pumped up too high. The undated photos also do not show staff wearing masks, but Mr Rafferty insisted masks and gloves are available to all staff. The insider told the Mirror that on the day sht, they had only seen cleaners come round once per day at around pm. Mr Rafferty said this was untrue, and that cleaners came three times a day - disinfecting work stations, door handles, kitchen areas and more. Mr Rafferty said workers’ booths were “just above the metre” apart in some cases. Asked to confirmworkers’ desks and chairs are between one and two metres apart, all day long, he replied: “Some of them are.” But he defended the distance saying people were “fully shielded”. He added: “The guidelines state that that’s what we should do and that is what we do. We’re very strict in operating within the guidelines. We do not breach the guidelines.” Mr Rafferty added the firm “consulted legal advice” before drawing up the waiver, saying: “We didn’t take any existing employees and say ‘ you want paid, you need to work, and you need to sign this so we’re off the hook’.” He added: “Every single person working here has been onboarded specically for this project, so the call centre was empty.

They could start in the White House with that inadequate ball of self-love telling the American people his genius brain had devised a way to beat the killer virus he first dismissed as a hoax. By injecting bleach into their lungs. Works in a minute, folks. They could look at the mini Stalins running China, who turned into an army of Billy Liars, telling the world not to worry just because a few old folks had gone outside in Wuhan with wet hair and caught a mild case of the snfles. So move on down the ­rickshaw, folks. When asked for advice, the World Health Organisation, petried of losing its funding, pointed at Beijing and muttered “er, yeah, what they said”. Populist leaders like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro urged his people to dance the samba in time to their sneezing in packed shopping malls while Boris Johnson initially decreed we should face it the Eton way by taking the killer droplets on the chin and letting it spread through the lower-class herd. In the face of a man-made disaster they should have seen coming, the supposed leaders of the world were caught in a state of denial. As veteran Tory MP Bernard Jenkin put it: “Some things are so awful to contemplate you just carry on doing normal things. We all knew a pandemic was a top threat. We just hoped it wouldn’t happen.” Chilling words that should convince young people who don’t already get it, that these old world leaders, with short-term interests, are playing Russian roulette with their futures. For the past few years activists have been warning that those charged with protecting the planet either refuse to see the truth about the looming environmental apocalypse or are deliberately ignoring it. Schoolkids were ridiculed for going on strike, Green politicians patronised, Extinction Rebellion vilied and Greta Thunberg became the pin-up hate girl for right-wing mouth-frothers. But observing the same world leaders, who are on the record for refuting man-made climate change and in denial about this man-made pandemic, their fears surely ring true.

Formula  engineer Joe Sturdy is also lined up to talk youngsters through his path from school to the most exclusive racing grids in the world.  Oliver Fisher, co-founder of SPRINGPOD, said: Itaposs clear that science is very much the aposcoolapos subject at school. We should be delighted to see so many youngsters wanting to pursue the worldaposs most exciting, innovative, and forward-thinking roles that will change the future of a generation. Despite more men wanting to enter into engineering roles, itaposs interesting to note that last year girls overtook boys for the first time when it came to studying science at A-level, after decades to reduce the gap. The s are set to be a renaissance period for female scientists.  Employability continues to be a hot topic with youngsters, so weaposve partnered with Marks  Spencer, Price Waterhouse Cooper, and many more to run sessions on how to standout to get the job. The survey of  young adults, by OnePoll for SPRINGPOD, also revealed almost one in five donapost know the skills and qualications for their dream career.

It comes after the high street coffee chain - which closed all branches when the UK went into lockdown on March  -  opened two branches for delivery and two for drive-thru last week. Costa CEO Jill McDonald said: Last week we made the decision to re-open two Drive-Thru lanes and two stores for delivery only in line with the latest Government advice. The safety of our team members and customers is our number one priority and ahead of these stores re-opening, we put in place new social distancing guidelines, enhanced hygiene procedures and are providing teams with personal protective equipment. We have been really pleased with how well our stores teams have been able to adapt to our new ways working, allowing us to serve great coffee, as safely as possible. We have also received some great feedback from our customers and key workers taking advantage of enjoying a well-deserved coffee break whilst on essential journeys to or from work. We will be increasing the number of Drive-Thru lanes and stores open for delivery via Uber Eats from tomorrow . Over the past month, the coffee chain has kept some stores inside hospitals open to serve NHS staff. From May ,  of the branches will be open for delivery, while  will be drive-thru only.

He said UK airports should follow countries in Asia which have introduced screening measures, temperature checks and improved hygiene procedures. Passengers may also be required to wear masks during flights. Mr Holland Kaye added: The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. For live updates about coronavirus, follow our live blog. Travellers could also be told to arrive up to four hours ahead of their departure time to allow for extra measures, such as being swabbed and tested for the virus before being able to go through security. Independent aviation analysts have said planes would have to be fully disinfected after every flight, meaning ticket prices could increase. Low-cost airline Wizz Air was to resume some flights from Luton airport on Friday, with passengers required to wear face masks. Crew will also wear masks and will keep a distance between passengers during boarding. Rail travel The Rail Delivery Group is coordinating the rail industryaposs response to the pandemic. It said services will continue to run on a reduced timetable and passengers will be given clear advice about how to stay two metres apart. Changes to travel will be made following the Governmentaposs advice and train companies will remind customers of the action they need to take while using their services.  Great Western Railway has said it is looking to increase services from mid-May, with further increases when the Government starts to ease the lockdown. Elsewhere, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was zero chance of increasing transport services soon, amid speculation of a rise in journeys on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due. Industry sources said last week no dates have yet been agreed or announced. Pubs and restaurants Major takeaway chains such as KFC, Burger King and Pret A Manger started reopening a few branches this week. They have introduced strict safety and social distancing measures including regular handwashing and sanitising every  minutes. There are also restrictions on the amount of customers allowed in a store at the same time. Costa Coffee is reopening some branches - only for delivery or drive-thru - and has put in place measures to protect staff and customers - such as new social distancing guidelines, enhanced hygiene procedures and personal protective equipment for team members.Meanwhile, pubs are braced for large numbers of people eager to visit their locals when they reopen again. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: At this stage it is dficult to say when pubs are expected to reopen and what the future of the pub looks like. We are looking to the Government to provide us more detail on when pubs can go back to business and how they will be able to operate. Our members take the safety of their staff very seriously, when pubs reopen our members will be considering as a matter of the highest priority how to keep staff and customers safe while maintaining the pub experience.It has also been reported that pub landlords may be asked to ration alcohol after the coronavirus lockdown, with a two or three pint limit for customers.The All Party Parliamentary Group for Hospitality and Tourism has also launched an urgent inquiry into how the sectors could reopen. Sport Ongoing discussions have taken place about sporting events restarting following lockdown, with fixtures being played behind closed doors. It has been reported that Premier League matches could be played without spectators for a period of time. Weekly meetings are being held involving senior medical directors of the major sports in a bid toto action as soon as possible.  The issue is also set to be raised when ministers review current measures. Testing, social distancing, hygiene standards and strict limits on the numbers of people allowed in venues would all be debated. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told MPs that he had been having productive talkswith governing bodies from across British sport. Workplaces Businesses could be made to put up signs asking workers to stay two metres apart from one another and instruct staff to leavethey have symptoms of Covid-, it has been reported. Companies will also be told to close communal spaces such as canteens,workers are unable to socially distance themselves, and to ensure there are hand-washing facilities, hand gel and PPE supplies readily available.  Property services provider CBRE has said British firms should look to Asia as a guide on how offices might approach reopening in the future. It advises against a full throttleto work, with social-distancing measures needing to be reduced gradually and in line with public health guidance. Theatres and cinemas It is unclear how theatres and cinemas will begin reopening after the lockdown is lted and firms will need to decide how to maintain social distancing in venues where hundreds of people are in close proximity. Options have included keeping every other seat empty - which could have a financial impact on smaller venues - or checking the temperature of customers before they enter. In the meantime, theatre productions and new release films have been streamed online. Gyms Humphrey Cobbold, chief executive of PureGym, told BBC Radio aposs Today Programme the chain was working to upgrade the hygiene and sanitisation regime to ensure customersapos safety when facilities are allowed to reopen again. He said: The right approach is a considered and careful opening. We will probably, when permitted by government, start by opening half a dozen sites and then expand from there when weaposre confident that we have a model thataposs safe and secure for members for the future. Elsewhere, Virgin Active will inform customers when they will reopen clubs once it is safe to do so based on government advice. Gym members could also be asked to perform frequent hand-washing during visits.  Shopping In the coming weeks, some non-essential businesses will be allowed to open, it is believed. This includes garden centres and car showrooms, provided social distancing can be maintained. Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has guidelines on ensuring the safe reopening of non-essential firms. Suggestions include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. Contactless payments would be encouraged and self-checkout stations cleaned regularly. Staff who serve customers are to be protected with screens, visors and gloves. Other measures may include one-way systems through stores, a cap on how many people are allowed in at any given time and security guards at the door.

The two sides of the busy motorway, which links Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, separate just before the farm house comes into view, snaking around the property before merging together again a few miles further on. For decades, urban myths have surrounded the white washed building that makes up Stott Hall Farm and the fields around it. The motorway was built in the s and rumour has it that the farmer it belonged to, Ken Wild, had refused to sell it when plans for the six-lane carriage way were approved. It is believed that planners had to come up with way round the problem and decided to simply build the road round it. Ken had been living there with his we, Beth, and their flock of sheep. But rather than being a rebel who was taking a stand against a huge new motorway, it seems that Ken was nothing of the sort. A documentary, filmed almost  years after the motorway was completed, has revealed the truth about why the farm is in the middle of a motorway. Filmed in  and released a few years ago by the British Film Institute , Cleggaposs People explains why the road could never have been built on the farm. Journalist Michael Clegg explains: A geological fault beneath the farmhouse meant it was more practical for engineers to leave it rather than blast through and destroy it. Outside the noise is relentless but inside it’s as peaceful and cosy as any farmhouse. Ken and his we Beth had moved into the farmhouse in  and always insisted the motorway didnapost bother them. Although Beth did admit it made cleaning harder as the sheer number of cars speeding by meant it could get very dusty. Heartbreakingly though, the couple did witness a few fatal crashes while they were living on the farm. But the nearest they came to disaster was .am one morning when a ft lorry ended up overturned in their yard. Beth explained: “The driver climbed out through the windscreen. He wasn’t hurt at all. Eleven years ago, Jill Falkingham bought the house along with her husband Phil, and the couple moved in with their son, John-William.  They completely renovated the home, which dates back to , and Jill has always insisted itaposs no dferent to living anywhere .“Traffic is very close,” she told  the Manchester Evening News  . “But it’s always windy here, which takes the pollution away.

Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at the Office for National Statisticssaid: “People living in more deprived areas have experienced Covid- mortality rates more than double those living in less deprived areas. General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but so far Covid- appears to be taking them higher still.” In Wales, where levels of deprivation are measured dferently to England, the ONS found that the most deprived fth of areas had a Covid- mortality rate of . deaths per , population.  New research shows that Middlesbrough and Walsall have the highest rates of infection in the country - with Wolverhampton, Gateshead and St Helens also among the places where the disease has spread widely. Figures released by the Centre for Progressive Policy this week show that of the  places with the highest infection rates, just one - Luton - is in the south. Labour MP Conor McGinn, who represents St Helens in Merseyside, toldthat the areaaposs industrial past has contributed to high rates of respiratory diseases, as it has an older population. Mr McGinn said: Added to ten years of austerity that has seen huge funding cuts to the council and NHS, it is understandable that places like ours will be badly affected by coronavirus.  When the crisis subsides, there is an urgent need to address the huge health gap across the country, Middlesbroughaposs MP said. The figures show there are  cases per , of the population there, making it the most at-risk place for infections in England.

Itaposs a part of our daily routine weaposve been doing for as long as we can remember. But did you ever stop to think you might be doing it wrong  Well, according to a viral TikTok video, our everyday teeth cleaning method isnapost quite right. A man with great dental health shared the correct way to clean teeth with his we, who was so taken aback by it, she decided to share his top tips with people on social media - and even dentists agreed her partner was on to something. The woman, who posts on the TikTok account @KassySlays, explained how her husband had told her that the key is to start with an alcohol mouth wash, then to floss, then brush your teeth. She said: My husband has been keeping a secret from me, he says that the right way to brush your teeth is to first rinse with an alcohol mouthwash, then to floss, then to brush your teeth and then to use a fluoride rinse. He saysyou do the alcohol mouthwash last itaposll remove the fluoride that you just put on your teeth by brushing them, so you should do it first to kill the germs and then finish off with a whitening fluoride rinse.  She added: Apparently the last time he went to the dentist, the hygienist told him he didnapost even really need a cleaning. I was today years old and Iaposve got terrible teeth. A spokesperson for the British Dental Association confirmed that you should always use mouthwash before brushing your teeth - however they advised against finishing up with a fluoride rinse like in the video. They said: It’s essential to brush teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes – last thing at night and at one other time.  It’s important to clean all surfaces of the teeth and gently along the gum line. Interdental brushes are better for cleaning the spaces between teeth than floss, except where the space is too tight to insert a brush. Donapost rinse your mouth out after brushing, as it will wash away the fluoride which makes teeth more resistant to tooth decay -aposspit donapost rinseapos.  If you use mouthwash, use it at a dferent time to brushing, otherwise you’ll rinse away the protective effect of fluoride.

User @Marzpire shared a video asking: Ever wondered why you canapost drink out of a McFlurry spoon   She then makes a McFlurry with a big dollop of ice cream and sprinkles on the chosen topping, before putting on the lid and dropping the spoon in the centre.  Writing aposwhat the spoon is really forapos, she then slots it onto a machine using the square opening at the top, which spins the spoon to mix the delicious chocolate all the way down through the ice cream. Although many viewers said they thought the reason for the design was obvious, it came as news to others as one wrote: Wow! You just solved one of my entire le mysteries.

This evening, he revealed that restrictions will be lted on May  followed by a five stage process finishing on August . In the mean time, it is possible to travel up to km for the purpose of exercise. It is now possible for over s to drive or walk as long as they donapost come into contact with anyone . Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the last few weeks have transformed peopleaposs lives in so many dferent ways and ways that we could not have imagined. Speaking from Government Buildings in Dublin, he said: I know itaposs been dficult. The uncertainty about when things will get back to normal and the fear of the virus itself. As a nation, our physical health has been attacked, our mental health eroded. Our economy battered and our society put to the ultimate test. Many people are lonely during the pain of isolation. Many people are grieving in silence and many have lost their jobs. Mr Varadkar announced the easing of two restrictions - extending an exercise travel limit from km to km from home and advising over-s they can leave home for isolated exercise from Tuesday. Mr Varadkar added: Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is present.  So we could only move to the next stagethe virus stays under control between each phase and there is a risk that weaposd have to go back a phasethat happens. In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine, or an effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolatetheyaposre sick. It will take some time for our lives to get back to normal, to a new normal, but it will happen. So on the th of May, Ireland begins to reopen and begins that journey to a new normal. From that day outdoor work, like construction and landscaping, will resume.  Some retail outlets, like garden centres, hardware stores, repair shops will reopen and some outdoor sporting and fitness activities in small groups will be allowed. Mr Varadkar said that schools and colleges will reopen in September. Many regular health services will resume operating and it will be possible to meet small groups of friends and family outdoors, he added. Not long from now, some summer night, we will see our friends again. In later phases other workplaces, businesses, childcare, preschools, restaurants, cafes, bars, cinemas and gyms will reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September October at the start of the new academic year. Getting people back to work and restarting businesses will not be easy. It wonapost be possible for people just to pick up where they left off. Businesses are going to need help to get going again. So tomorrow morning Cabinet will meet again to agree further actions to help our businesses to restart, reconnect and rehire staff whoaposve been laid off or furloughed. Mr Varadkar added: Separately, a national protocol is being developed by Government, employers and trade unions with the assistance of the Health and Safety Authority of the HSE. This will enable a gradual restart of economic activity as restrictions are eased while protecting the health and safety of all workers as theyto work. We will do everything possible to get enterprises back and running so you can get your job back. While it will take some time before we get to enjoy again things we are missing, from the comfort of our families, to a night out with friends, those days will come again.

The health of the overweight North Korean dictator has been the subject of much speculation in recent days. Some sources in the communist country say that Kim has died while others report he is in a vegetative state following heart surgery. Kimaposs whereabouts have been unclear since presiding over an April  meeting. The dictator purportedly “had something wrong health-wise due to either excessive drinking or overwork,” a contributor for Seoul-based outlet Daily NK reported Friday. Although it admits “we do not know exactly,” the report adds, “He may have retired to his villa in Wonsan to rest.” Satellite images show a train parked at the leadership station in the coastal resort of Wonsan for more than a week - suggesting that Kim may be at his luxury compound - but North Korea watchers have cautioned that it could be a ersion tactic. Kim, whose absence has raised concerns about instability in the nuclear-armed nation, had initially planned to take a “short reprise” at his villa prior to heading to Pyongyang for the “Day of the Sun,” but skipped the planned event because he wasn’t feeling well, according to the report.  The report comes one day after Taiwan’s chief of intelligence said that Kim is “sick,” prompting his nation to create emergency contingency plans for a possible power strugglehe dies. Earlier today a North Korea defector who recently became a lawmaker in South Korea said he is  per cent sure Kim is dead.

The nurses can be seen carrying what appears to be a person playing dead in the footage posted on the social media . Some viewers suspected the stunt might have been based on the viral dancing Ghanaian pallbearers meme. Doctors and nurses around the world have been using social media to create light-hearted performances in hospitals to lt spirits during the pandemic. However not everyone has been impressed with the clip, which features the group wearing protective kit and carrying a body bag emblazoned with aposCovid-apos in red print. The internet has occasionally rounded on medics for spending time creating social media content in hospitals where patients are dying and families are blocked from seeing loved ones for fear of catching the virus. But even fellow medics said the latest clip featuring a fake bagged corpse had taken the hospital TikTok trend a step too far. Some suspected it could have been based on the aposGhana funeral dancerapos meme, which has become an unlikely macabre hit during the course of the pandemic. Footage of sharply-dressed Ghanaian pallbears performing skillful dance routines while they carry real coffins began doing the rounds in March, even as the pandemic gathered pace. Memes are often regurgitated on quick-fire video  TikTok, where they evolve into new viral trends. Some who criticised the nursesapos video said they understood it could be interpreted as aposgallows humourapos - referring to the dark brand of comedy used as a coping mechanism to help people work through tragedy.  But others branded the stunt as being in poor taste as the global coronavirus death toll nears , and tops , in the UK. It is unclear where the TikTok clip was filmed and the nurses are not identied in the post. However according to the Mail Online, the footage is believed to have been filmed at a hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Twitter user Brian Holan wrote that he had served in the military, and could appreciate gallows humor. However, they have to realize that the average person sees it dferently. If you are going to do this kind of humor fine, just keep it to yourselves, he wrote. Another Twitter user going by the name Lion Cub online claimed to have worked in emergency departments, and said they agreed with the criticisms. I agree with you %. Iaposve worked in ERs, inner city hospitals, and on crises teams. I know the value of gallows humor as self-preservation...but they shouldnapost have put it out there on social media.

The new findings suggest that rather than indicating reinfection, the positive results were due to testing failures. Researchers at the South Korean centre for Disease Control and Preventionnow said it is impossible for Covid- to reactivate in human bodies. Positive test results on people who had recovered from the virus were due to fragments of the virus remain in in their bodies, but with no power to make them ill again or to infect others. For live updates about coronavirus, follow our live blog.  Oh Myoung-don, the head of the committee, said the test carried out was unable to dferentiate between live strings of the virus and harmless traces that can remain in the body of someone who has recovered, The Times reports.The committee said in a statement: “RNA fragments still can exist in a cell eventhe virus is inactivated. “It is more likely that those who tested positive again picked up virus RNA that has already been inactivated.” It comes after thefound that seemingly “relapsed” patients were not infectious. Dr Oh said: “The respiratory epithelial cell has a half-le of up to three months, and RNA virus in the cell can be detected with PCR testing one to two months after the elimination of the cell. The researchers added that unlike other viruses, such as HIV and chickenpox - which can break into the nucleus of human cells and stay latent for years before reactivating - the coronavirus stays outside of the host cellaposs nucleus. This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence, explained Dr Oh Myoung-don. After hundreds of patients tested positive twice - in what South Korea now calls  positives -  the World Health Organisation warned governments against issuing immunity passports.

For me, the club was on its knees.“Not financially or anything like that but morale, the place was at rock bottom.“Everybody was trying to do everything to liven the place up and get us going and get it back to being a happy place for people to come to work.“I think now we are back in a situation where everybody feels part of it. At the minute it is a really good professional environment but there is more we can do to get better.”Despite taking caretaker charge of the final match of the previous season at home to St Mirren, McPake admits his first game as full-time boss at Raith Rovers, a - win in the Betfred Cup, was a big moment.“I was very nervous. It was my first real taste ofmy team – the St Mirren game wasn’t my team,” he said.“This was my first game, our new team’s first game and a lot of new ideas had went into that pre-season.“I was very nervous and probably only settled when the third goal went in.”The Dens boss would go on to miss a home stalemate with Peterhead a week later due to the birth of his daughter.Although it was tough to have to watch from afar, McPake knew he’d left the team in good hands with assistant Jimmy Nicholl and first-team coach Dave Mackay.“I watched the full game from the labour suite,” revealed McPake.“It wasn’t too dficult in the sense that I wasn’t there because, I’ll be honest, family is everything – whether it was a Dundee United game or anything, I was going to be at the birth of my child.“My worry was the baby would arrive when we were up at Coveand I would struggle to be there.“I watched the Peterhead game and I did try to get messages across to the staff, without being too intrusive.“We had picked the team before and for me to be texting from a labour ward and they are seeing the game in real time would’ve been wrong.“The messages I sent were very simple and we had Jimmy Nicholl # he’s played in two World Cups, managed a team that’s won our league and managed a team to a major trophy # and Dave Mackay had managed against teams in that league so we were in capable hands.“We just weren’t good enough on the day, simple as that, and were very flat. That gave us an early indication of what was to come – teams just came, let us have the ball and sit in.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united kids light up premiership gordon forrest","story":"Gordon Forrest has backed Dundee United’s young stars to shine in the Premiership.The Tangerines assistant boss has been hugely impressed with the quality of United’s academy prospects this season.Several have played their part in the Tannadice club’s Championship title-winning campaign.Louis Appere has been the headliner, with Scotland Under- recognition his reward for a stunning debut campaign.Others have made their presence felt in Robbie Neilson’s first team too.But Forrest expects United’s kids to move even further to the fore once United get started in the top flight.He said: “The owners have invested heavily in the academy and the focus will stay on bringing young players through.“We have a few who broke through last season, Louis Appere springs to mind # he had a very good season and got a Scotland U call up.“Declan Glass went out on loan in the first half of the season then played his part when he came back.“And Chris Mochrie too, he’s only sixteen but he got minutes and has a good future ahead of him.“There are others bubbling away in the background too, in that  or -year-old age group, that we think a lot of.“We certainly have a few players who will be there or thereabouts.”When United’s youngsters will get their chance to impress remains to be seen.With no decision yet made on how to conclude the current Premiership season, it’s a waiting game for the Tangerines.Players and staff alike have been placed on furlough leave, with only a few senior workers left in post to run the club through lockdown.It all adds up to a strange way to celebrate winning promotion after four years in the Championship.It’s mission accomplished for United, yet without the certainty of knowing when next season will begin, everything feels strangely unfinished.But as desperate as everyone at Tannadice is to know what’s going to happen next, Forrest insists safety is paramount for players, staff and fans ahead of anyto action.“You could see the way it was heading over the last few weeks,” said the United number two.“There were a lot of s and buts regarding the season starting again and we had a few plans in place depending on what happened.“But once we went on furlough that brings a lot to a halt and you’re looking at the media, the government and the health services.“I think that’s when we realised how distant things were getting – and that was before the vote took place.“We don’t look like we’ll be back training as a group any time soon and the talk now is about fans being able to come to games.“So it’s about the safety aspect now, that’s what’s going to be behind football starting up again.“All we can do is wait for the authorities to make a decision and then plan from there.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"george cran dundee fc email another stalemate","story":"I have a sneaking suspicion Scottish football is heading for another stalemate in the next couple of weeks over reconstruction.We’re all only just getting over the last one, induced by a combination of an over-active email spam folder, John Nelms doing his best Machiavellian impression and some shoddy governance.I have to admit, I’ve never envied the job Neil Doncaster has to do as chief executive of the SPFL – trying to corral  dferent voices into making a sensible decision while acting as a punchbag for all the critics to lay into the dys of our game.I’m not saying he’s blameless but his job does seem to me to consist of taking the blame for everything, whether he has anything to do with it or not.Now Ann Budge of Hearts and Les Gray of Hamilton seem to be enjoying that role as chairs of the reconstruction ‘task force’.Already dissenters are amassing and they’ve not even laid out what possible plans there might be to choose from.I’ve been very much in favour of league reconstruction for a long time now. In my ideal world we’d have at least a -team top flight. I’ve already given up hope of the Premiership clubs agreeing to another other than , however. Sorry, Dundee.My thinking is Nelms’ play over the vote saga was to force reconstruction into happening – I don’t think it’s going to benefit the Dark Blues in the immediate future, however.Next season they should be big favourites in the second tier, though. And a bigger top flight makes it easier to stay up the following season, too.Dundee United, on the other hand, can sit back safe in the knowledge they are a Premiership club no matter what – as long as it’s not a reduced ision, they’ll be happy.A stalemate, though, is brewing, I reckon.Already Budge and Gray have talked up dferent approaches – Hearts want a temporary change while Accies want permanent.Temporary seems pretty pointless to me – that only benefits a handful of clubs, one of them being Hearts. The rest will no doubt shout that down.Now, though, the League Two teams are ganging up on the rest.I have to admire the bolshiness of that, to be honest.They want a -- set-up or nothing. I quite like that idea.Bigger leagues make things more interesting and improve our football.Already, though, clubs higher up the food chain are taking potshots at them.I can’t help but think these are only opening salvos in another departure from sanity from Scottish football.Dundee United are talking of aiming high – that’s exactly what they should be doing.Managing director Mal Brannigan says the club should be targeting the top six and, beyond that,Normally I’d think the manager of a newly-promoted club whose top director had mentioned Europe and trophies would be thinking: #Thanks very much for making my job harder.#However, Robbie Neilson has the same targets at Tannadice and spoke about European football months ago.I like a club to be ambitious and United have enough about them as a club to be a top-six power again.That’s where they were when I moved to Dundee and it didn’t seem like they were punching above their weight.Right now, though, they are far from that level.Fans will like the big talk and they should definitely be allowed to dream.Backing up those words is the hard part, though. I sincerely hope the top dogs at United can do just that –they do, it’ll be some ride at Tannadice.ARSENAL have begun training again and the English Premier League have launched ‘Project Restart’.With England – and particularly London – hit worse by the coronavirus than we are up here, I find it strange to see clubs and leagues ing back into things so quickly.I desperately want to see football back as soon as possible but there needs to be awareness that it looks like one rule for rich footballers and another for the rest of us.FIFA are talking about allowing five subs per team to ease congestion when the game kicks off again. Fair enough but I don’t want to see that as the norm going forward. We’ll be using rolling subs before we know it."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53603633-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"the feelgood feed stories to lift your day","story":"Things are tough right now — but the power of community has never been more important or more obvious.In every walk of le, people are coming together to ensure that no one is left to fight coronavirus alone.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer.

I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in.

Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

ldquoBickers Well in Musselburgh.I hadnrsquot heard of this before so I looked into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/11077867.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Maybe longer.Such a blanket policy surely has ageism at its core, regardless of how well-intentioned. How  do you explain the assumption that everyone over the age of  is weak and incapable of making decisions about their own health and wellbeing The evidence from UK Covid- wards suggests the average age of a critically ill patient is .

We also know, of course, this cruel illness can afflict, sometimes kill, young and fit people.Until a vaccine is widely available ndash an endeavour scientists believe may take  months or more ndash many people with underlying health conditions of every age group will obviously want to take maximum care and precautions to prevent exposing themselves to danger. They accept, hard as it may be, that they wonrsquot be able to leave home. Others wonrsquot have the mental capacity to make these decisions for themselves.But what about over-s that are fitter, healthier and more active than their younger relatives and friends  And what about older people who do suffer from underlying health problems but would rather take a dferent approach once restrictions start to be lted They may decide it is worth leaving home, spending time with grandchildren and friends, going shopping, evenit means an increased chance of catching the virus. They may be willing to accept the associated risks and consequences.Whatrsquos so galling is the idea that no-one over  can or should decide for themselves what risks they are willing to take with their own health and wellbeing.One of most interesting aspects of this crisis has been the way it has forced all of us to examine and question what makes le worth living. Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules.

The spirit of kindness this pandemic has stirred is humbling. Wersquove always liked to think of ourselves as a caring nation ndash not always with reason ndash but seeing the range of ways in which theory is being put into practice is eye-opening. This will have far-reaching consequences, some of which, I suspect, will reverberate long after lockdown. Not the least of these is discovering how many are eager to be pressed into service, and what they can achieve when marshalled.None of us knows how long more vulnerable members of society will be asked to stay home. What is increasingly clear, though, is that while the sort of helpful domestic support going on now will be finite ndash even , for some, the necessity of relying on others makes it feel never-ending ndash informal community involvement on several fronts will continue to be important, and perhaps even essential, in the coming years.Long before the present situation, a crack squad of citizen gardeners had taken it upon themselves to turn our nearest town into an outpost of Kew gardens. Others put up Christmas decorations, or tend the tubs and raised beds at the train station, keeping plants on the concourse thriving across the seasons. There are iniduals, meanwhile, who go out in all weathers with litter pickers and refuse bags. They clear the verges and river banks of crisp-packets, plastic bottles, cans, takeaway cartons and all the detritus ditched by those who shouldknow better. Thanks to them, wildle and livestock are safer, burns cleaner, the undergrowth no longer unsightly and depressing.Irsquove always been intrigued by those who donrsquot feel their patch ends where their property meets the pavement. For such folk, the mental map of where their obligation or responsibility lies stretches far beyond the obvious bounds of self-interest. Most of us like to keep our own house in order, but those who are outward-looking are protective of a much wider area. The same goes for helping others. For some, the family circle is as far as their antennae reach. Others respond to those in need whom theyrsquove never met, or ndash through charitable giving especially ndash whose names theyrsquoll never know.Who can say what state the economy will be in when this virus goes into retreat, nor how long it will take to recover. None of the predictions makes cheerful reading, so it seems reasonable to assume that, for a period at least, there will not be an abundance of cash in council coffers. They were hardly overflowing a year ago but with the likelihood of a serious fiscal downturn, shoestring budgets will grow even more threadbare.Around these parts, people are stepping up, not just to collect refuse or plant bulbs by the roadside, but to mow communal areas of grass, strim embankments and de-litter waterways and bridlepaths. You could say that most of this is the councilrsquos responsibility, and yoursquod be right. At a certain point, however, it becomes a pernicious and self-defeating outlook always to expect others to get things done when you could simply get up and do it yourself.So, while this is not intended to suggest letting local government off the hook, whenever essential services come under threat ndash rural buses and post offices, libraries, care packages ndash those of us with time, imagination and inclination can surely help plug the gap, evenonly in the short-term.Thanks to the current volunteer force, I foresee a future when, with the memory of Covid  fading, initiatives intended to get us through this emergency will live on and help communities flourish.

Only last week the UK Government delivered a further pound million for Scottish local government. This is money that should be urgently handed over to our struggling councils.These lelines come in addition to the billions of pounds being given by the UK Government to Scottish workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs or incomes as a result of the Covid- economic shakedown. Other support includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, the deferment of VAT and income tax payments, and a statutory sick pay relief package.Additionally, the British Army has been drafted in to assist with the response and relief effort.This unprecedented intervention was only achievable because it rests on the strong shoulders of the Union. The reality is that an independent Scotland would have buckled and collapsed had it faced the Covid- crisis alone. With tough times ahead, it would therefore be catastrophic economically for Scotland to go it alone by cutting itself adrt from the UK, which is the sixth-largest economy in the world.Even before the current Covid- crisis, the -page Growth Commission, led by economist and former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, predicted, in , that independence would cause years of austerity for Scotland.While therefore the SNP remain entitled to make an emotional case for independence, even its most diehard supporters must now concede that they have lost the economic argument.The Covid- crisis reinforces the point that independence remains an SNP pipedream which Scotland simply cannot afford.Tim Jackson, Gullane.HOW very sad that we are in a position where the UK cannot speak as one during the coronavirus crisis and factions have opened up ndash all leading to confusion and exacerbating our already-fractured society.We should have one source of advice from the Sovereign Government and forget about petty political point-scoring.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.HOW sad to see the pandemic stats from other countries similar to our own and realise that their death toll is a fraction of what we have here.If only we had been a bit braver at the referendum, how many lives could have been saved.Robert Drummond, Glasgow G.IT is disappointing that a politician of the stature of former Labour MP for Maryhill, Maria Fyfe, should seize upon the distortion by some sections of the press, who took out of context Nicola Sturgeons reply to a question about whether she would consider closing the border between Scotland and England Ms Sturgeon replied \"I dont have the power to close borders, but these are discussions of course we want to continue to have with the UK government\", referring to the UKs international borders .It is understandable that Ms Fyfe and Labour in Scotland should feel sore at the SNP Ms Fyfes former seat is now represented by an SNP MP, as indeed is every constituency in Glasgow, and Labour holds but one seat in Scotland however it only has itself to blame for the mortying mess in which it finds itself.

There has been an increase, in some parts of the country, in road traffic by as much as  per cent. Last weekend in my local park, the sun out and the sky an enamel blue, it was like any summer weekend of picknickers, sunbathers and folk passing on paths shoulder to shoulder.Nicola Sturgeon, in yesterdays daily briefing, put the increase in vehicle journeys down to a straining against lockdown conditions. \"You might feel you deserve it,\" she said, \"After weeks of restraint. Believe me, I really understand all of that.\"Were at around six weeks now and people are missing people, people are missing the things they previously took for granted. They have kept up with social distancing and washed their hands until the skin began to chafe. Tempers are also chafing.Some are in strict adherence to the guidance. Others have let their guard down as times gone on. These two groups dont make for a good mix.And so to face masks. The First Minister this week made the suggestion that citizens might like to cover their mouth and nose when they go to places where a higher volume of people make social distancing dficult, for example at the supermarket or local shops, or on public transport.Just a recommendation, nothing compulsory. That could have been that, but no.The advice until now has been that masks make very little dference and are not recommended. Jason Leitch, the governments National Clinical Director, only at the beginning of April was very clear that wearing masks was not the right way forward.But, as Professor Leitch pointed out, we are in a rapidly changing situation and advice, too, will rapidly change. The issue was not helped by Professor Hugh Pennington appearing on radio and television to say that face coverings are \"very poor\" and offer \"little protection\".Waters were further muddied by constitutional grumbles, at Holyrood splitting in a dferent direction to Westminster. ITVs political reporter was given short shrt when asking Ms Sturgeonthe conflicting advice north and south of the border would be confusing.\"Are you reporting on confusion,\" she lobbed at Peter MacMahon, \"Or are you actually helping to cause confusion \"The wearing of face coverings is a seemingly straightforward piece of advice and not compulsory, so you can sympathise with frustrations over what turned into a protracted discussion.At the same time, the public is being asked to absorb an entirely new lexicon and, for those of us with no science background at all, weigh up entirely new information and come to a choice that, were told, could save lives. Or increase the death rate.There is clearly a moral pressure there for iniduals to do the right thing by making the right choice - and a societal pressure. It was mere weeks ago that we started talking about social distancing and now it has become part of the language asit had always been common parlance.Now were reading about aerosol transmission, hearing about small scale studies into face coverings, being given conflicting advice from prominent scientists then being told we shouldnt feel confused.There are countless suggestions for how best to wear a face covering. how to make them, the best materials to use, how to wear them and how to safely dispose of them. Its a lot of information to process.At the supermarket on Wednesday, I saw no one wearing homespun face coverings and three people wearing medical-style masks. Its obviously a small sample size but the message didnt seem to have immediately prompted action.However, the response I saw online to the suggestion of face coverings was that,its possible they might make some small positive change, people should wear them.Its not the time for widespread public debates about conflicting studies and is the time for unity and collective action. If there is small gain and no loss, then its dficult to argue against getting on board.However, that takes us back to fraying tempers. Bruce Adamson, the children and young peoplersquos commissioner for Scotland, along with a coalition of charities, has written to supermarkets to ask that parents with children are not turned away or shamed by staff when they go for groceries. Increasing numbers of parents are reporting being told to leave their children in the car or being verbally abused by other shoppers.This shows no empathy or understanding for single parents. Or, of course, couples where one is ill, a key worker, or caring for a disabled child at home, and etc.Face coverings risk becoming another cause for friction in public places. Some people will weigh up the pros and cons and choose not to. But not everyone will be able to wear masks - people with autism may struggle, those who are claustrophobic, people with asthma.For deaf people, other people wearing masks makes communication more dficult or even impossible. It can be exhausting for lip readers, for example, to be on high alert constantly to what happening around them.There needs to be an element of trust to our public interactions. We may feel we are doing a better job then those around us of sticking to the rules but there are many invisible barriers that force other people to make choices we may view as wrong.Perhaps instead of rushing to berate someone who skips a queue or walks in your path, consider they might not know youre there. Before shouting at a mother and child in the supermarket, imagine she might prefer her child to be almost anywhere  than in a public place in a pandemic.Were being asked to make personal decisions with the collective good in mind.

Amor estimates the crater resulting from the impact spans almost nine miles in , with a depth of around . miles ndash making it the biggest ever astral collision ever discovered in the UK.Experts believe meteorite strikes were relatively common billions of years ago, as Earth and other planets were pelted with debris left over from the formation of the solar system.Amor says the new research marks such an exciting discovery because impact craters typically erode over time.ldquoIt was purely by chance that this one landed in an ancient rt valley where fresh sediment quickly covered the debris to preserve it, he states.Now that the craterrsquos possible location has been discovered, scientists aim to conduct targeted, D geophysical surveys of the Minch Basin.High-resolution surveys could help the research team get a better sense of the dimensions of the crater - and might even have important implications for other celestial bodieswe learn more about their composition and trajectory.ldquoImpact craters on Earth are exceedingly rare, Amor said. ldquoThe better we can understand how they formed the better we can understand observations on the rocky planets and moons of the solar system.--------------------------------------------------Space enthusiasts get ready to rockGlasgow academics call for volunteers to help collect meteorites as part of UK Fireball NetworkSCOTTISH scientists are turning their eyes to the skies to track meteorites ndash smaller, less threatening iations of their asteroid cousins - before they land on UK soil and want volunteers to help recover the space rocks wherever they fall.The UK Fireball Network, led by researchers from the University of Glasgow and Imperial College London is setting out to place  cameras across the country to catch glimpses of the spectacular natural firework displays caused when meteoroids enter the Earthrsquos atmosphere.It is part of a wider network called the Global Fireball Observatory operated by researchers in Australia at Curtin University.Earlier this year in February, the networkrsquos cameras filmed their first fireball, which dropped meteorites into the North Sea.SKYFALL:Volunteers will help scientists search for traces of meteorites which have been tracked on camera.While those are impossible to recover, the network team expect that future sightings that fall on the UK landmass can be properly triangulated to determine a landing area and send out a search party to find future meteorites.Dr Luke Daly, of the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, is one of the leaders of the UK Fireball Network. He said: ldquoMeteorites provide scientists with invaluable insights into other planets and our solar system. A good deal of what we know about the surface of Mars, for example, comes from analysis of chunks of the planet which were blasted off its surface by asteroid impacts millions of years ago and drted in space before falling to Earth.ldquoMeteorites enter our atmosphere all the time, but the UK hasnrsquot had a great track record of finding them ndash in fact, itrsquos been nearly  years since one was last seen dropping into a back garden in Glatton in Cambridgeshire, and more than  since one was observed in Scotland.ldquoCamera networks like ours, and those of partner organisations like UKMON and SCAMP, give us a great chance to capture fireballs on multiple cameras.ldquoTogether we are building an integrated pipeline to use all the data from all the networks to track fireballs called the UK Fireball Alliance.ldquoIt was very exciting to capture our first images of a fireball caught by two of our observatories, although it was obviously disappointing that the material it dropped fell into the sea.ldquoWhen we do catch sight of a fireball dropping meteorites on land, wersquoll need the help of volunteers to help comb the countryside to find them, so anyone interested in making a little bit of history by getting involved can follow us on Twitter at @FireballsUK."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-zoo-launches-lion-webcam-thank-supporters","story":"The webcam gives viewers the chance to see the wildle conservation charityrsquos eight-month-old Asiatic lion cubs from home.The lsquolion camrsquo will also help to raise awareness of the threats faced by this endangered species in the wild - which population estimates for the Asiatic lions range from merely  -  iniduals.:Coronavirus: Boris Johnson promises lsquocomprehensive planrsquo on easing lockdownAfter closing its doors to visitors in March, the zoo is relying on the support of animal lovers to raise enough money to pay its pound, monthly food bill.Alison Maclean, animal team leader at Edinburgh Zoo said: ldquoWe are so grateful for the support wersquove had so far and wanted to do something to thank everyone for raising enough money to feed our animals in April.\"Almost all of our income comes from our visitors and our food bill alone is pound, every month so it is a challenging time for our charity.

We need a fully resourced testing, isolation and tracing programme and ministers should be using this lockdown time to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats said: \"The Health Secretarys arbitrary target of , tests by the end of April was always a hostage to fortune, and the truth is, he missed it.ldquoItrsquos extremely disappointing the Government have decided to massage the metrics rather than admit they fell short, as this will only undermine public confidence.He went on: \"Everyone wants the country to succeed in beating this awful disease but the British public wonrsquot be so easily fooled by manipulation.ldquoIts deeply regrettable but were still miles off the large-scale testing programme that will be an essential part of any plan to ease out of lockdown through a test, trace and isolate approach.The London MP added: \"Liberal Democrats have long-called for the Government to be frank about what is and is not achievable, to ensure transparency and maintain public trust but ministers continue to play fast and loose with the truth.\"The row came as the latest UK figures showed , people had now died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus, up by  on the day before.The death toll rose as:*the PM is not expected to announce any changes to the lockdown measures before next Thursday, the deadline to renew restrictions*Ryanair said up to , jobs could be lost at the airline while unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to % were also proposed*the head of the Royal College of GPs said half of consultations with patients could move online while urgent cancer referrals had seen a % drop and*Suggestions were made that the Isle of Wight would become the first test and contact tracing pilot area next week with speculation the Scottish islands could follow later in the monthAt the No  press conference, Mr Hancock said the next phase of dealing with Covid- - which will include more community testing and contact tracing - would allow the Government \"to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all\".He explained: \"In recent weeks weve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones and yet our goal must be freedom. Freedom from the virus, yes, and we will not lt measures until it is safe to do so.ldquoBut also, we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too - each citizens right to do as they please.\"However, the Health Secretary said that, for now, people must stay at home while the number of cases of coronavirus was driven down further.He pointed out that , contact tracers to track those who had come into contact with an infected person would be in place by mid-May and the numbers would be increasednecessary.Professor Stephen Powis, NHS Englandrsquos Medical Director, said officials would be studying whether stricter measures would or would not have to continue to apply to the elderly when the lockdown was eased.\"The over-s can be absolutely fit and healthy, its not the case that everybody over  has a chronic health condition or underlying disease,\" he said.\"As we look forward...its a perfectly reasonable question to say how would that work in age groups and age bands \"Although we do know that complications and unfortunately deaths are more common in the elderly even without complications, I think thats for consideration and thats work that we will need to do as we move forward,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"david-icke-says-nicola-sturgeon-moronic-grasp-truth-covid-19","story":"Earlier today, the former TV presenter and ex-professional footballer was banned from Facebook for \"repeatedly violatingpolicies on harmful misinformation\".Icke has alleged G is linked to the Covid- outbreak and also suggested the pandemic was engineered to help install a fascist world government.In a video released today, Icke said coronavirus tests were a scam.\"Nicola Sturgeon will not have the brainpower torealize that theyre not even testing for Covid-,\" he added.\"Ive been saying this for weeks and weeks.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property.

Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels.

Yes. But let#s see Alastair also advocate thoroughly for zero hours workers, for parents living in temporary accommodation, for children who are feed from food banks, for people who are now, and who will shortly be living beyond their means,and for the increasing number of people who cannot meet their basic needs. A Universal Basic Income is fundamentally a liberal idea, in as much as people have entitlemment to be spared unreasonable harm. Sowe were to use existing systems to support iniduals, in a responsive and responsible way, possibly at a lower cost than the support now being offered for businesses, we would secure immediate economic stimulus, prevent unreasonable hardship, rebalance the playing field and limit damage to future generations. A heap of thinking has gone into the idea of what rights we each ought to enjoy, the things we should freely have, like affordable transport, and the things we should have the freedom to escape, like hunger. Now is a useful time to be considering such issues, the better for all.An interesting idea, Peter, and one which it may surprise you to learn was looked atseveral years ago by WIr Shetland as a possible policy option for Shetland autonomy.At the time, no country in the world had adopted it however FInland was planning to run a pilot project which it was decided to monitor. I am no longer involved and cannot comment on the current WS situation or policy.After a short, two year trial, the Finnish government decided to end the scheme last year and was reportedly considering alternatives such as a universal credit scheme, similar to that of the UK .Pleased that our MP was pressing the Chancellor on this within  minutes!Always good to see fellow Liberals backing liberal ideas.It is going to be really important to sustain a discussion on the basic rights and freedoms everyone should be able to access now. People should be free from depending on food banks. People should be able to travel freely to access skills training and broad educational opportunities.The UBI can help stop people falling through the cracks, but other ideas are neededall are to be able to live fulfilling lives of their choosing.This is because the cost of being to be able to exercise basic freedoms ies both across the country and from household to household as people#s inidual circumstances so dfer.The Universal Basic Income would help to kick start the economy and would do do fairly, , as Alistair, suggested, the tax system was used to claw the cash back from those who did not need it. Of course that would involve taxing the rich.Little wonder that the Chancellor dismissed the idea out of hand.Permanent State Fund Dividend of Alaska, the same idea. Not bad for a Trump-voting Republican state. Somewhat predates the liberal idea.

There was quite a long waiting time for more to come in.”It was then that high-ranking officials at NHS Shetland said ‘let’s get a pattern and get sewing scrubs.’Ms Gray said things quickly went “beyond our wildest dreams” after that.“At the moment we have a fully stocked hospital.”But there’s still no time to lose. Already new scrubs have been developed for five care homes across the isles, and the hospital in Aberdeen has also asked for assistance.“We will help ARI once we’ve stocked the care homes,” said Ms Gray. #We’ve currently stocked five care homes and have three more to do. That five includes the Walter and Joan Gray.#She added: “When we got the patterns we only had access to domestic printers.“We just used the printer here. People would come and pick them up, take them home and stick  pages together to make a full-size pattern. You get your cloth on top of a pattern and cut round it, but because we could only print off on A, we needed  pages.”Meanwhile, NHS Shetland is still on the lookout for donations of finished scrubs.It has put out green bins for donations at Montfield in Lerwick, as well as health centres in Brae, Levenwick and Bixter.Volunteer Carole Flaws uses a Shetland Times-printed pattern to cut material into shape.Shetland Times chief executive Colin Grant said: #I contacted the NHS at the start of the pandemic to offer our assistance and machinery capabilities free of charge, so it#s been uplting for our team to get involved and do our peerie bit.#We are delighted to have helped out the NHS by printing these scrubs patterns for them.#He said he hoped the colourful end products would raise the spirits of key workers and patients, as well as offer the required protection. raquo.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chaffinch-e1588106230608.jpg","title":"nature notes the high cost of a quiet","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe coronavirus pandemic has made us realise how vulnerable we all are.As well as the direct threat to our physical health there is the more insidious effect on our mental health.It’s dficult enough communicating when we are being asked to keep two metres apart, but how will relationships farewe are obliged to cover our mouth and nose with a mask What price the loss of a smile “Don’t go out keep a distance from your neighbour don’t forget to wash your hands after you have touched a surface that someone  might have touched”.We are all potential sufferers of agoraphobia, obsessive compulsive disorder and general anxiety.For all our belief in rationality, our mental state is fragile and can easily be knocked off balance.It brings to mind a problem I once had with a chaffinch – pathetic I know, but yes, a chaffinch!At the time I was spending most of my time writing and researching a topic that required prolonged concentration.And then along came the chaffinch.I tried wax earplugs. I tried keeping them in all day but I ended up with an ear infection.I tried noise-reduction headphones – very expensive – but anything to keep out that incessant -decibel shrieking.I even tried wearing them whilst gardening and playing an early Queen album at full volume: “Sheer Heart Attack” – that should drown it out,it doesn’t give me one …What next I was so sensitive, or to give it its psychological name – “sensitised” – that I could even pick out the faintest suggestion of a chaffinch on a TV programme.It might be while watching the golf or some Jane Austen adaptation with a scene near some trees – and that blooming chaffinch was there in the background. Why doesn’t anybody  notice it What next  What next to do  Chop all the trees down around the house, down to ground level – that’s what next to do.And so I take an axe and like a deranged lumberjack, I fell every Sitka spruce within earshot.I cut down the white fuchsia to within feet of the ground, and the sessile oak and the sycamores and the rowan and the Swedish whitebeam – the lot, all down to within a few feet of the ground.That should do it. Just tell everyone it’s to give the deciduous trees more space, and the coppicing of what’s left will make them grow all the stronger.And then, next spring – all potential perching sites cleared from near the house….but the traffic!You open the door and there is a car stopped, looking at us and we look out of the window and there is a car stopped looking back at us….What a state to be in!Quick – replant some mature trees to provide an instant screen. The Christmas trees from past years with root balls still intact – they should do it and that escallonia and the New Zealand holly – evergreens to block the view of the road.This is madness. One month I am cutting down all the trees the next month I’m desperate to put them back!There is humour here.Someone calls when the trees have disappeared only to find that when next they visit, just months later, the trees are back again – some fully grown.Complete amazement: “Things don’t half grow fast here!”Thankfully, it’s an episode from the distant past.Time is a great healer I gradually managed to rewire my brain circuits and become habituated to the noise of the chaffinch.I can laugh at it now, but it shows how fragile and vulnerable the human mind can be.And so to the news that’s on everyone’s mind – coronavirus.As someone over , I am trying to minimise the risk of catching it and passing it on. Self-isolating is a daunting prospect and who knows how long this lockdown will last and what the future will bring I am reminded of that classic story from : “The Monkey’s Paw” by WW Jacobs. “Without, the night was cold and wet … ‘Hark at the wind … Path’s a bog and the road’s a torrent.”Gosh! This is far too close to home.The tale has been adapted many times for radio, television, film and theatre, and the full short-story text is available on the Internet.In the present circumstances it would be in poor taste to dwell on the details.Suffice it to say, the message is a salutary one, beginning with the anonymous quote: “Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.”As I sit here in this eerie quietness – no more tourist traffic rumbling by and stopping outside our gateway – I cannot escape the jarring irony.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ben-ak-wind-farm.jpg","title":"renewables firm launches support fund for north west skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHouseholds in North West Skye will be able to access grants of up to £ to help them through the coronavirus crisis thanks to a new major pledge from a renewable energy firm.has announced a fund for the communities around its windfarms to help alleviate the impact of the Covid- outbreak.The company is donating £, to be shared between the community benefit trusts which administer funds from its  wind farms in Scotland, England and Wales.Jason Bold, Chair of Dunvegan Community Trust who administer the funding from Ben Aketil Wind Farm, said: “Whilst we navigate these challenging circumstances in our rural community, Falck Renewables Covid- grant has offered us much needed funds to collaborate with local groups.#Dunvegan Community Council has been very responsive and progressive to set up a Community Fund, which we are proud to back with Falck’s kind support.”The Trust has joined forces with Dunvegan and District Community Council to establish a community fund offering financial support to anyone in the community council area experiencing financial hardship due to the Covid  virus.Grants will be generally given to support immediate needs and be limited to £ per household.The community fund will be facilitated and regulated by Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.John Laing, chair of Dunvegan and District Community Council, said: “The Dunvegan Community Council are aware of the dficulties many iniduals and families are experiencing during these exceptional times.#We have launched the Dunvegan Community Fund to assist those in our community who are in need of assistance as a result of the Covid  virus and are delighted to have generous support of The Dunvegan Trust and Falck Renewables whose generous support have made our fund possible”Managing Director of Falck Renewables UK, Richard Dibley, said: “We have a close relationship with the communities around our wind farms and their response to the current challenging situation has been as proactive and heartwarming as we would have expected.#They are already involved in helping the people and organisations in their area who need it most and we were keen to support them.”Dunvegan Community Trust has also made a £, donation to the Skye and Lochalsh Community Food Bank.Food bank chair Davina McCluskie said: “We are very grateful for the grant from the Dunvegan Community Trust which will go a long way in helping those in need.  We have seen an increase in users at the foodbank and I fear we will see many more in the coming weeks.#We have no paid members on the food bank committee #

And that’s actually the better thing to do.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHe referenced a report by Ulster University captured at the height of the pandemic using thermal imaging cameras in offices, which showed that many people are still not washing their hands.Dr Ackerley said: “There have been some research papers that indicate coronavirus can be shed in faeces so it’s even more important that people wash their hands after going to the toilet as well as all the other key times.She said there needed to be a change in public attitudes when lockdown measures eased in the future.“One of the things we need to change in our opinions is that it’s not just about protecting ourselves from other people but it’s about protecting other people from ourselves.”With food packing, the risk is low but there are steps you can take to put your mind at ease, she said.“It could be contaminated but the contamination isn’t necessarily going to be in the food factory or even in the shop or from the people running the shop. “But a lot of people are going to be touching the packaging in the course of the day when the food is on sale.“If the food is something that has got a long shelf le - like a tin or a bottle of squash - you could just leave it for three days by which time we know that the amount of viable virus will have reduced substantially.“If you have milk or something perishable that needs to go in the fridge or freezer and it concerns you, it isn’t that much effort to disinfect the outside surface of the food packaging.“The most important thing is to go straight to the wash basin and wash your hands for  seconds and that really does help to remove any virus you might have picked up. That’s good common sense practice anyway,” she said.You can hear more on the Belfast ’s Coronavirus podcast on Soundcloud and Spoty.Belfast Related ContentGalleryCoronavirusCoronavirus: As shoppers buy rugs, deck chairs and fake flowers, we ask - what happened to essential items only Ever so slowly they came trundling out of the store, their trolleys so heavily laden that the contents started spilling out.,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It followed Stormont Minister Edwin Poots# suggestion that churches, garden centres and forest parks should be allowed to open while maintaining social distancing.Some Church leaders expressed concern about rushing to ease restrictions while others believe it could be done slowly and safely.Rev Steve Stockman from Fitzroy Presbyterian Church in south Belfast said he understands that people have hit a wall after six weeks of lockdown and are becoming frustrated at having to stay at home.While he knows people want to go and worship, Rev Stockman believes the key message now is to love your neighbour by being sensible and staying in to protect the elderly and NHS staff.This is a time when we have to sacrice those rights that we would like in order to keep our neighbours alive by being patient, he said.In our own church we would have to consider holding a couple of Sunday services to ensure social distancing can be met, with people having to leave quickly afterwards with none of the normal socialising being possible Rev Steve StockmanCurrently there is a lot of good worship going on online that means people can be together.While it#s not ideal, many churches seem to be well enough equipped that they don#t need to be rushing back to normal and I have a slight fear about how we would make this a reality.In our own church we would have to consider holding a couple of Sunday services to ensure social distancing can be met, with people having to leave quickly afterwards with none of the normal socialising being possible.However Pastor Mark McClurg, of Newtownards Elim Church, said consideration should be given for the controlled opening of church buildings, particularly in terms of people#s mental wellbeing.Pastor McClurg - who spent several days in the intensive care unit at the Ulster Hospital battling coronavirus and is now recovering at home - said: I feel that we need to have this conversation and I#m not asking for this to happen immediately but for us to think about what markers need to be put in place.I#m hearing from people who are feeling anxious, lonely and fearful for the future and it#s clear that the current situation is affecting their mental health.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePastor Mark McClurg FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPastor Mark McClurgAt the same time we don#t want to open up too early and while it has been great to see that happening in New Zealand, you have to balance it with what happened in Germany where there has been a recurrence of Covid- cases, he added.I am very conscious that some members of my congregation have been in self-isolation since early March and I don#t really see why they can#t come to the church for solitary prayer Fr Michael CannyFr Michael Canny, a Catholic priest in the Waterside area of Londonderry, believes churches could reopen for solitary prayer only rather than full worship.At this point in time I am not advocating that we should have all churches open for all of the many rituals we normally have, such as the Eucharist.

Now, Finnebrogue hosts a series of social and cultural events throughout the year, boosting funds for charity and keeping the estate at the heart of the community. I asked Noel, chairman of the Hope for Youth charity, how Covid- has impacted le at Finnebrogue.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNoel Lamb in the library at Finnebrogue House FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNoel Lamb in the library at Finnebrogue HouseUnfortunately, the current lockdown has caused several cancellations, he says.We have a iety of events here at Finnebrogue, but one of the most successful is where I offer to host a dinner in the main dining room as an auction lot. One of the guests at the auction, either an inidual or a corporate, makes a bid, with the highest winning the auction lot.On the whole, I#ve no doubt that the situation will have an impact on all historic homes. Those depending on revenue from tours, events and gardens will suffer this year Noel LambThe most disappointing cancellation so far is a charity dinner due in May. Originally, this had been bid for at the Hope for Youth lunch at the Culloden Hotel with Roddy Doyle. It is a black tie event and the saloon, library and dining room would all have been used during the evening. Hopefully we can rearrange it for a later date, depending on social distancing guidelines.Last November, Hope for Youth also bid for a charity dinner at the House of Lords versus House of Commons swim. It was due to take place in November but I think we#ll have to make a decision in July. On the whole, I#ve no doubt that the situation will have an impact on all historic homes. Those depending on revenue from tours, events and gardens will suffer this year. As for Finnebrogue, most of the events are charity-related, so the charities will struggle as donations dry up.Whatever the changes at Finnebrogue, coronavirus has given Noel a new perspective on le.I was in London in mid-March when I suffered a sharp abdominal pain, he tells me. It took four trips to AE before a CT scan revealed a kidney stone. I was admitted to hospital for two days and during that time they tested me for coronavirus. I had none of the listed symptoms, so when it came back positive it was a bit of a shock.For two of those days in hospital I was placed in a Covid- ward where most people were on ventilators and suffering other ailments. I was unlucky to get ill but very fortunate not to have symptoms of the virus. I#ve been feeling fine ever since, but I came out of it with a rather dferent perspective. Now, I just enjoy every day, spending time in spring sunshine, appreciating the beautul gardens.Covid-#s greatest sting is the lack of contact between friends and family.Yes, I am missing the social interaction from friends and family, Noel says. I find not seeing people during the day very strange but fortunately there#s WhatsApp calls and other means of communication. Now, whenever I think of friends far away or those I haven#t seen in a while, I make a point of calling them. So far I have resisted Zoom! But when we get back to normality we#ll appreciate meeting people all the more.What is he looking forward to most when le s to normal I think, at the end of the day, there will have to be re-evaluations. We#ll all get a clearer image of what is really important and have more awareness of others. I#m looking forward to brighter days. Just sitting with friends, around the kitchen table, enjoying a salad or a bowl of pasta - such joy!‘We have so much sympathy for those couples who have had to postpone their wedding plans, but we have found everyone so cooperative’Coronavirus has brought an unprecedented challenge to Richard and Rosalind Mulholland of Ballyscullion Park, an estate which sits on the shores of Lough Beg in Co Londonderry, but it#s not the first the couple have faced.In , Ballyscullion was operating as a dairy farm until TB was detected among the herd and the couple were forced to start again. Making the most of their historic legacy - the Park dates back to  while the house was built in  - they ventured down the hospitality and tourism route, becoming one of Northern Ireland#s top event and wedding destinations.Now, even in light of the pandemic, Rosalind remains upbeat.We#re so fortunate to have the gardens, she says. They keep us busy and give us plenty to do. We took the opportunity of having no weddings to do some repairs on the lawns - levelling and reseeding - but it needs the rain to get it growing again! It#s lovely having three of our children at home and although Cordelia is in lockdown in Italy where she lives with her husband, rugby player Ian McKinley, we keep in touch via the internet.The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding. We hope that will work in our favour as lockdown eases Rosalind MulhollandOur daughter Oliviais here, also working from home. She is project managing for University College London Hospital Trust, having regular meetings with her team in London. Her husband Kieran is also working from here although at the moment he#s quarantined in one of our cottages because he was in London till last Friday. Our youngest son, Georgegoes shopping once or twice a week to the supermarket or the Hilltown farm shop.

Initially, we didn#t think anything was wrong with him. He even passed his seven month hearing test. We took him everywhere, first to a Harley Street doctor then to Manchester University Hospital for further tests. Later we took him to Holland to a school for the deaf in St Michelgestel. He was five when we discovered he had autism. That was another shock but it also helped us make sense of the way he was. You know, people sometimes say #poor you#. My answer to that is, it#s not poor us - it#s poor James, he#s the one who has to cope. But he has done brilliantly and has thrived at Parkanaur College, near Dungannon, working in the gardening centre, the upholstery workshop and he loves cooking. I think he#s coping well with the lockdown.How did she explain the situation to James I told him the whole world is sick and we have to stay at home. I crossed out all the exciting things on his calendar - weddings, family parties, holidays. He has taken it well and is quite a happy chap.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJames Mulholland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJames MulhollandHow has the lockdown affected business It has been a real challenge, and we have so much sympathy for the couples who have had to re-think their wedding plans, but everyone has been so cooperative, she says. All weddings to the end of June have been postponed, and even some July dates have reserved a back-up slot just in case. The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding. We hope that will work in our favour as lockdown eases. We are inviting couples who can#t get married on their chosen date to come for a picnic in the garden, once restrictions have eased. They will be able to enjoy the garden without anyone  around, so they can still make some happy memories for their day.What about tour groups All cancelled and I can#t see them starting up till much later in the year, Rosalind remarks. It is really hard for the hospitality industry. Mid Ulster Council has been fantastic and has organized regular Zoom presentations from key people in tourism, legal and financial experts and marketing gurus. Ironically,  was to be the year when so many businesses took off!‘Our BB is closed, weddings and events are cancelled ... we’re looking at ways to ersy’Just a few miles from Bushmills, Ballylough estate has been in the Traill family since . Down through the centuries, the beautul Georgian property has housed many distinguished residents, including Colonel William Traill, pioneer of the first commercially run hydro-electro powered tram system that once operated between Portrush and the Giant#s Causeway. In more recent times, current owners June and David Traill have put the historic property on the hospitality map, including running their house as a bed and breakfast.There is no farming here, so for us to make the property #wash its face# and bring in an income, we#ve had to come up with new business ideas, June explains.In keeping with our charity, Ballylough Living History Trust, we ran the popular event known as Battle of the Boar. I#m also interested in social prescription projects including taking therapies such as counselling outdoors. Now, everything is on hold.We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid June TraillOn March , my mother had a hip operation and when she came out of hospital three days later lockdown was just beginning. She needed three carers a day, so it was a no-brainer that I move in with her. I#ve been locked down at mum#s house ever since, while David looks after the house.June#s mum, Christine Wright, a well-known artist, isn#t the only one needing the Traills# help. We have some students from the charity staying at our house, she explains. They couldn#t get home as they live in remote Islands, as far away as Martinique. We all get on well and it#s great that they can keep in touch with their families via Skype and suchlike. We also have two of our sons at home. Henryand his brother Brucehave finished university but with the current situation I don#t know what#ll happen about finding jobs. Our other two boys, Shaneand Paddyare both working from home in England and, like everyone , we use the internet to stay connected.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJune and David Traill at their home in Bushmills FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJune and David Traill at their home in BushmillsCoronavirus has left the economy reeling and, as June points out, for many small businesses the prognosis is poor.Usually, our bed and breakfast funds a lot of the charity work, which we are continuing to support where possible. But now the BB is shut, which means our income is zero. We reinvested every penny into the business, so we had no profits. Weddings have been cancelled, which means refunding deposits that have already been used to upgrade the site. We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid.Sadly many, like those in the tourism sector who rely on a very short income period will be badly affected or, indeed, go under.June, however, maintains a glimmer of hope. I#m busy thinking of ways to ersy, she explains. We#ve had time to finish a little free publication about the heritage of the Ballylough area. We#ll be able to hand it out to visitors, guests and the local community. We#re also working on preserving and recreating some of the historical costumes on site, although no idea how we#ll eventually be able to showcase them. Meantime, we#re finishing all those little jobs that have waited for years to be done. The garden, in particular, is getting a lot more attention, so we have been planting plenty of veg and flowers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have good relations in terms of a political level but also at a medical level in conversations with the Republic on the decisions that they take.“But we have very intensive conversations within the UK about the timing of changes within the country.”Earlier, the First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill were also asked about an all Ireland dimension to any lockdown exit strategy.This followed an Executive meeting this week with the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney and the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.Mrs Foster commented: “I think I’ve always been clear that this is not a political issue .

That’s always been the modus operandi of the Executive, and certainly for me, in terms of the way forward.She said it was “critically important” to share information with the Irish Republic, but Stormont would continue to take advice from Northern Ireland’s Chief Medical Officer.Read More Coronavirus: As Executive plans to unveil #pathway to recovery#, Foster and O#Neill see no early easing of lockdownShe added: “There is a need not just to have a north-south approach, to what is going on, but also an east-west approach I’ve always believed that the totality of relationships are important in relation to tackling this virus - and that will continue to be my view.”Ms O’Neill added: “We talked about exit and recovery and how we can move at similar times given that the disease is obviously spreading at a similar way across the island...I think its just common sense, what happens in Derry and Donegal, they’re going to have knock on impact on each other“I think it’s important that where we can, we actually work in tandem and work our way through this.. as joint up as we possibly can.”Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Everybody knows me and it wasn#t long before I was inundated with offers from people who wanted to donate money.The sad thing is, there are literally hundreds of people in Derry who need help so the money is being spent as fast as it comes in. It is overwhelming.I am running here, there and everywhere with hampers but a few local businesses have come on board and are helping me with deliveries, food donations and things like that. Everybody has been fed, no one has run out of food and those who need a few pounds for oil or gas has got it.While Mr Doherty is hailed across Derry as a real local hero, he said helping people during this crisis brings him benefits, too.He said: I suffer from ADHD and this is good for my mental health, too, but I definitely would not consider myself a hero. I just like helping vulnerable people who are really, really stuck, he added.The Derry people are just amazing. I love them so much and they have been amazing. They know me and trust me and that is why this has worked so well. It is through them that I have been able to help so many others.This has affected hundreds of families but I think things will start to settle down soon because the Universal Credit payments will be coming through, butI have to keep doing what I am doing until the lockdown is lted then so be it.Belfast Most ReadThai police hold NI man after brutal murder of a prostituteTributes to man who built Northern Ireland#s #smallest church#NI past coronavirus peak but more people flouting lockdown guidelines, warns Chief Scientic OfficerAnger over #ring of steel# at Chinese Consulate in BelfastArmagh family tribute to #unbelievable# nurses after great-grandadloses fight in hospital ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued with set-backs. The revised timeline was for enrolment to commence in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. googletag.cmd.push “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. googletag.cmd.push “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ COMMITMENTS The commitment referred to above by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. Shortly after the ‘New Approach’ document was published it emerged that the exact financial package on the table was unknown. When revealed it was described as ‘woefully inadequate’ by Sinn Feacutein finance minister Conor Murphy. At the end of January, the Department for the Economysaid it was committed to delivering expansion of Ulster University’s Belfast campus and would provide UU with a poundm bailout to complete the build. In February, DfE was asked what funding the UK and Irish Governments have committed towards realising , undergraduate places at the Magee campus. DUP economy minister Diane Dodds said: “No funding has, as yet, been formally committed by the UK or Irish Governments towards increasing undergraduate places at the Magee Campus as outlined in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Finance remains in discussions with Her Majesty’s Treasuryon the UK Government financial package associated with the priorities in New Decade, New Approach.” For the past month all government departments have understandably been focused on their response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Finance and the Economy were both asked for comment but did not provide any at the time of publishing.

Liam Tunney tells the story of the Kilrea man who swapped the cleaver for the canvas and never looked back. Light plays a key role in County Derry artist Conor Larkin’s work, but for years he carried his own talent with such modesty that it seemed destined to remain in the shadows. The self-taught artist has taken the scenic route to turning his passion into a profession and began his working le in McAtamney’s on Kilrea’s Bridge Street. “I didn’t go to art school or anything, I just left school and got a job in the butchers,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I served my time in McAtamney’s and was there until I was  or . After that I did a bit of travelling, went to Australia and America and got that out of my system. “When I came back, I spent some time on building sites and picking fruit. I’ve only really been painting full time for the past five or six years.”  His artistic talent had not gone unnoticed though and was celebrated in the early days by one of his teachers at Crossroads Primary School. “Mrs Magill was the teacher at the time, and she brought my mum in to look at a picture I had painted. I was maybe P or P,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember her telling my mother that the painting was above what I should be doing for my age at that time. “That is my first real memory of somebody picking it up. I even remember what it was – it was a lorry with a sunset behind it. I remember that vividly.” “Even when I was a butcher, I decorated the windows at Christmas and kept painting old milk churns and that to get a few extra pounds. If I could find a smooth surface, I’d paint it. “I would do skateboards and stuff like that when I was at school and I was encouraged by my teachers, but I never took it any further. I was lazy, I suppose. “I ended up getting a job in a glass company and that was the first time I got a job where I was doing something creative.”  Conor’s work at Diamond Glass, in Slaughtneil, involved painting stained glass windows and he began to hone his creative talent, spending more time painting. Even as the shoots of a possible career change were appearing, Conor’s professional radar hadn’t been finely tuned just yet. “Probably the first few I did, I gave them away. It was easy to me, so I just gave them to people,” he said. “The first one I sold was a picture of the Fleadh in Rasharkin. Well, I didn’t actually sell it, I swapped it for an amplier for a guitar. “I had started it, but then realised there were too many people in it and this man approached me and said ‘Look,you finish that, I’ll buy you an amplier for it’. We were playing in a band together. I play a bit of guitar and sing a bit. I still have the amplier, but it probably wasn’t that great a deal when I look at it now!”  Although the talent and ambition were there, there was still the lingering thought that painting was destined only to be a hobby. It took the intervention of a local man to allow Conor to showcase his talent and provided the confidence boost he needed to move things to the next level. He said: “There was a fella in Kilrea called Brendan McAllister, from Edenbane Art. He does a bit of dealing and he askedI’d paint him a few just to see how it went. “I did a few paintings and never really thought much of them, but he came back a week later to say: ‘I’ve sold those, would you do a few more ’ “That made me realise that people were willing to buy them, and it gave me that bit of encouragement.”  If McAllister’s support provided the carrot, the stick came in the form of a conversation with a former butchering colleague, while he was still painting stained glass in Slaughtneil. “It was during that recession when things were getting bad. We were down to a three-day week and the stained glass work was getting less and less. “I got talking to one of the butchers I used to work with. He’s actually a chocolatier now and he said: “If you don’t jump, how are you going to find outyou can do it or not ”  Conor jumped, without looking back. Seven years later there is a -month waiting list for his commissions, requests for which arrive from all over the world. His inspiration though, stems from closer to home. “I live down near the Bann in Kilrea and I’m out on that road a dozen times a day usually,” he said. “There was one day there was a tree and whatever way the sun was shining on it, it got me. I ended up painting it a few times, at dferent times of the year. “Sunsets and autumn light are great. I get fidgety round that time of the evening and I have to get out and get looking at stuff. That’s what I mostly like to paint. “I also love painting old cottages. Sometimes I would drive round the country looking for old, deserted dwellings. I love the way the light plays on the whitewashed walls. “I think everybody has a nostalgic thing for them. Where I grew up, there was an old man who lived across the fields from us and I used to spend time before I went to school over there. “That was the real McCoy, no electricity or anything. There’s a romance about old houses., but there are less of them now. They conjure up memories for many people.”  The Covid- lockdown hasn’t been too taxing for Conor, who doesn’t mind the solitude. It is something to which he has become accustomed. “I’m finding it easy enough because I’m sort of used to it,” he said. “I live out in the sticks anyway so there are days I wouldn’t see a sinner, especially when my we is at work and the weans are at school. “I’m pretty much on my own most of the time anyway, but I do miss being able to jump in the car and head off to the coastI know there is going to be a nice sunset. “I do an online painting demo now every Thursday night from  o’clock. The first painting we did was a few cottages on an old lane and I’m planning to give that away to a key worker. “People are nominating others for it. Somebody on the front line will end up getting that painting. Every wee bit helps.” The Kilrea man carries conversation with the relaxed confidence of a man who has found the holy grail of job satisfaction by turning his hobby into his occupation. “I have done working on building sites, on farms and fruit picking, served my time as a butcher, but while I was doing that, I was always doing the odd wee drawing. “It’s what I’ve always wanted to do. The dream was always to pack in the day job and paint full time, so I suppose I’m living that dream.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The power and panache of Gerry McElhinney would have figured prominently in the Kingdom supremos thoughts. This week, Michael McMullan spoke to the all-star forward and former international soccer star. Thank God for YouTube. Gerry McElhinneys wonder point against the Dubs in  was  seconds of bliss. From his first solo until the ball cannoned off the wall behind the Hill  goals, its impossible not to be energised by watching it. For those who remember him playing, the memories came gushing back of one of the games greatest artists. For the rest, it makes us appreciate what a big game player actually is. googletag.cmd.push It was like the parting of the Red Sea, a Derry version of Maradona . He was just outside his own half, but distance was no obstacle It was All-Ireland semi-final day, but Derrys  year-old secret weapon played with expression. Termed by some as a pop star footballer, three months younger than Bjoumlrn Borg, McElhinney was inspired by the Swedes headband. It wasnt a spice-boy image without substance. Derrys sorcerer could also walk the walk. He was a boxing champion in his youth and his soccer career, as a centre-half, took him to Northern Irelands -  European qualier win over West Germany. googletag.cmd.push “It was the fastest  minutes, it just went past in a flash. It was just a game...all I wanted to do was play football,” McElhinney said of that night in Hamburg. He held captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge scoreless and on the periphery. McElhinneys shuddering tackle put down a marker early in the game. For all the stages he performed on, he was as modest as he was magical. No airs or graces, just fanatical about playing. Growing up, playing two games every Saturday and Sunday was the grounding that made him. The  All-Ireland semi-final was just an extension and commentator Michael OHehirs exhilarating tones announced Gerry McElhinney to the nation. He took one solo before thundering through a Dublin midfield who were clutching at straws. An explosion of power careered past four Dublin players. Nobody could get a hand on him. He was electrying. He kept the ball under perfect control, while in full flow. As goalkeeper Paddy Cullen came into view, Gerry squeezed a shot through two helpless defenders before it went over the bar. It wasnt enough to prise Sam Maguire away from the Dubs, but unbeknownst to him, it was another reason for the all-stars to select him in his debut season. “I was fit and I just went out and enjoyed myself,” McElhinney said, from his home in Draycott – between Nottingham and Derby - where he has lived with his second we Val for the last  years. “I was training about six nights a week. When I say it was easy...it just came to me. I learned a lot from experienced men around me, about what to do and where to go. I was no longer a baby, I was coming .” He teased opponents as much as he did the Derry fans, who had to be satisfied with four seasons at senior level. As his soccer career tapered to a conclusion, Fr Sean Hegarty recalled him for the  Ulster championship. He was sent on as a sub to try and save a lost cause in the semi-final with a rampant Donegal. With his head stitched up from colliding into a goalpost, he drove away from Clones that day, heading for Dublin to catch a boat. He was Peterborough bound, where he played his last years under manager Mark Lawrenson. “He was a big loss to Derry, he was talented and as tough as they come. He was a great player, even from a young age – a man before his time,” remembers former Derry manager Paddy Crozier, who played with McElhinney on the  Derry minor team beaten by Cavan in the Ulster final. Another Derry all-star, Johnny McGurk, was inspired by him and mesmerised by his dummy, calling it the McElhinney tip – one Owen Mulligan would later tease defences with. Gerry would win his only club championship in the colours of Craigbane. Their  winning goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin, who would have been directing kick-outs to him, made the comparison to Anthony Tohill. “He was the most complete player I remember, he had everything...until big Tohill came along.” Much water would pass under the bridge first. *** The late Mickey and Annie McElhinney raised their family in the townland of Dreen, outside Park, under the shadow of Sawel Mountain. Gerry is the oldest of , with five brothers , Colm, Kieran and five sisters . “We always played football in the field,” he recalls of his childhood. “The girls were the goalkeepers and the boys were playing out the field. We got neighbours over to play and it was always great craic.”  The family home outside Park Gerry would walk half a mile across the fields to attend Moneyhaughan Primary School, a typical country school with limited facilities, an outside toilet and no football pitch. “There was an old field beside it, but you wouldnt have put cows in it, never mind play football on it.” His early footballing days stem back to his time at secondary school in St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy. “Gerry Burns was the PE teacher and there was a guy Hugh Doherty,” McElhinney states. “He was a teacher, but most of the time he spent playing football in the gym.” Doherty pointed him in the direction of Dungiven Celtic, which started his soccer career. Gerry also mentions his former French teacher Seamus Mullan, who was also a local GAA reporter. “Sometimes he wrote good things about me and sometimes he wrote bad things about me,” Gerry laughs. “Seamus wrote about me because I think he wanted me to stay and play for Derry until the day I died. “Hughiewould take us to the hall. Wed play football and basketball there after school. My mother thought I was never coming home, I was never home to about six oclock at night.” There was no electric at home until Gerrys early teens. The first game he remembers watching on television was the replay of the  FA Cup Final. Having received a full blue kit as a present, he began to support Cha and after drawing with Leeds in the final, the replay at Old Trafford went to extra time. David Webb headed in at the far post from Ian Hutchinsons throw-in to win the cup for the blues. It lit a fire in McElhinney. “I thought I want to play at Wembley and I fulfilled my dreams,” he said, having later played at the famous stadium in Northern Irelands - defeat to England. He could have turned his hand to any sport. A natural, but his Gaelic football career would come first. *** Every Saturday morning in his teenage years, Gerry McElhinney would play for Derry City, before turning out for Dungiven Celtic in the afternoon. He played for Banagher on Sunday and hed squeeze in a game for Dungivens Sunday league team in the morning. “Banagher came first, butI could I would playin the morning. In the evening, we would maybe even have went off somewhere to a carnival and play a seven-a-side game,” McElhinney explains. “That was our weekend and during the week we trained. A lot of players did that. Mickey Lynch and Laurence OKane would have played for Derry City after they left the Irish League.” On the GAA front, Banagher knocked on the door of county finals, but never managed to squeeze into the winners enclosure. McElhinney had signed for Bolton by the time their  defeat to Ballinderry came around and an ankle injury in a soccer game the week before the  decider hampered his progress.  The Banagher squad pictured before the  Derry SFC Final.Gerry is fth from the left in the back row. “I ended up playing corner-back,” he remembers of the decision to start him, in the hope he would run it off. “I borrowed big Liam Hinpheys boots. He wore the rugby boots and I thought it would give my ankle some support.” He didnt last the game and Ballinderry edged home. In McElhinneys opinion, their best chance was against Magherafelt in the  final. “I remember both finals, it pissed down with rain. The Magherafelt game was in Swatragh and we definitely shouldve won that one. “We had three county players – Mickey Lynch, Fintan McCloskey and myself.Seamus Hasson had just retired from playing for Derry. SeamusStevenson was a dual player and played for Derry, so basically Banagher had five county players.” By the time his next championship run came around, he had crossed the county border. His first we hailed from Gortin and he played with the club for four seasons, during his time with Bolton. He wasnt the only newcomer. Liam Reilly – who also played in the  final - also moved to Tyrone and joined Gortin. Gortin reached the senior final in  against Augher, who had brothers Eugene and Dessie McKenna in their ranks and were champions three years earlier. It was Gortins first decider and McElhinneys absence was colossal. He had been known for getting the ball at midfield and rampaging all the way forward before hammering to the net. “I was with Bolton at the time and our pre-season had started, so I couldnt get over,” he said of their five-point defeat. It was time to head back to his roots and his brothers who had joined the emerging Craigbane. In  they beat Loup to win the first of seven intermediate titles, the record in the county. In , they were back in the final. This time it was against neighbours Claudy and Gerry McElhinney was in the team. “I was playing soccer and in the summer, at that time, I came home to visit my family and would stay for six or seven weeks. I played during championship time and won a few Dr Kerlin Cups,” he remembers. Craigbane were seven points down with seven minutes remaining and missed a first half penalty. The title was slipping away, but Conrad McGuigan found the net before player coach Paul Dixon hit a second goal to salvage a draw, - to -. “Tommy White and Charlie Kerrigan were playing, Claudy had a good side,” McElhinney explains.  Craigbanes winning team of . Gerry has his head bowed on the back row Dixon trained them like dogs for the two weeks before the replay. Six or seven sessions were combined with a challenge game with Donemana to sharpen their attacking game. The replay was a dferent story, with Craigbane in control, winning - to -. Gerry scored a point in the game. He later pulled his hamstring, but played on and later went to full-forward, as he picked up his only club championship medal. *** When Derry came knocking in the early s, McElhinney was in his prime. On top of an already bulging schedule, he boxed off and on for two years with Draperstown, under Jim Noonan. He holds a Mid Ulster title and was balancing the spinning plates. He had a spell in Glasgow Celtics reserves while playing at home with Derry minor footballers. Celtic was fitted in around his work, on a semi-professional deal. He failed to break into the first team, but would come for the weekend to play for the reserves. While Noonan urged him to keep his weight down, Jock Stein wanted him to bulk up. “My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney recalls of his time in Glasgow. “I was only  stone  and boxing welterweight, by the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry, I was  stone ...I went from welterweight to middleweight.” In , his first year out of minor, Frankie Kearney called him up to a Derry senior team gearing up for one of of the most successful eras in the countys history. “My Dad lted me at the airport on my way back from Celtic and took me straight to Magherafelt for a McKenna Cup game with Antrim and Gerry Armstrong was playing for them.” The season snowballed into a march to Croke Park. In Ulster, Derry needed a replay to see off Monaghan in the semi-final. They were staring defeat in the face when Eugene Laverty won a penalty that Peter Stevenson scored to give the Oakleafers a second chance. Five McElhinney points and his influence at midfield tamed the Farney men in the replay. In the final with Down, Gerrys early goal set Derry on their way to the first of their back to back titles. Man of the match was his Banagher teammate Mickey Lynch with - to his name. The Dubs ended their All-Ireland dreams, but the following year they retained the Ulster title and were humbled in the All-Ireland semi-final by the Kerry team at the beginning of their golden years. Mickey ODwyer rated Derry as the best team never to have won an All-Ireland. Did McElhinney think they were serious contenders  “We knew we were close when we ran Dublin to a point in the  league final. If we had won that  national league, we wouldve given the All-Ireland a run for it,” he remembers. “It is hard to pick it up after being beat by a point, especially in Croke Park on their home patch. “We had some great players on that team. Anthony McGurk was an all-star by that time. Sean OConnell and Seamus Lagan, sadly not with us anymore, they were all big guns then. “Tom McGuinness, Johnny OLeary and Mickey Lynch...Mickey was my team mate and we travelled everywhere together.” Eight points from Brendan Kelly and a man of the match performance from Anthony McGurk helped Derry to an extra time win over Cavan in the  Ulster final. Derry led by four points after  minutes of the All-Ireland semi-final final, with McElhinney in fine fettle at midfield, against Jack OShea. The Ulster champions led Kerry until early in the second half when super sub Seanie Walsh found the net. The wheels fell off the wagon as the Munster men rattled - in the second half. *** Wins over Tyrone and Donegal took Derry back to an Ulster final in . On the cusp of a third Ulster title and with the Connacht champions to come in the All-Ireland semi-final, they would avoid the Dubs and Kerry until the final. Armagh had other ideas. “Paddy Moriarty destroyed us and we just ran out of steam...that was a bad result.” said McElhinney of their - to - drubbing. He wouldfor the  season. Barring his late cameo in , he bowed away from the county scene. All too early, but his soccer career came calling. Also at that time, Mickey John Forbes ran charity football weekends and players from all over Ulster would play. “They came up from Kerry. It was a couple of times a year and you were getting as many at it, as youd get any many club finals. “There was a hooley after with singers like Susan McCann, Eileen Keane and Philomena Begley. All the top names turned out, it was almost like two all-star selects.” McElhinneys passport was well-stamped and he has been to USA over a dozen times during his career. “If Derry were ever knocked out of anything, I used to just go to America to play Gaelic. I played in New York for Sligo. A Banagher man, Martin Murphy, was manager there and he put me up. “They would fly me over for the weekend to play in Gaelic Park. I always remember the trains going past every ten minutes, alongside the pitch almost. “I played with Cavan in Philadelphia after Armagh beat us. Tom Farrelly was heavily involved in the GAA out there and I worked for him as a landscape gardener. “Tyrone were a big team out there most years with Frankie McGuigan and boys like Brendan Donnelly and Dominic Daly. We played against each other, but all met up and were the best of friends.” The summer of  was his last footballing foray across the Atlantic. “We won the championship in Chicago for Connemara Gaels. I worked out there and played out there. “There wasnt much training involved. They got you work on building sites and there were plenty of contractors out there, Irish guys who were trying to make a buck. “I remember having a car, it only cost me . I parked it up in the car park at OHare Airport and home I went.” Is the wagon still here, I ponder  “It might be,” McElhinney says with a laugh. With the s around the corner, it was soccer time. In part two, McElhinney rolls the clock back on Billy Bingham handing him his debut against the Germans and the trials and tribulations of transferring to the English leagues.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

The -strong group managed to raise pound, after abseiling down the Tower Museum building in Derry in the inaugural charity event at the beginning of March. Money raised from the event will go towards the pound million per year cost associated with running the le-saving Helicopter Emergency Medical Service . HEMS paramedic Jason Rosborough was among those who took part in the event and said the funds were vital to the running of the service. “As a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep us in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland,” said the Eglinton native. googletag.cmd.push “With the sponsorship raised for taking on this exciting challenge, we have all done our bit to raise much needed funds for Air Ambulance NI.” Earlier this year Jason told the County Derry Post why the HEMS service was so important. He said: “The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. “We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.” The service operates for  hours per day,  days a week and aims to reach anywhere in Northern Ireland within  minutes. googletag.cmd.push Regular donations allow AANI to better predict income levels to keep the helicopter flying and public support for the service is vital. Deputy Chair of AANI, Ian Crowe, has encouraged people to support their membership scheme. He said: “We are so grateful to everyone who took part in the Tower Museum Abseil, I put my fear of heights aside to join in. “The event was a brilliant success for the charity and something we will run again when the time is right. As a charity we rely on the support of local people to keep our helicopter flying. “With the current absence of fundraising events such as this one, I urge anyone who can to donate online or sign up to become a Club AANI member.” Anyone interested in becoming a member can contact AANI via email at info@airambulance.org or visit the website for more information.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story.

It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing.

Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me.

In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed.

Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact.

Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby.

He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Neil McCarthy says the anonymous doctor quoted in the News Letter \"simply revealed something that has been reported in US and Great Britain hospitals that medical staff have almost nothing to do\"Sinn Féin have even seen themselves successfully outflanked on an all Ireland approach to Covid- by the DUPin relation to families being able to visit the graves of their loved ones . With contact tracing set to resume shortly throughout the UK, any dferences between the approaches of the two administrations on this island have all but vanished and death rates from the disease in the two jurisdictions are almost identical.

Neil McCarthy is a writer and teacher based in Dublin and London : Other rd Party \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Two remarkable things have happened here in the last few days. First, Michelle O’Neill let slip at a news conference last Friday that, in her view, social distancing “[is] going to be a feature of our lives for perhaps up to a couple of years and beyond”. That this was not some uninformed solo run has been made clear in comments made to this newspaper by Queen’s University, Belfast medical professor Dr Ultan Power and expert virologist Dr Connor Bamford, also of QUB, in the days since. Both made comments broadly compatible with what the deputy first minister said. The second remarkable thing was the anonymous interview given to this newspaper by a doctor who has worked in one of Northern Ireland’s dedicated Covid- centres and published earlier this week. Doctors on Covid wards sitting around with nothing to do – whilst NI hospitals are nearly emptied of regular patients,’ April He simply revealed something that has been widely reported on in American hospitals and hospitals outside of the larger cities in Great Britain: that medical staff have almost nothing to do whilst people with legitimate non-coronavirus symptoms are not visiting out of fear. These are facts. PUP man and retired GP John Kyle has echoed his comments. Yet it would seem that these comments have brought on quite the backlash, to the extent that it was deemed necessary for an editorial comment to be released by the News Letter  to counter any possible offence taken, albeit that the editorial focussed on the doctor’s personal view that these facts meant for him that the lockdown is “doing at least as much harm as good”. I would add that on Channel  news this Wednesday evening, the second part of a special report showing how Craigavon Area General Hospital is dealing with the crisis contained an arresting moment when the director of Emergency Medicine took the reporter Paraic O’Brien into the special Accident and Emergency for respiratory patients and revealed it to be empty. When O’Brien expressed surprise, the director paused and said: “To see it empty is … unsettling.” These local developments are remarkable in my view because they show that even though the disease is clearly in retreat in Northern Ireland at the moment, there appears to be a stultying orthodoxy taking hold in our political and medical decision making circles. Social distancing is here to stay for the foreseeable future. The lockdown is here to stay for a good while too, and even when it comes to an end, it may well be followed by new ones should there be any upswing in cases. The ‘indirect’ costs of the lockdownare not to be talked about and our hospitals are, for the time being, for Covid patients and Covid patients alone. Bear in mind three sets of newly issued statistics this week: for cancer patients in the UK as a whole the Dailyreports that “lack of treatment during the coronavirus crisis” may lead to , excess cancer deaths in the next year British Airways have announced that they are planning to lay off, not furlough, , of their staffBBC health correspondent Nick Triggle has revealed that University of Bristol researchers have posited that a .% decline in the size of the economy is a “tipping point” whichreached would see a loss of three months of le on average across the population. These three terrying statistics were all released on the same day this week: Wednesday April th, one day after the anonymous doctor’s interview.The critical sentence uttered by that doctor, and the one that got this newspaper into trouble, was, let us remind ourselves, this: “the lockdown is doing at least as much harm as good.”You must admit, the good doctor certainly had a point.• Neil McCarthy is a writer and teacher based in Dublin and London• Editorial April :  ‘Lockdown has been an entirely appropriate precautionary response to a health crisis’• Neil McCarthy March : Some voices in Ireland have used Covid to cast Britain as backward—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

All we can do today is be whatever comfort we can to you at this dficult time.“Anyone who knew Tony ‘Archie’ Moore will know that he loved the social event of a big Wake and attended many a funeral in his day and yet here we are with just his family and a few friends here in this church.“It seems so surreal but as you all know we are living in strange times due to the restrictions imposed on us by the Coronavirus pandemic.“If these were normal times, this church would be overflowing such was Tony’s popularity.“He was first and foremost a giant of the community and the irony is, as much as he would have loved a big send off, he would have wanted us to do our best to respect the guidelines, to keep people safe and healthy at this unusual time.“Thanks to the wonders of technology, many of you in the community are watching online.”He also welcome members of Tony’s family from Australia who are also watching online.“We were all deeply saddened that Tony has left us and it is dficult to let go of the man we came to know and love.“We are privileged to be able to gather together as his family and friends here and online to pray for him.“Someone once said everyone gets to preach at their own funeral by the way they lived their le.“Well knowing Tony as I did, the man he was I believe he will preach very well.”He refered to the Gospel which was on the Beatitudes and said Tony was ‘keenly aware’ of all the blessings.“Those quality Jesus mentions became a lived reality for him.“He was keenly aware of all of the blessings God had given him and he was proud to share them with everyone he knew.“Today we mourn the death of Tony but we also celebrate a le well lived.“Tony was a man who loved le. His family was incredibly important to him and was one of the things that distinguished him and helped define who he was as a man. He loved his we Mary, his children and his grandchildren. There is nothing he wouldn’t do for them. The pain upon us is real but so is the joy.“Each one of you here and each one of you watching online have a story to tell about Tony. “We can look back at the times when Tony was so kind to so many, brightened and enriched lives.“We can see in him love through his love for others. We can see in him compassion, honesty, integrity and courtesy and how everyone was special to him. We can see in him his wonderful sense of humour. his smile and infectious laugh which lted all our spirits.”He spoke of how fondly people spoke of Tony on Facebook, describing him as ‘an absolute gentleman’.“He always had time for everbody. He was generous to a fault, always the first to give. He was a superb neighbour. He was one of le’s real gems. He was one of le’s good guys. He was always fun-loving. He was a great man to know. He never passed you by. Always ready for a chat. He was a wonderful human being and a real friend to all who knew him. He was one of the nicest people put on this earth.“These are just some of the hundreds of comments posted on Facebook. Comments from so many who will feel his loss keenly because of the person he was and with his unique gts he touched all our lives.“Tony was indeed a person who had a great abundance of humanity. He cared about people all his le.“He was born in Shankill in Lurgan whre he grew up but he would spend most of his le living in Craigavon.“He started his working career with Farrens then went to work in the Goodyear factory when it opened in  til its closure.“He was one of the founding members of the Goodyear Sports and Social Club and he will be remembered by many as the ‘Captain of the Ship’ at the Goodyear SSC where he facilitated s that raised thousands of pounds for charities.“He loved and enjoyed the craic and banter with all the people who came through the door over the years.“Tony had a great love for young people and when he was younger he worked as a volunteer youth leader for many years.“He was also a keen supporter of Armagh, Clan na Gael and Eire Og. He loved the GAA. He was a true Gael.“Tony Moore was truly special and that came from something within. And that something was his faith. Tony was a man of immense faith. He embraced his Catholic faith. His whole le was founded on a deep unshakeable faith.“I had the privilege of knowing Tony. He was a great friend to me and I can pay him no greater compliment when I say he was one of the best people you’d ever meet and it was a pleasure knowing him. He was one of le’s true gents. Quite simply, he was a legend who warmed our hearts and we were all privileged to have our lives touched by him.“Tony should have got a real good send off and I know the whole of Craigavon will come to a standstill as he gave everything to the people of Craigavon and beyond.
