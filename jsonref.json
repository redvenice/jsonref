Just be clear on how much money you’re going to miss out on.\u0027           Heartbreaking: This is one of the last pictures taken of the young musician, who was found dead in Muscat, Oman, on Friday, aged just 28          Top of the world: Avicii on stage with Madonna at  Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Florida in 2012Avicii made a fortune during his short career, cashing in $28million in 2014 alone - with his management team likely to have benefited greatly from the monetary success.The Swede earned $250,000 a night when playing out sold-out shows, according to GQ, and was once named as one of Forbes\u0027 highest paid DJs. Avicii himself was less bothered, saying in 2013 that he \u0027noticed straight away when I started making money, that I don\u0027t need that much money\u0027.In 2012 he donated the entire income of his U.S. tour - more than one million dollars - to hunger relief charity Feeding America, and in 2013 he gave one million euros to Swedish aid organisation Radiohjälpen.          Rest in peace: Oman authorities have ruled out foul play in connection with Avicii\u0027s deathBergling grew up in affluent Ostermalm in the Swedish capital Stockholm, and began producing music in high school.He made a name for himself on the EDM (Electronic Dance Music) scene, before his breakthrough hit Le7els in 2011. He would later become known for hits like Wake Me Up!, You Make Me, and recently Lonely Together, a collaboration with Rita Ora. He won two MTV Music Awards, one Billboard Music Award and earned two Grammy nominations. Just three days before his death, in his final post on Twitter, Bergling thanked the Billboard Music Award\u0027s jury for his nomination int the Top DanceElectronic Album category for his EP Avīci (01).He died on April 20 in Muscat, Oman, where he is reported to have been holidaying with friends.The cause of death is not yet known, but Oman police say they have ruled out any criminal activity. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/17/4B8B455700000578-5656731-image-a-136_1524672793010.jpg","title":"Queen pays tribute Royal Tank Regiments hard work ingenuity presents new standard","story":"    Queen Elizabeth II, Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Tank Regiment, after presenting the regiment with their new standard in St George\u0027s Hall at Windsor Castle in Berkshire          Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to the efforts of the Royal Tank Regiment as she presented the unit with a new standard          The queen\u0027s grandfather, King George V, (pictured) visited trials of early tanks at Elveden in Suffolk in July 1916  Queen Elizabeth II presents the Royal Tank Regiment with a new standard in St George\u0027s Hall at Windsor Castle in BerkshireThe Queen highlighted the \u0027unbreakable connection\u0027 that has existed between the sovereign and the Royal Tank Regiment since her grandfather, King George V, visited trials of early tanks at Elveden in Suffolk in July 1916.She told the servicemen, who were joined by their partners: \u0027Of course much has changed since 1916.

What about other terminally ill children, the greiving families we know nothing about? What about the seriously ill teenagers and young people at Alder Hey?This case is consuming huge medical and legal resources as (increasingly) parents with terminally ill children (like the tragic case of Charlie Gard at Great Ormand Street) challenge experts and demand the right to intervene.I do not have children, so you might think I can’t speak from experience - but that’s not the case.            The family of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have released pictures of the little boy clinging to life in his mother\u0027s arms 10 hours after his life support was removedI married a wonderful man whose 7 year old son had suffered brain damage shortly after birth, a condition that was not immediately spotted by the hospital. My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/24/18/4B827DC000000578-0-image-a-33_1524592027003.jpg","title":"British Iranian academic seized Iran bargaining chip","story":"    Abbas Edalat is a professor of computer science and mathematics at Imperial College LondonCHRI said Mr Edalat refused to post bail on Wednesday, arguing that he was innocent and should be released unconditionally.The group said Mr Edalat\u0027s home in Tehran had been raided and his computer was confiscated, as well as CDs and notebooks.\u0027We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities following reports of the arrest of a British-Iranian dual national,\u0027 a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. Mr Edalat is the latest of dozens of dual nationals detained by Iran since the 2015 nuclear deal. Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the CHRI, said: \u0027Iran\u0027s continued arbitrary arrests of dual nationals without transparency and lack of due process is extremely concerning,\u0027 said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the CHRI.\u0027The Iranian judiciary and the security establishment, particularly the Revolutionary Guards, are responsible for the well being of these detainees.\u0027\u0027If Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like...\u0027Make our planet great again\u0027: Emmanuel Macron uses joint...Supreme Court justices appear set to hand Trump major...Share this articleExperts believe Tehran use detainees as bargaining chips in negotiations with Western countries.Mr Edalat\u0027s arrest comes at a crunch moment for the future of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.Donald Trump must decide by 12 May whether to reimpose US sanctions on Tehran, which would effectively remove the US from the agreement.

It was a defensive fortress built by William I (reign, 1066-1087) circa 1086 to guard the Thames valley against any marauding Saxons bold enough to challenge his supremacy. He chose the commanding spot on top of a 100ft cliff overlooking the River Thames which provided easy access to the capital. William first built up a mound of earth to create an artificial hill and then erected a wooden palisade (staked structure) above it. At the base was a ditch, which could be filled with water if necessary, as a defensive measure. Surrounding the base, within the lower walls, was the bailey. Beyond the walls lay several homesteads, which may have acted as a gatehouse, along with several fields for the rearing of livestock. The site had a large staff of servants and defenders and also served as a marketplace for the townspeople, which created growth in the area. The main route from the fort led down to the river for the transportation of goods for trading in London. All that remains of this structure today is the mound on which Windsor Castle\u0027s iconic Round Tower stands          THE CASTLE DURING THE SIEGE OF 1216. The failure by King John (reign, 1199–1216) to honour the commitments set out in the Magna Carta led to civil war. The rebel barons offered the throne of England to Louis, son of Philip II of France, who landed at Sandwich with a French army in May 1216. This drawing shows Windsor Castle during the two-month siege by Louis\u0027s army. By 1100, Henry I had built domestic quarters within the fortress, while his grandson Henry II transformed it into a palace in the late 12th century - including replacing the timber walls with stone. He built two sets of royal apartments - a public residence in the Lower Ward (to the left) and a smaller private residence on the north side of the Upper Ward (right) exclusively for himself. By this stage, walls and towers had also been constructed along the three sides of the upper bailey (the courtyard area seen to the right). Also visible is one of Windsor\u0027s most famous features - the Round Tower crowning the central mount - which was built by Henry II. In addition, the late 12th century gave rise to lodging for the king, a chapel, kitchens and Great Hall          CASTLE DURING THE REIGN OF HENRY III: The reign of Henry III (1216–72) ushered in a richer era in the history of English royal building and court culture. He improved the royal apartments, renovated many of the other buildings and  further fortified the stone walls. Research has shown that much of the Castle\u0027s 12th- and 13th-century masonry, illustrated in this drawing, survives within the present buildings - with St George\u0027s Chapel (seen centre in the Lower Ward section) inside the walls. The chapel was built in the 1240s by the king. From 1222 onwards, extensive work was carried out on the great hall in the outer bailey, the \u0027king\u0027s houses,\u0027 the \u0027houses on the mount,\u0027 and the tower enclosing them. New towers were also built, which were then connected by a strong, curved wall for defence.

This artist\u0027s impression shows the room being prepared for the Garter feast of April 28, 1476, during the reign of Edward IV (1461–83). The room was probably quite plain, but when the court was in residence it was transformed with rich wall hangings, furniture and gold and silver plate. Here, the wall hangings are decorated with the motif of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior Order of Chivalry in Britain, founded by Edward III at Windsor          PAINTED CHAMBER IN THE ROSE TOWER, 1366: Edward III (reign, 1327–77) - the \u0027warrior\u0027 king - is best known for his lengthy campaigns in France during the Hundred Years War. He spent £50,000 transforming Windsor into a Gothic palace, rebuilding the Castle\u0027s Upper Ward to include square towers and high octagonal stair turrets. This illustration shows the small octagonal \u0027Painted Chamber\u0027 of the Rose Tower (today known as King John\u0027s Tower) in Edward III\u0027s day. The colour scheme is based on a surviving fragment of decoration, which suggests that the walls were covered with a pattern of almond-shaped panels containing red, green and gold roses on a red background  Harry and Meghan (left, earlier this week at Westminster Abbey to commemorate Anzac Day) will marry on May 19 at St George\u0027s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle in Berkshire          The Queen Mother inspects the 300th Anniversary Parade of the Grenadier Guards at Windsor Castle with Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Princess Margaret in 1956Windsor Castle was a favourite residence of Elizabeth I. Hans Eworth\u0027s Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses, 1569, is thought to include the earliest painted representation of the Castle.During the Civil War of 1642–51, the castle was occupied by Parliamentarians and used as a prison to hold Royalist supporters. Prisoners\u0027 graffiti is still visible today in a room above the Norman Gate.Windsor Castle first became a tourist destination between 1714–76, when the court and royal family rarely visited. Visitors came by coach or barge from London to walk along the terraces, view St George\u0027s Chapel and tour the State Apartments led by the Housekeeper. The first guidebook was introduced in 1749.In 1747, the Italian artist Canaletto visited Windsor to record the castle for Sir Hugh Smithson, one of Canaletto\u0027s most important patrons in England.A 1763 inventory of the Round Tower apartments of the castle\u0027s Constable and Governor, the Earl of Cardigan, includes a room for his servant Ignatius Sancho, a composer, actor and writer. Sancho was the first-known Briton of African heritage to vote in a British election and lobbied for abolition of the slave trade.The appearance of the Round Tower dates from the major remodelling of Windsor in the 1820s by George IV. In line with the king’s romantic notion of castle architecture, the tower was heightened by nine metres and given Gothic-style battlements.In June 1887, George Sanger\u0027s travelling circus paraded in the Quadrangle before Queen Victoria and her grandchildren, and gave a performance on the East Lawn. In her journal, the Queen describes 100 horses, 50 ponies, seven elephants, five lions, three camels, a cage of tigers, leopards, a puma, a kangaroo, a monkey, three llamas and an Indian bull.In 1911, Queen Mary persuaded King George V to reintroduce weekly band concerts for the public, which had last taken place at the castle during George III\u0027s reign.In 1924, Queen Mary was presented with a dolls\u0027 house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a gift from the nation. After its display at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, the miniature house was installed permanently at the castle.During the Second World War, the Royal Archives were evacuated from the Round Tower to an underground space beneath the castle known as the South Bowe. In addition to being an official royal residence and one of the principal homes of the Royal Family, Windsor Castle encompasses St George\u0027s Chapel and has been home to the College of St George since 1348. In total, more than 160 people live within the precincts of the Castle as part of a community that has been based there for seven centuries.           Fire broke out at the castle, damaging more than 100 rooms, in November 1992, in a year described by the Queen as her \u0027annus horribilis\u0027                         "},{"url":null,"title":"National Lottery Lotto results Wednesday 25th April","story":"Xbox Games with Gold: May 2018 free lineup revealed for Xbox One and 360Kim Kardashian \u0027to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday 30 April\u0027When is Mother\u0027s Day in the US?

She made the Dutch team as a sprinter and her coach, Jan Blankers, who would later become her husband, encouraged her to enter the Berlin 1936 Olympic trials.At 18, Fanny was selected to compete in the high jump and 4x100m relay at the Games but came in fifth place for both events. Here, she met her idol Jesse Owens and got his autograph, which became her most treasured possession.In 1938, Fanny earned her first world record and won international medals resulting in many expecting her to excel in the upcoming Helsinki Olympic Games in 1940. However, with the outbreak of World War II, the competition was cancelled a week before the Netherlands was invaded.Fanny Blankers-Koen  children and husbandBefore WWII, Fanny had become engaged to her coach Jan and on August 29, 1940, the couple were married.At the time, Jan coached the Dutch women’s athletics team and a sports journalist, even though he originally believed that women should not compete in sport. This changed after his feelings towards Fanny changed.After Fanny gave birth to her first child, Jan Junior, in 1941, it was assumed that her career was over, as at the time, it was unusual for female athletes to be married and even more so, to be mothers. As the war went on, she earned six more world records between 1942 and 1944 in athletics.          After Fanny gave birth to Jan Junior in 1941, it was assumed that her sporting career was overNotably in 1943, Fanny improved on her high jump record by 5cm to 1.71m at a special competition in Amsterdam and she tied the 100m world record but this was not formally recognised as she was competing against men when setting the record.The war meant that food was scarce and the winter of 1944-1945, also known as the Hongerwinter, Fanny and other athletes were forced to take a break from competing. However, at the 1946 European Championship, Fanny made a comeback weeks after giving birth to Fanny Junior.Although she received a lot of backlash for competing and not staying home with her children, she continued. She told the New York Times in 1982 that she ‘got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with - how do you say it? - short trousers’.British team manager Jack Crump also said that she was ‘too old to make the grade’, unaware that she was actually three months pregnant at the time. At the 1948 Olympics, Fanny won four of nine women’s events: 100m, 80m hurdles, 200m and 4x100m relay and became the first to win four golds in a single Olympics.She became known as the ‘Flying Housewife’, the ‘Flying Dutchmam’ and ‘Amazing Fanny’ by the press and was praised on her return to Amsterdam. Reporters described her style as ‘like she was chasing kids out of the pantry’ and ‘racing to the kitchen to rescue a batch of burning biscuits’.She was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange Nassau.          On her return to Amsterdam, Fanny was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange NassauFanny Blankers-Koen controversyHowever, after a period of fame and travelling abroad to promote women in sport, a new talent Foekje Dillema emerged and was dubbed the ‘new Fanny’ after she broke the record for 200m.However, tests on cells obtained from her clothing found that Dillema had a Y-chromosome in her DNA and she was possibly a 46XX46XY woman.This deformation is also known as ovotesticular DSD or true hermaphroditism and many believed that this new development was an attempt by Jan and Fanny to eliminate the competition, but these are just rumours.          Foekje Dillema, dubbed the \u0027new Fanny\u0027 seen here shaking hands with Fanny Blankers-KoenFanny Blankers-Koen cause of deathFanny competed in two more Olympic Games and her last ever winning event was the shot put in August 1955, her 58th Dutch title. She also won the 200m by 0.7 second - the highest margin in Olympic 200m history and a record that still stands today.She went on to serve as the Dutch athletics team team leader and after Jan died in 1977, she moved back to her hometown.In 1981, the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games were established and still held annually to this day. She was also commended at a gala in Monaco, organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and was declared the ‘Female Athlete of the Century’.Prior to her death, she suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and lived in a psychiatric nursing home. Fanny died at age 85 in Hoofddorp on January 25, 2004.What is a Google Doodle?In the Google Doodle for April 26, 2018, Fanny Blankers-Koen is honoured on what would have been her 100th birthday and is depicted running ahead of the rest on a track.

What about the seriously ill teenagers and young people at Alder Hey?This case is consuming huge medical and legal resources as (increasingly) parents with terminally ill children (like the tragic case of Charlie Gard at Great Ormand Street) challenge experts and demand the right to intervene.I do not have children, so you might think I can’t speak from experience - but that’s not the case.            The family of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have released pictures of the little boy clinging to life in his mother\u0027s arms 10 hours after his life support was removedI married a wonderful man whose 7 year old son had suffered brain damage shortly after birth, a condition that was not immediately spotted by the hospital. My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/21/4B8E60C700000578-0-image-a-24_1524688358911.jpg","title":"Windsor Castle ages","story":"    WINDSOR CASTLE IN ITS EARLIEST FORM, 1086: This illustration shows Windsor as a motte-and-bailey castle - \u0027motte\u0027 being a mound, and \u0027bailey\u0027 an enclosed courtyard. It was a defensive fortress built by William I (reign, 1066-1087) circa 1086 to guard the Thames valley against any marauding Saxons bold enough to challenge his supremacy. He chose the commanding spot on top of a 100ft cliff overlooking the River Thames which provided easy access to the capital. William first built up a mound of earth to create an artificial hill and then erected a wooden palisade (staked structure) above it. At the base was a ditch, which could be filled with water if necessary, as a defensive measure. Surrounding the base, within the lower walls, was the bailey. Beyond the walls lay several homesteads, which may have acted as a gatehouse, along with several fields for the rearing of livestock. The site had a large staff of servants and defenders and also served as a marketplace for the townspeople, which created growth in the area. The main route from the fort led down to the river for the transportation of goods for trading in London. All that remains of this structure today is the mound on which Windsor Castle\u0027s iconic Round Tower stands          THE CASTLE DURING THE SIEGE OF 1216. The failure by King John (reign, 1199–1216) to honour the commitments set out in the Magna Carta led to civil war. The rebel barons offered the throne of England to Louis, son of Philip II of France, who landed at Sandwich with a French army in May 1216. This drawing shows Windsor Castle during the two-month siege by Louis\u0027s army. By 1100, Henry I had built domestic quarters within the fortress, while his grandson Henry II transformed it into a palace in the late 12th century - including replacing the timber walls with stone. He built two sets of royal apartments - a public residence in the Lower Ward (to the left) and a smaller private residence on the north side of the Upper Ward (right) exclusively for himself. By this stage, walls and towers had also been constructed along the three sides of the upper bailey (the courtyard area seen to the right). Also visible is one of Windsor\u0027s most famous features - the Round Tower crowning the central mount - which was built by Henry II. In addition, the late 12th century gave rise to lodging for the king, a chapel, kitchens and Great Hall          CASTLE DURING THE REIGN OF HENRY III: The reign of Henry III (1216–72) ushered in a richer era in the history of English royal building and court culture. He improved the royal apartments, renovated many of the other buildings and  further fortified the stone walls. Research has shown that much of the Castle\u0027s 12th- and 13th-century masonry, illustrated in this drawing, survives within the present buildings - with St George\u0027s Chapel (seen centre in the Lower Ward section) inside the walls. The chapel was built in the 1240s by the king. From 1222 onwards, extensive work was carried out on the great hall in the outer bailey, the \u0027king\u0027s houses,\u0027 the \u0027houses on the mount,\u0027 and the tower enclosing them. New towers were also built, which were then connected by a strong, curved wall for defence.

This artist\u0027s impression shows the room being prepared for the Garter feast of April 28, 1476, during the reign of Edward IV (1461–83). The room was probably quite plain, but when the court was in residence it was transformed with rich wall hangings, furniture and gold and silver plate. Here, the wall hangings are decorated with the motif of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior Order of Chivalry in Britain, founded by Edward III at Windsor          PAINTED CHAMBER IN THE ROSE TOWER, 1366: Edward III (reign, 1327–77) - the \u0027warrior\u0027 king - is best known for his lengthy campaigns in France during the Hundred Years War. He spent £50,000 transforming Windsor into a Gothic palace, rebuilding the Castle\u0027s Upper Ward to include square towers and high octagonal stair turrets. This illustration shows the small octagonal \u0027Painted Chamber\u0027 of the Rose Tower (today known as King John\u0027s Tower) in Edward III\u0027s day. The colour scheme is based on a surviving fragment of decoration, which suggests that the walls were covered with a pattern of almond-shaped panels containing red, green and gold roses on a red background  Harry and Meghan (left, earlier this week at Westminster Abbey to commemorate Anzac Day) will marry on May 19 at St George\u0027s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle in Berkshire          The Queen Mother inspects the 300th Anniversary Parade of the Grenadier Guards at Windsor Castle with Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Princess Margaret in 1956Windsor Castle was a favourite residence of Elizabeth I. Hans Eworth\u0027s Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses, 1569, is thought to include the earliest painted representation of the Castle.During the Civil War of 1642–51, the castle was occupied by Parliamentarians and used as a prison to hold Royalist supporters. Prisoners\u0027 graffiti is still visible today in a room above the Norman Gate.Windsor Castle first became a tourist destination between 1714–76, when the court and royal family rarely visited. Visitors came by coach or barge from London to walk along the terraces, view St George\u0027s Chapel and tour the State Apartments led by the Housekeeper. The first guidebook was introduced in 1749.In 1747, the Italian artist Canaletto visited Windsor to record the castle for Sir Hugh Smithson, one of Canaletto\u0027s most important patrons in England.A 1763 inventory of the Round Tower apartments of the castle\u0027s Constable and Governor, the Earl of Cardigan, includes a room for his servant Ignatius Sancho, a composer, actor and writer. Sancho was the first-known Briton of African heritage to vote in a British election and lobbied for abolition of the slave trade.The appearance of the Round Tower dates from the major remodelling of Windsor in the 1820s by George IV. In line with the king’s romantic notion of castle architecture, the tower was heightened by nine metres and given Gothic-style battlements.In June 1887, George Sanger\u0027s travelling circus paraded in the Quadrangle before Queen Victoria and her grandchildren, and gave a performance on the East Lawn. In her journal, the Queen describes 100 horses, 50 ponies, seven elephants, five lions, three camels, a cage of tigers, leopards, a puma, a kangaroo, a monkey, three llamas and an Indian bull.In 1911, Queen Mary persuaded King George V to reintroduce weekly band concerts for the public, which had last taken place at the castle during George III\u0027s reign.In 1924, Queen Mary was presented with a dolls\u0027 house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a gift from the nation. After its display at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, the miniature house was installed permanently at the castle.During the Second World War, the Royal Archives were evacuated from the Round Tower to an underground space beneath the castle known as the South Bowe. In addition to being an official royal residence and one of the principal homes of the Royal Family, Windsor Castle encompasses St George\u0027s Chapel and has been home to the College of St George since 1348. In total, more than 160 people live within the precincts of the Castle as part of a community that has been based there for seven centuries.           Fire broke out at the castle, damaging more than 100 rooms, in November 1992, in a year described by the Queen as her \u0027annus horribilis\u0027                         "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/11/4B92BD9900000578-5659633-The_coach_driver_continues_down_the_road_with_the_Bentley_follow-m-16_1524738832891.jpg","title":"Idiot Bentley driver overtakes coach zebra crossing people it","story":"    Dashcam footage filmed on a 40-tonne coach shows the pricey motor\u0027s \u0027idiot\u0027 driver attempt to cut in front of the huge vehicle just seconds before the brazen overtake          The coach driver continues down the road with the Bentley following up the rear as they approach a pedestrian crossingPolice cars give two people riding on a 8mph mobility...Terrifying decision to overtake leaves truck driver shocked...Terrifying dashcam footage shows two death-wish drivers...Share this article\u0027I hit my brakes and horn and he obviously decided he wouldn\u0027t make it (which he wouldn\u0027t have) and stopped before hitting the side of the coach or mounting the pavement.\u0027 As the coach stops to allow two men to cross a pedestrian crossing, the impatient Bentley driver is seen zooming across on the wrong side of the road.           Two men then cross over the road as the coach driver waits patiently at the crossing           The \u0027idiotic\u0027 Bentley driver then overtakes on the wrong side of the road across the pedestrian crossing           Despite the \u0027unbelievable\u0027 manoeuvre, the Bentley driver is no further ahead in traffic and is still stuck behind the blue 4x4\u0027He decides to drive on the opposite side of the road, the wrong side of the central reservation and into oncoming traffic at speed nearly causing an accident,\u0027 the coach driver added. \u0027He then swerves in front of the 4x4 and into an active bus lane.\u0027Despite the \u0027unbelievable\u0027 manoeuvre, the Bentley driver is no further ahead in traffic and is still stuck behind the blue 4x4."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/12/4B88960D00000578-5659893-The_mother_uses_a_shovel_in_a_bid_to_fend_of_the_angry_bird_s_fe-a-34_1524743196313.jpg","title":"Mother defend giant bird shovel","story":"The furious bird charged at Heather Waddington while she was inside its pen in Helmshore, Lancashire          The mother uses a shovel in a bid to fend of the angry bird\u0027s feathery onslaught as it chases her around its enclosure Ms Waddington, from Baxenden, Lancashire, said: \u0027When I saw the bird coming after me, I s**t myself.

The weak pound, which is a boon for these firms, has helped the index of bluechip British shares rise by almost 400 points over the past month. Fears over a potential trade war between China and the US rattled markets earlier in the month but a softer tone from Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has placated investors.The spectre of a damaging global trade war triggered by Donald Trump could dent the ambition of leading Brexiters to strike free trade deals with the rest of the world after the UK leaves the EU. For now, despite the warning signs, there was better news last month in the narrowing UK trade deficit. The trade deficit highlights the difference between what Britain sells abroad and what it imports. In February, this narrowed to £10.2bn, down from £12.2bn in January. There were signs that the freezing weather and heavy snow early last month brought the UK economy to a standstill, raising questions over whether the Bank of England would raise interest rates in May. Barometers of business activity in the construction and services sectors fell sharply, with the latter recording the worst month for activity since the Brexit vote. The IHS MarkitCIPS all sector purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.1, down from 54.2 on a gauge where a reading of 50 splits the difference between expansion and contraction. As a result, economists are forecasting a fall in economic growth for the first quarter of 2018 by about half from the final months of last year. Philip Hammond received good news from the public finances last month, with figures showing the UK budget deficit had narrowed to the lowest annual level since the financial crisis. According to the ONS, public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell by £3.5bn to £42.6bn in the last financial year – making 2017-18 the best year for the budget deficit since the year ending March 2007. The shortfall between how much the government spends and what it receives from taxes was £2.6bn lower than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Meanwhile, the chancellor had hinted during the spring statement he could raise spending in the autumn budget should the public finances remain on track. Brexit uncertainty is weighing heavily on the UK property market, where house price growth has slowed across the country and in reverse in London. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed demand from buyers fell for the 12th consecutive month in March, coupled with the seventh month in a row for fewer new instructions from sellers. Meanwhile, official figures from the ONS showed the first annual fall for house prices in London since the depths of the last recession in 2009.

Deluded. Emotive nonsense. These are unusually strong terms for a judge to use, particularly in a case as intensely sad and bitterly contested as that of the terminally ill child Alfie Evans. Yet Mr Justice Hayden, referring to some of the campaigners now surrounding Alfie’s parents, did not mince his words, after this most hellish of ethical dilemmas ended this week in a court ruling that the child’s ventilator be switched off against the family’s\u0026nbspwishes.The judge was careful not to attach blame to Tom Evans and Kate James, who cannot accept the settled view of their son’s doctors that his brain has been damaged catastrophically by an as yet undiagnosed condition, or that the intensive treatment required to keep him alive is no longer in his best interest and may be causing him suffering.Alfie’s parents have fought like tigers both in and out of court and no parent – even those whose sympathies in this case are with the doctors facing death threats for doing what they honestly believe is the right thing – will begrudge the family their right to clutch in their grief at every straw there is.But the high court judge is surely right to question the motives of some of those extending straws. The most disturbing aspect of this case is the sense that it is now being exploited by those who see Alfie not as a desperately sick little boy, but as an expedient means of advancing their own ideological cause.That description doesn’t just apply to the pro-life movement, of course. Among Alfie’s viscerally engaged army of Facebook supporters, which includes many parents of small children, you will find anti-vaxxers using the story to peddle utterly deluded junk science theories about the Vitamin K injection every newborn gets. You’ll find American gun lobby enthusiasts ranting on about how this is what happens when “the government” runs people’s lives and that’s why everyone needs to keep hold of their weapons never mind that this decision has nothing to do with the government, resting as it does on the independent judgment of doctors upheld by an independent judiciary.Others have sought to use the case to score cheap, wildly inaccurate points over healthcare reform in the US to claim this is where “socialised medicine” gets you, when without the NHS and its daily miracle of providing treatment free at the point of use, Alfie’s parents would now be struggling with medical bills running into the millions.And where far-right conspiracy sites such as Infowars and Breitbart rush in, an army of trolls inevitably follows. Staff at Alder Hey children’s hospital have experienced a horrific barrage of death threats and other online abuse. There have been ugly scenes at the hospital too, reports of over-zealous protesters blocking ambulances or intimidating visitors and patients. It is all too uncomfortably reminiscent of those who harass pregnant women outside abortion clinics and threaten to kill doctors offering terminations, so high on their self-righteous mission to save that all other human lives cease to matter.But none of that is quite what the judge meant. His concern centres specifically on the way the Evans family has been taken under the wing of a hitherto little-known evangelical group called the Christian Legal Centre, which has supplied the parents with a barrister and, somewhat dubiously, the services of a law student named Pavel Stroilov. A statement drafted for Alfie’s father was, according to Hayden, loaded with “vituperation and bile” against the hospital, which had not helped the baby’s case. At one point, Stroilov apparently became party to an attempt by Alfie’s father to have the doctors prosecuted for murder.The family’s former solicitor Mary Holmes has accused activists of seeking to “keep this child alive at any costs and not for the right reasons”, using the case to raise their profile with interventions such as securing Tom Evans an audience with the pope. Most seriously, Stroilov stands accused of giving Evans inaccurate advice in a letter stating that he had the legal right to remove his son from the hospital, despite a court order to the contrary, causing an understandably emotional standoff between the parents and the hospital when it became clear that was not the case. What is compassionate or Christian about giving a desperate man false hope?The judge’s objection to an outpouring of what he called “emotive nonsense” in his courtroom is not to be confused with heartlessness. Rather, it is a recognition that courts are the one place where, in cases like these, reason can still prevail over white-hot emotion that their job is to provide a calm enough environment for doctors facing impossibly difficult choices to explain their clinical reasoning, and for evidence to be considered on its merits. For in British law, what matters is what is in the best interest of the child, not of the parents or the doctors or wider public opinion, and certainly not of organised religion. The court process functions only when the adults involved can be mature enough to put their own interests to one side, which means lawyers in such cases acting as advocates for their clients – not campaigners advancing their own beliefs.And while advocacy may mean fighting to the bitter end, there are times when it means gently introducing a client to the idea that it is time to stop that however unreconciled they are to a painful verdict, it isn’t going to change. It is a conversation that would be familiar, ironically enough, not only to doctors but to priests.The church’s role can be to give hope where secular medicine has none. Light a candle, say a prayer, and just for a minute you might believe in a miracle. Yet that is not its only role at the end of life, when the dying and the grieving are looking as much for comfort as for hope and for help in accepting the inevitable with grace. As Psalm 23: 4 has it, “Yea, though I walk through the shadows of the valley of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me.” This family is walking through the shadows of that valley now, and they deserve to be accompanied by people with only their best interests at heart. May they find the comfort and grace they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37815adb76d18772e549176435733cb9ef6d3e01/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?w=685\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=eb50ef6dd7d7b6c5be5ae8bb8473cd83 1370w","title":"youre the one that i want grease inspired summer fashion in pictures","story":"Celebrating its 40th anniversary, Grease is still lightning in the style stakes – as these chic Rydell High School-inspired outfits attest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15bb76988e0d5d3fb92141ddead2357a1b44f3f7/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=880a61e4c6c8c3006b037a761ee60374","title":"arsenal atletico madrid europa league semi final first leg match report","story":"Arsène Wenger was mindful of the pitfalls, the potential for anti-climax, as he put it, in his final home European tie as Arsenal manager. He wants what would be a first European trophy more than anything right now. Would this Europa League semi-final, first leg prove too demanding, particularly against opposition as streetwise as Atlético Madrid?Happily for him, his players played with verve and personality from the first whistle, pouring everything into the challenge and there were times, especially in the opening period of the first half, when they subjected Atlético to a gruelling examination.The team that sit second in La Liga and has established a stellar reputation on the European scene under Diego Simeone were reduced to 10 men after only 10 minutes, following Sime Vrsaljko’s two yellow cards. They were rattled and Simeone was sent to the stands after overheating at the referee, Clément Turpin, in the 13th minute.Arsenal could not find a goal during their period of ascendency but they broke through on 61 minutes thanks to Alexandre Lacazette. A stirring occasion had lift-off. And yet what Wenger feared most deeply would come to pass. Arsenal failed to put the 10 men away and they would be undermined by a darkly familiar defensive error.Laurent Koscielny had the position on Antoine Griezmann following a high punt forward but he erred badly and, suddenly, the Atlético striker was in. His first shot was saved and Shkodran Mustafi looked to have taken up a good covering position. But Mustafi slipped, Griezmann scored on the rebound and it was advantage Atlético.Vrsaljko’s dismissal shaped the tie, setting a combustible tone, and the Croatia right-back was certainly guilty of a rare form of recklessness, even if both of his cautions were defined by the strictest application of the law. The first one was for a lunge on Jack Wilshere, after Vrsaljko had been played into trouble by José Giménez and with that in mind, he ought to have thought twice about stretching into a tackle on Lacazette in a non-threatening area. He did not.Vrsaljko was late and he trod on the top of Lacazette’s foot. He gave Turpin a decision to make and the referee made it. The notion of a final warning so early in such a big game did not appear to enter Turpin’s thoughts.Simeone was incandescent and, moments later, after Héctor Bellerín had hacked at Lucas Hernández, the Atlético manager took his protests too far in demanding censure for the Arsenal right-back. His hackles had also been raised by Mesut Özil appearing to go to ground too easily in a separate incident. Simeone had demanded a yellow card for Özil. Banished to the stands, he paced about the back of the directors’s box – his face a mask of thunder.The atmosphere had crackled at the outset and Arsenal tore into Atlético. How the scoreline remained level at the interval was a mystery. Arsenal had created a fistful of chances by the midway point of the first half and they were clear ones, too.Lacazette had two of them before the sending-off. The first was a volley from Danny Welbeck’s cross, which he chopped down and watched it spin up and graze the outside of a post the second was a header from Nacho Monreal’s centre from which he extended Jan Oblak.Arsenal poured bodies forward against the 10 men. Welbeck bustled into the area to tee up Aaron Ramsey, whose shot was blocked by Diego Godín Wilshere headed tamely at Oblak Welbeck, having exchanged passes with Wilshere, shot at the goalkeeper from a tightish angle and Koscielny, in yards of space after Lacazette flicked on Granit Xhaka’s corner, stretched and sliced\u0026nbspwide.At the time it seemed imperative that Arsenal capitalised on their purple patch, but they did not. Apart from a miscued Monreal volley on 31 minutes, they rather ran out of steam before the interval. Lacazette was also guilty of making too much of a penalty area contact that he initiated in the 23rd minute.Atlético might have hurt Arsenal in the final part of the first half. Twice Griezmann drew saves out of David Ospina, the second after a powerful run by Thomas Partey.This Simeone team have proved a difficult nut to crack for many years and they had to rely on all their know-how with 10 men. Partey, the central midfielder, was moved to right-back Koke came inside from wide midfield and Griezmann switched to the flank. They worked tirelessly to compress the space between the lines. It became a test of Arsenal’s temperament as much as anything else.Wenger’s team continued to press in the second half, and they continued to probe, but the gaps they had enjoyed in the frantic opening no longer looked so pronounced. The manager stalked his technical area or rocked forward on the bench. The strain was clear.The breakthrough goal lanced the tension. Griezmann was guilty of trying to play out from the back and when Monreal tackled him, the home crowd sensed opportunity. Wilshere stood up a cross to the far post and Lacazette, having timed a towering leap, summoned power and direction in his downward header to beat Oblak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca1335753d8a7de4a83c8ad6783b402c2ee6757/0_95_2979_1788/master/2979.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86d6b893b17453931e6ca3269de029be","title":"fa sale wembley stadium shahid khan sign of the times","story":"Times change and the idea of an overseas billionaire taking over is now being seen as a workable solution to the FA’s money problemsThe Football Association’s proposed sale of Wembley stadium to the US car parts billionaire Shahid Khan was not greeted by a widespread shriek of patriotic indignation, perhaps illustrating how accustomed British people are now to crown jewels being sold overseas. Liverpool, thrillingly reconnecting with their European Cup-winning heritage and rampaging towards the Champions\u0026nbspLeague final, are owned by US sports franchise billionaires, as are Manchester United, Arsenal and other grand clubs including Fulham, which Khan, owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team, bought from Mohamed Al Fayed in\u0026nbsp2013.Fayed sold his other London landmark, Harrods, to Qatari state funds, which also owns the Shard and many prestigious chunks of the West End. The Premier League champions and large tracts of east Manchester are owned by the Abu Dhabi ruling family after decades in which no British investors could be found to arrest economic decline.At the same time, government investment in its own public responsibilities has been relentlessly cut, with sports facilities, swimming pools, public parks and playing fields inevitably falling victim. Before the 2010 general election, the then shadow Conservative sports minister, Hugh Robertson, expressed displeasure at a  article in which the Labour sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, proudly presented his government’s record of investment in school and public sports facilities and warned that the Tories would initiate cuts. Eight years on, as Sutcliffe predicted, hundreds of millions of pounds have been scythed from local authority budgets now struggling to maintain existing sports facilities, let alone modernise or build new ones.This is the context to the FA’s acknowledgement that it is considering a £500m-plus proposal from Khan to buy Wembley, and presenting it as a positive plan because it would spend the money on improving grassroots facilities. The new Wembley was built for £757m after serious financial difficulties, after the FA took ownership because its England matches and FA Cup semi-finals and finals provide the bulk of the income, and it has been a financial and administrative burden. Eleven years since the stadium finally reopened, with its new arch, 90,000 seats, Bobby Moore statue and girth of Club Wembley Club Wembley corporate feasting, the FA still owes £140m and Wembley makes a loss after paying the interest.The FA’s own history since it took charge of the Wembley project in 1999 has been turbulent, working through a series of chairmen and chief executives and repeatedly coming off worse in battles for governance authority with the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Scudamore. Gradually, however, the FA has focused more on the abject conditions in which the public has to play football and begun to explore the potential for improving\u0026nbspthings.Hence this proposed deal to sell Wembley and the FA’s careful presentation of it as an opportunity to release substantial, transformational money for public\u0026nbsp facilities.The argument is that having sweated for years to pay off the enormous debt on the new stadium, the FA has a prime asset in north London, still sucking in time and effort and whose value could be put to better use. If Khan, who has nursed a long-term project to bring the NFL and his Jaguars franchise more regularly to Wembley, were to buy it, the £500m-plus would be released for good works. This commitment at the outset of negotiations, that the bulk of the millions will go towards upgrading facilities, is the promise to which the FA must be held and against which it should be judged.The FA is making it clear it will still look to earn valuable money from playing matches at Wembley, retaining the Club Wembley receipts. In its most recently published accounts, for the year to 31 July 2016, the FA recorded £56.5m revenue from Club Wembley, 10-year packages having been sold to City firms and other corporate clients from the stadium’s opening. Last year Club Wembley packages were revamped to provide more luxury, reduce tenures to three seasons, and prices are now running from £2,148 for a seat per season to £11,064 in the One Twenty club and £37,200 – per person, per seat – in a private box.The FA is saying it will retain all this income and revert to playing matches on the basis it used to and on which most national teams do: pay rent to use the stadium and keep the money from the tickets. Khan will buy out the stadium itself, take the food and beverage revenue from the rest of it, and take on the burden of its\u0026nbspupkeep.The public money provided for Wembley’s rebuilding and the infrastructure around it: £79m from Sport England, £18m from the government, £17m from the London Development Agency and further smaller amounts making a total of £119m, will have to be repaid or an accommodation reached.For Khan, the attraction appears to be expanding the NFL into London and ensuring the Jaguars have pre-eminent rights to be the team who play there. While the NFL season is on, from September to January, the FA has accepted that England matches will not be played at Wembley and move around major club grounds instead, a prospect many fans are likely to welcome.During those months, traditionalists might avert their gaze from the goings-on within England’s national football stadium. But it is a sign of the times that the FA’s proposal itself is being entertained as a potentially workable idea to husband scarce resources, rather than dismissed with a cry of betrayal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961928244d4e3a256b2ac749e5b3c2814bfdc4a4/0_0_7225_4822/master/7225.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8b7dba380ccb16b45008da4452e6665","title":"arsenal v atletico madrid europa league semi final first leg live","story":"Atlético Madrid played with 10 men for 80 minutes, had six shots to Arsenal’s 28, were gifted a late goal and drewHere’s Arsène Wenger. Did that feel, he’s asked, like a defeat for his side?Yes. because I think, looking at the performance and the way the game went, it was the worst possible result for us. But we have to go there in a positive mood and qualify over there. Unfortunately we gave a goal away from nowhere. We have to recover from the disappointment and prepare for the next one.I think we could already be qualified tonight but it didn’t happen. Their goalkeeper made many saves. You see they have the quality up front, if you make a mistake they take advantage. For us, once we scored the 1-0 it was very important not to concede a goal. They couldn’t score with a combination, they could only score with a long ball. We have to look at ourselves.We know we can score anywhere. Let’s focus on that. What matters is that we go there with absolute belief to do it.A couple of Arsenal players have spoken. First, Alexandre Lacazette:And Danny Welbeck, who is not asked about his own contribution to Atletico’s equaliser:It’s disappointing. To take the lead and then to concede a goal right near the end, yeah, we’re disappointed with that. We’ll do a bit of analysis. We’ve got to make sure it doesn’t happen again. We’ve got to be positive. We’ve got a platform and we can build on top of that. There were opportunities there for us to score. It gives us a little bit of positivity going into the second leg, knowing we can create chances against a very good side.We know we can score against them. We did it tonight. We’re positive. We know we can create opportunities and hopefully put them in the back of the net.Finally, he’s asked about whether Wenger’s departure adds extra motivation:Going into a semi-final you don’t need any extra incentive. You want to get through to the final. We wanted to win before the manager announced he was leaving, and we want to win after as well. We’re professionals and that’s what we’re here to do.Marseille won the other game 2-0, with former Premier League players scoring both goals, and another in Dimitri Payet creating them.There is probably no team in world football that you’d less want to be play against when they’re down to 10 men than Atlético Madrid. And there can’t be many that you’d more want to play against when you’re down to 10 men than Arsenal.Arsenal dominated possession, but only because Atlético allowed them to. Because of the quality of the defending, and the number of defenders, and Arsenal’s fondness for over-elaboration, and a fundamental lack of quality, the home side created very little. Meanwhile the visitors barely even tried to attack, and even then half-heartedly – but they still scored.90+4 mins: The final whistle goes, and Wenger turns and heads straight down the tunnel.90+3 mins: It runs across goal to Xhaka, whose terrible shot loops high.90+3 mins: Thirty seconds to play, and Arsenal have a corner.90+2 mins: Özil crosses from the left, and Ramsey heads at goal again. This, though, is a much easier save for Oblak.90+1 mins: And so to stoppage time, of which there will be three minutes or so.89 mins: Everything about that goal was horrible for Arsenal. Koscielny had a chance to clear and hit the ball into his own face. Mustafi, trying to stop Griezmann knocking in the rebound, fell over. But Welbeck’s e, that was the worst of it.88 mins: Lacazette, who has played well, crosses, and Welbeck, stretching, heads over.87 mins: Oooh! A cross from the right, a fine header from Ramsey, and Oblak saves with his fingertips! “I know we’re not allowed to criticise the great man in his dotage, but this is the perfect summary of Wenger’s years in European competition,” writes David Hindle. “Pretty. At times ridiculously dominant. Utterly toothless. And out. Why would the script change in the end, after all?”85 mins: “This could be the most Arsenal Arsenal performance of all time,” says Hugh Molloy, as Torres replaces Griezmann.82 mins: The problem starts with Welbeck, who has the ball on the left, cuts inside and es in search of a free kick. Arsenal’s defence isn’t ready for this loss of possession, and one easy pass over the top sets Griezmann sprinting behind them and into space. Koscielny’s challenge is weak, and the Frenchman takes the ball on, shoots into Ospina, collects the rebound and scores! Griezmann has scored, and Arsenal’s advantage is dust!81 mins: Atlético are readying a final change, and it’s going to be Fernando Torres.79 mins: For the first time this half, Arsenal have a forward entirely unmarked inside the penalty area. He’s unmarked, though, because three defenders have converged on the man in possession, and Lacazette – for it is he – can’t find a way past them, leaving Welbeck frustrated.77 mins: At home, against 10 men for all but the first 10 minutes, and barely having to defend or even tackle for the entire second half, Arsenal should be trying to win the tie. “Anything less than 3-0 has got to be seen as a failure here,” suggests Hugh Molloy.75 mins: Another change for Atlético – Savic is on, and Correa is not.74 mins: A lengthy Arsenal move ends with Xhaka blasting a shot high from 25 yards.71 mins: Another corner is punched clear by Oblack. Arsenal swiftly work the ball back into the box, where Lacazette’s low shot is blocked.69 mins: Now they win a corner. Lacazette, level with the near post, heads across goal and just wide of the far, which is totally unprotected.69 mins: The Gunners are sniffing a second. Özil crosses from the right, Monreal heads back in from beyond the far post, and Giménez clears well.67 mins: Oooh! Lacazette sends the ball low across goal from right to left, but nobody has anticipated it and it runs away for a throw-in.66 mins: Meanwhile N’Jie has put Marseille two up against Red Bull Salzburg.65 mins: Atlético’s first change sees Gabi replace Gameiro.64 mins: Ozil turns nicely in the area and pulls the ball back, but a defender gets in the way. They’ve scored a goal! Inevitably, there’s a one-two in the build-up. It plays Wilshere into space on the left of the area but forces him wide. Still, he plays a lovely cross to the back post and Lacazette heads down and in!58 mins: From Welbeck’s left-wing cross the ball drops to Ramsey, four yards out. From that position you’d expect a goal nine times out of 10, but on this occasion the space between him and goal is entirely full of yellow shirts, so he doesn’t even shoot.56 mins: Atlético are playing 4-4-1, and the one – Gameiro – is standing 10 yards outside his penalty area.55 mins: Monreal’s low cross is kicked clear, he wins it back and then his high cross is headed clear. “Few teams can have a sustained spell of possession in the opposition penalty area and not look like scoring the way Arsenal can,” notes Dave Seare.53 mins: Ramsey’s 20-yarder presents Oblak with an easy save. Arsenal don’t seem to have any particular plan to break down this defence, so will just keep on running to the edge of the area and then trying a one-two until one of them falls over.51 mins: Hernandez runs past Xhaka and goes down, and the two players put their heads together angrily afterwards. Hernandez was brushed by Xhaka’s hand, but then carried on for a few strides before flinging himself to the floor. The referee tells them both to grow up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2fccf2278a3c3a7cff07d403bafd00c4e25626f/603_581_3553_2132/master/3553.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24a978b717bdb19ea60fb40c1f133166","title":"is it weird to eat the same sandwich for lunch every day","story":"Housing minister Dominic Raab’s food habits have sparked debate, but surveys show UK workers are repetitive eatersDid you eat the same thing for today’s lunch at work that you ate yesterday? We ask because a detail about sandwiches was one of the odder elements of a story about a Westminster security alert. A woman accused of meeting men via a “sugar daddy” website while working for parliament told the Daily Mirror that the housing minister, Dominic Raab, has exactly the same thing for lunch every day: a Pret a Manger chicken caesar and bacon baguette, with a pot of fruit and the same smoothie.But is this really that unusual?The statistics we have on how people choose to eat lunch at work are usually gathered by surveys, which can be unreliable, but all the indicators are that a significant proportion of the UK workforce eat the same thing for lunch every day. Whole Foods Market carried out a similar exercise four years earlier. It found that a third of Britons ate the same lunch daily, and half said they had been doing so for six years. Cheese sandwiches and ham sandwiches are apparently the favourites of a nation stuck in a lunchtime rut.There are upsides to repetitive eating. There’s a theory that because you become subconsciously bored of the meal, you eat smaller portions as a result. It can also help with budgeting: those purchasing the same thing each day can anticipate exactly how much they are going to spend on lunches. Another reason to stick to what you know might be to do with allergies – repeatedly ordering the same thing avoids the risk of unexpected ingredients. This may not be the case with Raab’s sandwich, however, since it contains seven items listed by Pret as possible allergens: gluten, sesame seeds, dairy, egg, celery, mustard and fish.Still, regardless of what you have for lunch at work, your habits will never be as eyebrow-raising as the man who claims he eats Christmas dinner every single day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8908436488bf99f8f3659b3ecfc42a57d3626829/892_1454_6214_3728/master/6214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=704f47910abfed3ef413be0dbe1a98c0","title":"no stir risotto recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"Think risotto is all about endless stirring? Think again…I’m going to let you in on a little secret: despite what every nonna and Italian cookbook will tell you, you don’t need to chain yourself to the hob to make a decent risotto. The method below, which involves a mere two minutes of stirring, comes from a fourth-generation rice grower from the Veneto. And if it’s good enough for him …125ml white wine550ml stock3 tbsp butter ½ onion, peeled and chopped200g risotto rice, carnaroli or vialone nano ideally, though arborio will do25g parmesan, gratedBring the wine and 400ml of the stock to a simmer (chicken or vegetable are the most versatile, but ham, fish or beef may work better, depending on your choice of ingredients: if you’re using a stock pot or cube, which can be salty, taste and dilute as necessary before use). Red wine is sometimes used for risottos featuring beef or sausages.Over a medium-low heat, melt two tablespoons of the butter in a wide, shallow pan for which you have a lid (a wide pan means that more of the rice will come into contact with the stock, so it will cook more evenly). If you’re making a seafood risotto, or would simply prefer to keep the dish dairy-free, use extra-virgin olive oil instead.Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring, until it’s soft and golden make sure it doesn’t brown. Depending on what kind of risotto you’re making, once the onion has begun to soften, you could also chuck in finely chopped garlic, carrot, celery or pancetta, but leave any fresh herbs and other delicate ingredients until the end.Turn up the heat slightly and tip in the rice. Stir to coat with the butter and fry until it’s hot to the touch, without letting it colour. Use arborio rice, if that’s all you can find, but carnaroli and vialone nano are starchier, more robust varieties that are harder to overcook, so will produce a creamier result.Pour in the hot stock and wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan and leave to cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes – a good time for the cook to pour a glass of wine and put your feet up: once you’ve warmed the remaining stock, cut the rest of the butter into pieces and grated the cheese, that is.After 15 minutes, the rice should be almost tender, with just a hint of bite, and have absorbed all the cooking liquid. Add the butter (or oil) and the remaining 150ml stock to the pan, then stir for a couple of minutes, until the risotto is creamy but the consistency is still fairly loose.Stir in the grated parmesan (or pecorino, or any hard, dry cheese, or leave it out altogether, if you prefer, or if you’re making a seafood risotto). Either way, turn off the heat, cover the pan again and leave to sit for two minutes, then season to taste (a touch of nutmeg works well) and serve.This basic risotto is delicious on its own, or with cooked veg stirred through it (I had mine with wilted spinach and baked squash), but it’s easy to adapt. A classic Milanese risotto, say, is made with beef stock and a good pinch of saffron (add it to the final 150ml stock as it warms) and served alongside osso buco.Mushroom risotto can be made along the same lines, with meat or vegetable stock and the soaking liquid from dried porcini. As can, in just a few weeks’ time, asparagus risotto made with vegetable or chicken stock and a glug of asparagus cooking water. Note that fragile ingredients such as asparagus or seafood are best cooked separately and stirred into the risotto just before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b98bd312c8c104cb5030c3c2a8491b819f74b3d/0_515_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a985ce653f8c803f8c3acdf936bdd34d","title":"brockhampton 14 boyband men colour rap sing gay pop","story":"Most of them are men of colour – and many of their songs address being gay – but that’s not the only way these millennial sensations are reinventing the boybandAmerica’s best new boyband is crammed, 13 deep, into the green room backstage at Chicago’s House of Blues. The sprawling collective known as Brockhampton (minus photographer Ashlan Grey) is preparing for the first of two nights of shows at the 1,800-capacity venue, on the tail end of their almost entirely sold out Love Your Parents tour. Four years ago, its members dropped out of their respective normal lives to move to San Marcos, Texas, where they slept on the floor in unfurnished apartments and spent every waking minute on art. Forget the corporate gloss of traditional boyband fare instead, their songs are a giddy blend of kick-in-the-door raps, sunny-day soul, lighters-in-the-sky pop melodies and skate-punk energy.By typical standards, their work has been paying off – and then some. Last year, the group released not just their debut album, but their second and third, too the third, December’s Saturation III, debuted at No 15 on the US Billboard albums chart. There’s also Billy Star, a feature-length film with original music (the 22-minute trailer is available to stream), along with American Boyband, an eight-episode documentary-style TV series on Viceland. But Kevin Abstract, the group’s de facto leader, isn’t satisfied – not yet.“We were raised differently, and I’m not even necessarily talking about our parents,” he says. The 21-year-old is soft-spoken but intense, radiating passion without raising his voice. “We were obsessed with Kanye West and people who obsess over the shit that they do, it made us the same way. We want to leave a mark, you know? I want people to look back like: Damn, Brockhampton did all of that in a very short amount of time and inspired so many people. I want …” He pauses, trying to consolidate his and his 13 best friends’ ambitions into a cohesive thought. “Fuck! I just want this shit to be so great. I’ve been frustrated lately because I want to be so great.”Reminding him and the crew of an abbreviated list of their recent accomplishments only stokes the embers. “I’m 21 Michael Jackson was 23 when he made Thriller,” Abstract replies, matter-of-fact. When I suggest that a guy who had had to perform since he was six years old might not be the most viable standard for comparison, the room erupts into a vehement chorus of “Why not?!” from all sides.“People want to coddle you and be like: ‘Oh, no, don’t hold yourself to that standard’ – but why?” asks Ameer Vann, the deep-voiced 21-year-old rapper who met Abstract in high school outside Houston, Texas. “Why wouldn’t I want to be Michael? Why wouldn’t I want to be 23 on the cover of Thriller?”“Tupac died when he was 25!” exclaims Romil Hemnani, a 22-year-old originally from Connecticut who is one of the group’s producers. “He was only 25 and he accomplished all that!”“And you know what else we have to remind each other of, even in the bigger sense of things?” adds Henock Sileshi – better known as HK – who is 23 and serves as Brockhampton’s self-taught creative director. “Trayvon Martin died when he was 17. Who is to say Ameer can’t get pulled over and something happens? We still operate in this world.”If Brockhampton make you reassess everything you thought a boyband could be, things are going according to plan. While the crew lead with the music, they double as a self-sufficient creative agency. Alongside the singers, rappers and producers in their 14-man roster are designers, photographers and web developers (such as Robert Ontenient, who joined as a producer but taught himself code from scratch when the group needed a webmaster). There aren’t many, or perhaps any other boybands producing and mixing their own records, shooting and directing their own music videos, designing their own merch and stage sets. And there aren’t many boybands who look like Brockhampton – the majority of its members are men of colour – or whose lyrics reference giving guys head and coming out to their parents. In Junky, Abstract spells it out: “Why you always rap about being gay? ’Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay.”And though cheeky One Direction references are scattered throughout the Saturation trilogy – “I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry,” Vann raps on Boys – Brockhampton don’t sound much like familiar boybands. They rap as often as they sing they idolise Kanye, Wu-Tang Clan, Souls of Mischief and Odd Future, and it shows. In 2018, strict ideas about genre isions are about as relevant as cassette players, and rap’s influence bleeds into just about everything else. In other words, it’s not like hip-hop is not weird enough to accommodate an act such as Brockhampton, if that’s how they wanted to play it. But for Abstract and company, introducing Brockhampton as a boyband in a world that sees men of colour on a stage and automatically thinks “rap crew” was not a decision it was simply what they were. “We’re boys in a band. Right?” asks Vann.“You’ll see publications being like, ‘self-proclaimed boyband’, or put ‘boyband’ in quotes. But why can’t we be that?” Hemnani asks. “The American idea of a boyband is, like, five straight, conventionally attractive white dudes. I come from a south Asian background, and I’m not supposed to be doing any of this. I’m supposed to be a doctor, or work at 7-Eleven, or be an engineer. So, even beyond the boyband thing, doing something out of the norm for my culture in general is big to me.”“The whole point is to redefine it,” Abstract says. “So that a group of kids who look more like us and less like One Direction could be like: ‘I want to be in a boyband. I’m-a do that.’” Specifically, the group likes to use the phrase “all-American boyband” – a phrase that feels especially striking at a time when the surface-level wokeness of US pop culture might lead one to believe that the country is much more socially progressive than it is. Dom McLennon, a 25-year-old rapper who started making beats when he was 11, doesn’t see this framing as optimistic or pessimistic so much as honest. “This is the most all-American shit you could come up with,” he says. “It’s not a positive or negative thing. America’s not a beautiful place. I’m three generations removed from slavery. I don’t have a good history here. But there’s no reason I can’t make one for myself right now.”“NWA was all-American Wu-Tang was all-American,” adds Abstract. “It was just a part of America you may not have seen at the time. And I feel like a Merlyn Wood verse, or an Ameer Vann verse, or Dom – their perspective is just as American as the white kids I went to school with who shot guns and killed animals on the weekends. We’re darker than other boybands and we suck dick, but we’re still very American.” He lets the sentiment sink in for a beat. “You should try to make that the headline.”A few hours later, the crew takes the stage to the swell of the Backstreet Boys’ I Want It That Way the overwhelmingly teenage crowd shouts along to the pop anthem probably released around the time they were born. There are wild screams and chants of “Fuck Pitchfork!” – a trope that’s become a crowd staple at their recent shows, referring to the music website – as Brockhampton explode into Boogie, a euphoric, moshpit-inducing funk banger. On the chorus, Abstract sings: “I’ve been beat up my whole life  I’ve been shot down, kicked out twice  Ain’t no stopping me tonight.” Close your eyes, listen to the crowd’s deafening noise, and you could mistake it for a One Direction reunion show.The next day, the group has planned the tour’s sole meet-and-greet at RSVP Gallery, a streetwear boutique in Wicker Park, Chicago, co-owned by Virgil Abloh of Louis Vuitton. Two hours before it’s scheduled to start, there’s already a queue stretching four blocks. The crowd is almost entirely teens, as erse as Brockhampton’s members themselves Estrella, 20, and Kendall, 19, at the front, have been waiting since 6am – almost nine hours. “There are other bands that have representation, but it’s not like Brockhampton,” says 17-year-old Miracle. “As a black person, seeing other people of colour who are unapologetically themselves, speaking on things like being gay …” “And mental illness, too,” adds her friend Micquela, who is 16. We’re interrupted by Brockhampton members beginning to arrive, and the street goes nuts. “Yo, that’s Ameer!” “Jabari, we love you!” “HK, you look cute today!” The friends laugh as they politely apologise for screaming – it’s just that they have never had musical heroes like this before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8614eb579cdc005a29ba723e302f0922f45ce82/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f2ce1830feeae5c428882159608cd68 720w","title":"cabinets brexiters push theresa may to drop customs partnership","story":"Boris Johnson among those who fear option would allow Britain to rejoin the customs union Theresa May’s Brexit inner cabinet are preparing for a showdown over the customs union next week, as leading Brexiters including Liam Fox and David Davis try to force the prime minister to ditch the “customs partnership” model.This so-called “hybrid model”, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, is regarded as cumbersome and impractical by Brexiters, who fear it would leave open the option that Britain could rejoin a customs union. It would also require the UK to access EU IT systems to levy duties, something Brussels is unlikely to accept. “The hybrid model is the unicorn model”, one senior Brexiter said.The group, backed by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, hopes to persuade the prime minister to throw her weight behind the alternative, the maximum facilitation (“max-fac”) proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks.The customs union has become the most contentious issue in the debate about what kind of Brexit should be pursued, with many MPs regarding it as the only way of successfully avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. Countries in the customs union levy tariffs on goods made outside the EU, but member countries trade with each other tariff-free and negotiate trade deals as a bloc. It is this “common commercial policy” that Brexiters are particularly exercised about, since it would prevent Britain from striking the sort of independent deals with non-EU countries that Fox, the international trade secretary, is pursuing.The government’s options have initially been rejected by Brussels negotiators, though Davis has insisted his team is ready to answer the EU27’s concerns.Leavers hope the Brexit inner cabinet will decide which of the two customs union options the government will adopt when it meets next week. The decision could then be ratified by the full cabinet, but proponents of the hybrid model are likely to try to keep it on the table.On Thursday, cabinet Brexiters were alarmed by comments from the home secretary, Amber Rudd, which appeared to leave open the possibility of remaining in the customs union.As MPs debated the issue in the House of Commons, Rudd was asked whether she would vote to remain inside if she were still a backbencher. “I am committed to the government’s position, which, to some extent, we are still working on,” she replied.Pressed on whether she thought it was more or less likely that the UK would stay in the customs union, Rudd said: “I’m afraid I’m not going to be drawn on that we still have a few discussions to have, in a really positive, consensual, easy way, among all my cabinet colleagues, in order to arrive at a final position”.One Whitehall source said: “Everyone knows where Rudd stands: there is a large part of the cabinet who see Brexit as a damage limitation exercise – and if they win the customs union battle, they will move on to the single market”.The home secretary quickly retreated, tweeting an hour after the lunch ended that she “could have been clearer” and “of course” the UK would leave the customs union.May’s spokesman later said: “It’s the position of the prime minister, the cabinet and the entire government that we will be leaving the customs union and be free to sign our own trade deals around the world.”But as a series of Conservative MPs stood up in the debate to express concerns about leaving the customs union, Rudd’s comments appeared to suggest the issue remains unresolved at the highest level of government.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “Amber Rudd appears to have let slip that discussions around the cabinet table about negotiating a customs union with the EU have not in fact concluded.“If that is so, then the prime minister should rethink her approach and listen to the growing chorus of voices in parliament and in business that believe she has got it wrong on a customs union.”The former education secretary Nicky Morgan warned the Conservatives against putting economic growth at risk: “This country is being asked to experiment at other people’s pleasure with a free trade policy when we do not know what the costs will be for constituents and businesses in this country.“And I say to my party – if we undermine and ignore the evidence for peace in Northern Ireland, and we undermine the business and financial security of people in this country, we will not be forgiven for a generation.”The debate has no direct influence on government policy, but was regarded as a gauge of Commons opinion before potentially crucial future votes on amendments to the customs and trade bills committing the government to trying to negotiate a new customs union.Some Brexiters are keen for May to force the issue to a vote in parliament, blaming the delay on over-cautious whips. One said that the chief whip, Julian Smith, was reticent to hold a vote too soon as “he doesn’t want to lose a career-ending vote”.They suggested that the government would, instead, wait until it was in a stronger position once the Brexit white paper had been published, the local elections were out of the way and they could see how May’s poll ratings were holding up.A senior Tory source acknowledged there would be some Tory remainers who would never be won over. “You could promise them free sex and chocolate and they still wouldn’t vote for Brexit.”No 10 said there was “a discussion around the issue of which two customs options the government opts for – but are we leaving the customs union? The answer is categorically yes.”Both options set out in May’s Mansion House speech in March were still on the table, the spokesman said. “But as we move forward, you can expect there to be a single option,” he said. “Neither of the options are a customs union.”Asked about next week’s Brexit war cabinet, he said: “The strategy and negotiations committee is the government’s steering group in relation to Brexit. I won’t discuss that committee in advance.” understands that a white paper setting out the government’s negotiating position for the future economic partnership will be published next month in a bid to unblock talks in Brussels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf8b994cd1b04311e62678d39ce9b6f33f196b6/0_3_5102_3061/master/5102.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f429f5f3b3e18d8f621b4c31032f9ac","title":"eoin morgan not dreaming england world cup","story":"Eoin Morgan will not allow himself to visualise lifting the World Cup at Lord’s next summer but believes his England team will definitely be among the contenders if they continue their current improvement.Fixtures for the 2019 tournament were announced on Thursday, with England’s campaign in the all-play-all, 10-team group stage starting against South Africa at the Oval on 30\u0026nbspMay and playing at nine of the 11 host venues overall.Morgan’s side have risen to No\u0026nbsp3 in the ODI rankings after six consecutive series wins and have just enjoyed one of their best winters, with victories in Australia and New Zealand. But although confidence is high over the chances of breaking their duck at a 50-over global event, the captain will not get carried away.“No, not at all,” Morgan replied when asked if he has imagined himself with the trophy come the end of the Lord’s final on 14\u0026nbspJuly. “We were in the final of the World T20 in Kolkata two years ago and despite playing great cricket up to that point, things can go against you.“We’ll definitely give it a good crack.

Even so early in this season, that much is abundantly clear.St Helens have not been short of outstanding Australian recruits down the years with the likes of Mal Meninga and, more recently, Jamie Lyon representing one of the game’s most famous clubs with real distinction. But Barba’s position among that company appears to be more and more likely as the season progresses, with this latest masterclass only tempered by a shoulder injury which led to the full-back being withdrawn with seven minutes remaining. By then, though, the job had long since been done.His first hat-trick as a St Helens player – which already lifts his try tally to 15 for the season – told only half the story, as Barba not only further underlined the Saints’ position as title favourites but surely shortened his own odds for the Man of Steel award once again.It did not take long for the visitors to settle into their groove. In all, there were six St\u0026nbspHelens tries in an eventful first half, the deadlock being broken as early as the fourth minute when Tommy Makinson finished a magnificent move in the corner.Makinson was involved in the Saints’ second try, as his stunning high take laid the platform for Dominique Peyroux to cross and as the half wore on Barba’s influence grew.The mercurial Australian scored their third try as he finished a break from the wing Regan Grace before rounding his opposite number, Niall Evalds, to make it 16-0. Barba’s kick heaped more pressure on the hosts and two minutes later his inch‑perfect pass enabled Ryan Morgan to touch down for their fourth try.At that point, 22-0 down, it would have perhaps been easy for Salford to surrender. To their credit, though, they fought back well and scored the next try when Tyrone McCarthy exploited a rare moment of weakness from Barba. With the goal by Jake Shorrocks the home side were on the board, 22-6.Salford continued to exert more and more pressure on the Saints’ line but, just as they looked set to strike again, Barba struck with a moment of magic. The Australian plucked a Salford pass from midair before racing the length of the field, and once again put the visitors in complete control.There was a moment of controversy four minutes before half-time, when the St\u0026nbspHelens forward Matty Lees was dismissed for a dangerous tackle on Evalds – but the visitors made light of that setback just before the break when Grace crossed for their sixth try. At that stage, even with a man advantage, there looked to be no way back for the hosts.And that matter was emphasised shortly after the break when, predictably, Barba was involved again as he ghosted through a line and fed Grace, before Lomax and Mark Percival combined for the centre to score. Barba then completed his own hat-trick before Theo Fages rounded off the scoring in the final moments.Before that Fages try, though – and worryingly for the visitors – Barba landed awkwardly while attempting another outrageous offload. This time, he would not get back up – the only blot on another outstanding night for both the Super League leaders and the full-back himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02950cad596903a3e78e03fe6c03328c2cd4d680/0_246_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f5a93b671c08bc7229c06f7a0506741","title":"toro beauty and the bull review","story":"Lillian Baylis theatre, LondonCarlos Pons Guerra’s production for DeNada Dance Theatre is a lurid mix of melodrama and showmanshipYoung Spanish-born choreographer Carlos Pons Guerra has been forging a distinctive style that – to borrow the title of one of his own works – might be dubbed “ham and passion”: a lurid mix of melodrama, eroticism, iconoclasm and showmanship.With two acts, six dancers and an extended playlist of Latin music from mariachi marches to Cuban torch songs and Spanish orchestral fantasias, Toro: Beauty and the Bull is Guerra’s most ambitious work yet. DeNada Dance Theatre’s production opens with Beauty (Emma Louise Walker) lying inert on a bordello floor with her legs spread. The beasts of the story are four men who brace their arms like stags locking horns, or face each other off with cockfight struts. Awoken, Beauty struggles but fails to escape, until she encounters an altogether different beast: the fabulous Marivi da Silva as the Bull, flamenco-skirted, her breasts in straps and horns upon her head. This mythic creature comes to represent a different, fantastical alternative: a mix of power, tenderness and passionate sensuality. No wonder Beauty falls for the Bull and no wonder the beasts hound them.For all its emotive imagery and heightened conflict, the first act feels laboured. The setup is schematic, the musical playlist keeps chopping into the action, and too often the choreography fills out the music instead of motivating it.Act two sees both piece and performers shift into gear. The male dancers, now costumed like the Bull in horns, harnesses and skirts, perform as “dragimals” – flamboyant, chimerical creatures who mix Swan Lake arms with showtime shimmies, Mata Hari exoticism with King Kong voodoo. It’s all deliriously inauthentic, and segues into a polymorphously perverse love-in of unbound eroticism. For Beauty, this looks like heaven. But the men return as circus ringmasters, de-horning the Bull, forcing Beauty into a bridal gown and tethering her to net curtains. The music comes to a melodramatic climax and so, pelvises pumping, do the guys.Subtlety be damned! That’s fine – but sometimes the piece feels more driven by Guerra’s ideas than his characters. When those characters do come to life, though, they can set the stage alight. Da Silva – strong, wild, fearless – is dynamite throughout.

Here’s what he and they had to sayMike Schroepfer may not have been Mark Zuckerberg, but Facebook’s chief technology officer was nevertheless forced to admit in front of MPs that the company had made errors in its handling of the Cambridge Analytica data breach, faced questions over what the company had not told MPs in a previous hearing, and apologised for threatening the  with legal action.Here are the five main points from his appearance before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee:1. Facebook missed opportunities to prevent and then deal appropriately with the data breach at the time. Schroepfer acknowledged that nobody at Facebook had read the terms and conditions behind Aleksander Kogan’s data harvesting questionnaire when he proposed it in 2014. The company only found out about the breach in late 2015 after the  first reported that Kogan’s data had been shared with Cambridge Analytica. Schroepfer said that Facebook had demanded that the 87m records collected were deleted, but the breach was not reported to regulators. “It was a mistake not to inform people at the time,” Schroepfer was forced to concede.2. Facebook “lacked integrity” because it failed to tell MPs the extent of the data breach at a previous hearing in February. Ian Lucas, a Labour MP, relentlessly pressed Schroepfer as to why company executives had not admitted what Facebook knew about the data breach when they gave evidence to the committee in February. Schroepfer struggled to explain, saying: “A lot of this has come to light in sharp relief for us in the last month.” Lucas was very critical: “I remain unconvinced the company has integrity.” The MP then asked what Mark Zuckerberg knew at the time and whether he would give evidence. “I will report back,” Schroepfer said.3. It was wrong for Facebook to threaten legal action against the  as an article about the Cambridge Analytica data breach was close to publication. Julian Knight, a Conservative MP and former journalist, demanded that Schroepfer apologise for “this bullying tactic”. The Facebook executive left MPs incredulous as he said “my understanding is that this is common practice in the UK”. When pressed by Knight again, Schroepfer finally apologised: “I am sorry that journalists feel we are attempting to prevent the truth coming out.”4. Facebook said leave campaigners had spent $2m on digital adverts during the referendum campaign. The money was spent by Aggregate IQ, the Canadian data company used by Vote Leave and other pro-Brexit campaigns, although the figure disclosed was noticeably lower than the £3.5m that pro-Brexit campaigns told the Electoral Commission they had spent with the same firm. There was no discussion about why the sums differed. 5. Official inquiries are ongoing. Schroepfer said he had met the information commissioner this week, and that the company had provided information to the Electoral Commission. He was then pressed on why Facebook executives were in Cambridge Analytica’s office at the time the data breach revelations emerged. Knight asked if Facebook was “perverting the course of justice”. Schroepfer said: “As soon as the information commissioner asked us to stand down, we said of course your investigation takes precedence.” The company also unveiled plans to label political ads, and who has paid for them, before May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a292a09b2bf9f66c0577e8c5b5e371b7d33d2b/159_0_2785_1673/master/2785.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2862d0b8497dc525a2568b36df5af206","title":"snapchat new spectacles launch","story":"Only 220,000 units of wearable gadget were sold first time around, with the tech firm writing off $40m in the processSnap is doubling down on its hardware business, launching a new version of its Spectacles camera-glasses today with a better camera, the ability to take still images and water resistance.The new model comes as Snapchat attempts to recover from the disappointing long-term fate of the first generation, which gathered attention – and long queues – when they were launched in extremely limited quantities in November 2016, but failed to sell in large numbers when they were eventually released on general sale. Over the lifetime of the product, Snap sold just 220,000 units, the company says, eventually writing off unsold inventory worth almost $40m.This time round, the new Spectacles will be available from Snap’s website, at a price of £149.99, and are launching simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and France, and more widely across Europe the following week.Snap’s decision to recommit to Spectacles has come as a surprise, as many competitors are shifting away from smart glasses in general. Intel launched its own product, a pair of specs that use lasers to shine information directly into wearers’ eyes, in February this year, but had cancelled the project by April, noting that new technologies “sometimes require tough choices when market dynamics don’t support further investment”. Similarly, the Google Glass smart spectacles, launched in 2013, famously earned its wearers the sobriquet “Glasshole”, and the company eventually stopped producing the device in 2015.Snap says the focus on hardware is a critical part of its future.

Pashinyan said on Wednesday he had received assurances from Russian officials that Moscow would not intervene in the crisis, ruling out a scenario similar to Russia’s intervention in eastern Ukraine. Armenia’s foreign minister, Edward Nalbandian, was in Moscow on Thursday for talks.Pashinyan has said the movement “has no geopolitical context”, and that the revolution that booted out the country’s government was neither pro-western, nor pro-Russian."},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows collision on wellington quay in dublin","story":"  April 24, 2018Garda\u0026iacute pin driver to ground after car hits several vehicles in multiple incidents "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former Anglo chief David Drumm denies defrauding investors and false accountingAnti-abortion group launches online petition calling on chairman to step down from roleDubliner Marie Collins played major role in pope\u0026rsquos admission of error in disbelieving victims\u0026euro70,000 was stolen during recession when employees at Cork haulage company were taking pay cutsSimon Coveney says spending to combat world hunger \u0026lsquorooted in our own experiences\u0026rsquoScheme now expected to cost Government more than \u0026euro40 million in full yearDelaying tactics are costing lives, RSA chairwoman Liz O\u0026rsquoDonnell claimsMattie McGrath claims \u0026euro10m spent on psychological services but \u0026euro400m on medicationSixteen journalism students from across Ireland awarded at annual awardsEamon Ryan criticises Government for being \u0026lsquoall at sea\u0026rsquo on single-use plastic wasteRegeneration group puts forward \u0026euro56m \u0026lsquocost rental\u0026rsquo scheme for former flats in InchicoreTaoiseach makes case for integration on several issues but reiterates resistance on taxGreece asked Ireland to recover penalty from trucker wrongly convicted of smugglingLack of political will \u0026lsquocondemning Irish nature to loss and decline\u0026rsquo, NGOs warnJudge warns man not to threaten him during fraught proceedings over repossession of houseCompany follows Panda and City Bin in introducing charge, which it expects to be \u0026euro20 a year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475659.1524765262!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk s red lines only barrier to close ties with eu says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘The threat on our doorstep today is Brexit.’ File photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersIreland’s and the EU’s relationship with the UK needs to continue to be “close, comprehensive and ambitious”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has told students in Belgium. “I believe the only barrier to achieving this is the United Kingdom’s own red lines.

He emphasised the Government’s determination to defend the gains of the Northern Irish peace process and the Belfast Agreement “in all its parts, and all that flows from it peace, powersharing and NorthSouth co-operation.” “It is why we have insisted that there can be no hardening of the Border on our island: no new barriers to the movement of people or to trade.”He also made a case for the defence for programmes such as the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and cohesion funding, and expanding into new areas such as migration and research and extending the Erasmus student programme. “I support calls for the establishment of a common asylum policy and system, to replace the current one which is clearly not working. A small number of countries are shouldering the responsibility of providing refugees with a fresh start in Europe,” he said. Mr Varadkar affirmed Ireland’s commitment to supporting European security and engaging with the new EU defence framework, Pesco and to fulfilling “the promise of the single market – for example, in insurance, mortgages and loans – so that people can get cheaper loans from European lenders and insurers if necessary”. As EU finance ministers gather in Sofia, Bulgaria, for a first round of discussions on new European Commission plans to tax the digital economy, Mr Varadkar insisted “we should not accept a situation where large corporations can avoid paying any taxes anywhere”. But, putting down a clear marker that Ireland’s position on tax is not about to waver, he insisted “decisions on national budgets and the taxation that funds these budgets should be determined by national parliaments and governments”.“Issues such as climate change, cybersecurity, mass migration, international trade, and the regulation of major corporations are transnational, and cannot be solved by 28 countries coming up with 28 different solutions. We need to think and act together,” he said.Warning of the “dangers of populism, nationalism and anti-politics”, Mr Varadkar quoted the Bulgarian writer Ivan Krastev.“In his recent book: After Europe, he observed that: ‘Tolerance and civility were long the defining characteristics of the European Union’ but that ‘today they are often perceived as the EU’s core vulnerabilities.’” Mr Varadkar added: “Those who try to entice Europeans down the pathway of populism and nationalism offer a dark and desperate future, and they know it. “I am utterly and unshakably convinced,” he said, “that the European Union offers something else. It provides the light to their darkness. Antidote to their poison.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475764.1524772585!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former tory ministers back uk staying in eu customs union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative support for remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit indicates the strength of a growing rebellion on prime minister Theresa May’s backbenches. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesA number of former Conservative ministers have voiced support for remaining in a customs union with the European Union after Brexit during a parliamentary debate that showed the strength of a growing rebellion on Theresa May’s backbenches.Conservatives abstained on the non-binding motion in favour of customs union membership but pro-European Tories joined opposition MPs to speak in favour of it.Former attorney general Dominic Grieve accused the government of adopting a blundering approach to Brexit which ignored the reality that new trade deals outside the EU could not compensate for the loss of single-market and customs-union membership.“Why is it that the deputy ambassador of Japan has us all in and says: ‘You do realise that every Japanese company will be gone in 10 years’ time if they cannot have frictionless trade into the European Union?’ We are behaving in the most extraordinary and blinded fashion as we blunder around ignoring the realities. And, in any case, free-trade agreements come with strings attached,” he said.“If you have a free-trade agreement, if you have multiple free-trade agreements, they will very quickly start to look like customs unions. That’s what happens when people get together. So this ‘customs union bad, somehow free-trade agreement good’ simply does not stack up. It is time for a reality check. In fact, we need more than a customs union because, as is also clearly obvious, we are not going to be able to trade without regulatory alignment.”George Freeman, Ms May’s former policy chief, said many of his constituents who voted Leave said they were happy with the single market but objected to a political union. Luke Graham, a Conservative MP who won his seat in Ochil and South Perthshire last year, rejected the accusation that remaining in a customs union was a betrayal of the Brexit vote.“None of our constituents voted to be poorer. None of our constituents wanted to have more barriers between ourselves and our international trading partners. We don’t mind the labels, we don’t mind the mechanism, but I know from my constituents they want to be able to have a customs system that they can rely on, that respects the United Kingdom’s integrity, but also allows them to prosper and be better off than they are today,” he said.Conservative Brexiteer Hugo Swire said remaining in the customs union made no sense at a time when the EU’s share of global trade was shrinking. He said leaving it was a necessary step to restoring Britain’s global trading role.“The government have set out to ensure that we are a truly global Britain. As we have heard, remaining inside a customs union with the EU would prevent the UK from committing to that agenda and striking lucrative free-trade agreements with countries across the world,” he said.Veteran pro-European Conservative Ken Clarke poured scorn on the idea that lucrative new trade deals awaited Britain once it leaves the EU.“The idea that some marvellous new global future with fantastic new trade deals is about to open up is hopeless. If someone can get the Americans to open up their public procurement to international competition and give up the ‘Buy America’ policy or to open the regulatory barriers that they have put in the way of professional and financial services, they will be a miraculous negotiator, because we could get nowhere when Obama was in power. I do not think that the present administration are offering us anything they just want their beef to come here,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

around world miss life saving vaccines","story":"A health worker gives a polio vaccine to a girl in Lahore, PakistanMore than one in 10 children around the world miss out on basic life-saving vaccinations, according to figures released by the World Health Organization.To mark World Immunisation Week, running from April 24 to April 28, WHO is highlighting the importance of vaccines but is also warning that a large number of children do not receive any vaccinations at all.An estimated 19.5m children missed out on the basic diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis – or whooping cough – (DTP) vaccine in 2016, estimates WHO.Despite efforts to boost vaccination rates over the past decade progress has stalled and just 86 per cent of infants worldwide – 116.5m – received the basic DTP vaccine. WHO says that between two and three million lives are saved every year through the DTP vaccine but an additional 1.5million deaths could be avoided if coverage improved. About 60 per cent of the children missing out on these life-saving vaccines live in just 10 countries.WHO recommends that all children should be given the following vaccines: BCG where there are high rates of tuberculosis hepatitis B polio DTP Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumococcal disease rotavirus measles and rubella.It also recommends that adolescent girls are vaccinated against the human papilloma virus to protect them from contracting cervical cancer. And some vaccines, such as yellow fever, are recommended for particular regions. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}However, poor vaccine coverage is not just a problem in developing countries. Latest data from WHO shows that in Europe there were 21,000 cases of measles in 2017, compared to 5,000 the previous year.And this was partly due to a decline in the number of people vaccinated as well as a shortage in the supply of vaccines and poor disease surveillance, said WHO.The largest outbreaks of the disease were in Romania, where there were 5,562 cases and Italy, where there were 5,006 cases. In Germany there were 927 cases and the disease and in the UK there were 282. WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2011 with a goal to preventing millions of deaths but some key targets are off track.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016For example, 40 priority countries should have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by 2015 but only 18 countries have met this goal. And by 2016 at least four WHO world regions should have eliminated measles – only one, the WHO region of the Americas, has achieved this. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said World Immunisation Week, was an opportunity \u0026quotto remind everyone of the incredible value of vaccines\u0026quot.\u0026quotYes, vaccines work, vaccines prevent disease, vaccines save lives,\u0026quot he said. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Nicola Sturgeon \u0026#39dancing on the head of a pin\u0026#39 to avoid Brexit Bill deal\u0026#39Why did you drop bombs on another country?\u0026#39 Children grill White House press secretary Sarah Sanders Primary school plans to close at lunchtime on Fridays to give teachers more spare timePictures released of Kim Jong-un meeting Donald Trump\u0026#39s new secretary of state Mike PompeoThe full heart-wrenching case of Alfie Evans and the journey that led his parents to a dramatic u-turnDonald Trump to meet the Queen during his UK visit on Friday 13th JulyComment: Judicial logic and illogical hope have clashed over Alfie EvansNorth and South Korea meet for historic peace talks as neighbours watch with bated breath What it\u0026#39s like to take ayahuasca: My trip with the tribal hallucinogen linked to a brutal lynching in the AmazonAmerica opens first national memorial to lynching victimsFrench town of Vittel suffering water shortages as Nestle accused of \u0026#39overusing\u0026#39 resourcesBill Cosby found guilty of sexual assault by jury in PhiladelphiaImmigration lawyers using delaying tactics to keep illegal immigrants in Britain, High Court says Duke and Duchess of Cambridge still \u0026#39working on\u0026#39 name for the Royal babyLow pay, unsocial hours and immigration law are causing a crisis in horse racingZoe Ball tried to save her lover before he killed himself, inquest hearsAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father in dramatic u-turn as he asks supporters to \u0026#39return to their lives\u0026#39 in his \u0026#39last\u0026#39 interviewLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowSpain ‘wolf pack’ cleared of gang raping teenager during bull festival Comment: Building-one room flats will not resolve the housing crisisWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/25/TELEMMGLPICT000135643698_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrnKnv-EZ40EhYX8nU7dr81GwsaKsFlgjiGj2x2RvG-c.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tsb meltdown shows never accept slaves technology","story":"IT failures at British Airways, the NHS and now TSB have shaken our confidence in companies\u0026#39 use of our data  I remember very clearly my father’s initial scepticism about electric car windows.

She said that her child had been disturbed by the publication of the photograph, which she considered to be private.The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. The photograph had been taken ten years ago, so it did not consider that the child, who was not named in the article, would be easily recognisable from the image. It also noted that the image was publicly available on the complainant’s public Facebook page. The newspaper said that in any case, there was also a public interest in publishing the photograph as it helped to bring home to readers the gravity of the situation in which children had been involved.The article clearly reported on a subject which involved the child’s welfare: she had been involved in a shooting and had witnessed her mother being shot and seriously injured. The un-pixilated photograph of the child showed her full face. The image of the child had been taken 10 years ago however, this did not justify the newspaper’s decision to publish it un-pixilated in the context of this article as the child was still under 16 at the time of publication.Publishing the unedited image in the context of this story, without the consent of a parent or a similarly responsible adult, represented a breach of Clause 6. There was no specific public interest in publishing this image, particularly as an exceptional public interest justification was required in the case of a child.

The extent of Japan\u0027s frustration became clear when it lodged a complaint with South Korea about the dinner menu for its summit with Kim.Tokyo objected to a mango mousse decorated with a map of the Korean peninsula because it included some islands over which Japan claims sovereignty.Meanwhile, Mr Trump revealed that a recent meeting in Pyongyang between Mike Pompeo, the CIA Director, and Kim lasted over an hour. Sarah Sanders later tweeted out a pictures of the meeting. The US president said he was considering three or four dates, and five locations, for his summit with Kim. He told Fox News: \u0026quotThis is a much more dangerous ballgame now, but I will tell you it\u0027s going very well.The nuclear war would have happened if you have weak people.\u0026quot Mr Trump added: \u0026quotI\u0027m saying to myself wait a minute, all of these things he (Kim) has given up, and we haven\u0027t even really that much asked them. I never gave up anything.\u0026quotWhat’s on the menu at the Korean summit | Symbolism explainedIt came as Emmanuel Macron said he believed Mr Trump will withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal. At the end of a three-day visit to Washington, the French president said: \u0026quotMy view is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons.\u0026quotMr Macron warned doing so could undermine attempts to decnulearise North Korea. Jim Mattis, the US defence secretary, also struck a cautionary tone on North Korea \u0026quotin light of Kim\u0027s family, and himself, breaking every international treaty, every agreement, they\u0027ve ever made\u0026quot.Kim was due to be the first North Korean leader in the South since an armistice at the end of the Korean War in 1953. He was due to meet the South Korean president in the Demilitarised Zone\u0027s Peace House, across a table designed to look like two bridges merging into one.Kim and Mr Moon were due to inspect an honour guard, plant a tree, and walk together across a footbridge.The North Korean leader\u0027s travel arrangements were expected to include bringing his own portable toilet.Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said the world must maintain sanctions on North Korea until \u0026quotconcrete changes\u0026quot in its actions were seen.“It’s very complicated,” argues John Delury, a professor at Seoul’s Yonsei university. “If we’re seriously talking about denuclearisation then we have to be talking as seriously about peace,” he said in an interview with the .  However, bringing a definitive end to an uneasy truce that has existed on the peninsula for almost seven decades could be done in a number of ways. “One level is a treaty or a signed document and then there are other documents short of a treaty like a peace declaration,” said Mr Delury. Pledging to work towards a document would only be the first step, he pointed out. “There’s a process around the signing and the drafting of a negotiation. In fact, there’s a whole elaborate process that involves real things, real hardware, real military assets that will be moved back, that would be decommissioned to make the Korean peninsula less hostile, to make it a place that is not where fingers are around the trigger.” The end of the Korean War would also have profound implications for the US, which has some 28,000 troops stationed in South Korea and conducts annual drills with the South’s own military forces. The troops presence and the drills have historically provoked a furious reaction from Pyongyang, which has in turn used this perceived threat from the US to justify the advancement own nuclear and missiles programmes as a deterrent. As a result, the question of a peace treaty is intricately woven into the prospects for successfully persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. The substance of denuclearisation talks will likely be pushed forward to Kim’s meeting with President Trump, expected sometime in late May or early June, but experts have cautioned that Washington and Pyongyang are not on the same page about what the term actually means. Initial excitement about Kim’s public commitment last weekend to suspend nuclear and missile tests quickly dissipated with the realisation that this did not mean he had decided to give up his nuclear weapons. More likely, it was a declaration of his satisfaction that his nuclear programme is now so far advanced that further tests are not needed in the immediate future. The US, meanwhile, has not relinquished its clear demand of the “comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation” (CVID) of North Korea. There is currently no common ground between the US and North Korea over the definition of denuclearisation, argued Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia programme at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in DC. “North Korea is sticking by its traditional position that it will denuclearise if the US removes all strategic capabilities from the region and ends US extended deterrence guarantees defending South Korea,” he said. “That’s a striking comparison to where president Trump is. He’s been very simplistic in his approach, just saying that North Korea will not have nuclear weapons.”Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Why did you drop bombs on another country?\u0026#39 Children grill White House press secretary Sarah Sanders Primary school plans to close at lunchtime on Fridays to give teachers more spare timePictures released of Kim Jong-un meeting Donald Trump\u0026#39s new secretary of state Mike PompeoThe full heart-wrenching case of Alfie Evans and the journey that led his parents to a dramatic u-turnDonald Trump to meet the Queen during his UK visit on Friday 13th JulyComment: Judicial logic and illogical hope have clashed over Alfie EvansWhat it\u0026#39s like to take ayahuasca: My trip with the tribal hallucinogen linked to a brutal lynching in the AmazonAmerica opens first national memorial to lynching victimsFrench town of Vittel suffering water shortages as Nestle accused of \u0026#39overusing\u0026#39 resourcesBill Cosby found guilty of sexual assault by jury in PhiladelphiaImmigration lawyers using delaying tactics to keep illegal immigrants in Britain, High Court says Duke and Duchess of Cambridge still \u0026#39working on\u0026#39 name for the Royal babyLow pay, unsocial hours and immigration law are causing a crisis in horse racingZoe Ball tried to save her lover before he killed himself, inquest hearsAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father in dramatic u-turn as he asks supporters to \u0026#39return to their lives\u0026#39 in his \u0026#39last\u0026#39 interviewLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowSpain ‘wolf pack’ cleared of gang raping teenager during bull festival Comment: Building-one room flats will not resolve the housing crisisTrue Horror\u0026#39s grandfather from hell: the strange story of the Ghost in the WallWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 26 april 2018","story":"A £5,000 dog kennel, Meghan Markle during Anzac Day commemorations and a Black Hawk helicopter are some of Thursday\u0027s pictures of the dayNicola Sturgeon \u0026#39dancing on the head of a pin\u0026#39 to avoid Brexit Bill deal\u0026#39Why did you drop bombs on another country?\u0026#39 Children grill White House press secretary Sarah Sanders Primary school plans to close at lunchtime on Fridays to give teachers more spare timePictures released of Kim Jong-un meeting Donald Trump\u0026#39s new secretary of state Mike PompeoThe full heart-wrenching case of Alfie Evans and the journey that led his parents to a dramatic u-turnDonald Trump to meet the Queen during his UK visit on Friday 13th JulyComment: Judicial logic and illogical hope have clashed over Alfie EvansNorth and South Korea meet for historic peace talks as neighbours watch with bated breath What it\u0026#39s like to take ayahuasca: My trip with the tribal hallucinogen linked to a brutal lynching in the AmazonAmerica opens first national memorial to lynching victimsFrench town of Vittel suffering water shortages as Nestle accused of \u0026#39overusing\u0026#39 resourcesBill Cosby found guilty of sexual assault by jury in PhiladelphiaImmigration lawyers using delaying tactics to keep illegal immigrants in Britain, High Court says Duke and Duchess of Cambridge still \u0026#39working on\u0026#39 name for the Royal babyLow pay, unsocial hours and immigration law are causing a crisis in horse racingZoe Ball tried to save her lover before he killed himself, inquest hearsAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father in dramatic u-turn as he asks supporters to \u0026#39return to their lives\u0026#39 in his \u0026#39last\u0026#39 interviewLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowSpain ‘wolf pack’ cleared of gang raping teenager during bull festival Comment: Building-one room flats will not resolve the housing crisisWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/s3/files/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/06/11/books.jpg","title":"decolonise science time end imperial era racism british empire","story":"A great deal of modern science was built on exploitation, as European empires justified colonial activities through the ‘gifts’ of medical advancement. Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But this will not work. The UK has decided to withdraw from the Union. It wants to be sovereign and be able to set its own rulebook, to have its own supervision and enforcement system.“In doing so, the UK will move away from EU rules. It will not accept common EU supervision and enforcement tools. These are precisely the essential building blocks of our post-crisis financial regulation. They ensure that the internal market can exist and function correctly.‘Everything must change so that everything can stay the same’, to paraphrase Lampedusa. But this will not work.“The EU understands that the UK does not want to become a \u0027rule-taker\u0027. But the UK also needs to understand that the EU cannot accept mutual market access without the common safeguards that underpin it.”Mr Barnier added that relying on Britain to regulate services sold into EU markets was “not something that any country in the world would accept”. He described Brexit as “a lose-lose situation”, telling his audience: “I do not see added value in Brexit and so far, nobody has shown us any.”“Outside of the customs union and the single market, there can be no frictionless trade. Businesses will be faced with non-tariff barriers and border checks that do not exist today,” the chief negotiator warned.Allowing British firms to sell services into the EU is crucial for the UK because around 80 per cent of the British economy comes from providing services, with about 43 per cent of British exports heading to the EU in 2016. The Government has said it want any trade deal with the EU to cover services.Speaking at the same event Mr Barnier said the cost of Brexit “will be substantially higher for the UK than for the EU”, noting that in terms of “trade dependency” the EU27 accounts for around 50 per cent of UK export and imports, while the UK market accounts for 7 per cent of EU exports and 4 per cent of imports. Theresa May has asked for the EU and UK to mutually recognise each others\u0027 rules and regulations as adequate (AP)The Brussels Brexit chief also brushed away claims by British commentators that European businesses desperately needs the City of London for finance. He cited research by the European Central Bank that any problem caused by losing access to London\u0027s banks appears limited and said the claim was not what we hear from market participants, and is not the analysis that we have made ourselves.In her Mansion House speech last month Ms May called for a “comprehensive system of mutual recognition” where both blocs pledged to keep their regulations equivalent to one another to facilitate trade. She said that under such a system “UK law may not necessarily be identical to EU law, but it should achieve the same outcomes”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Barnier has previously said such an approach is only compatible with a free trade agreement similar to that the EU has with Japan, a country on the other side of the world. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Should the Conservatives manage to hold these seats, it will not be a sign of success, merely the avoidance of utter disaster”.When respondents were asked which party they would vote for at a local elections, the results showed that 51 per cent support Labour while 29 per cent backed the Conservatives.

They were arrested minutes before their flight was due to take off and gave blood samples at Govan Police Station.The samples were split \u0026ndash one half for the prosecution and the other for the accused to have independently tested as a possible defence production in any future court proceedings.However, prison officer Paul Scoular, 46, did not know what to do with the samples when the pair were booked into custody at HMP Low Moss-in-Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow.Despite more than 20 years in the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), Mr -Scoular had never previously admitted a remand inmate who was in possession of medical samples.WATCHTOWERJean-Francois Perreault was accused of having drunk 1.5 times the drink-fly limitJail nurse Mara Fraser, 54, put the samples in a locked drawer in an office as she \u0026ldquodidn\u0026rsquot know the protocol, then destroyed them by disposing of them in a clinical waste bin when she learned the pilots had been released.Defence lawyers argued the prosecution\u0026rsquos samples should not be allowed as evidence and the men\u0026rsquos right to a fair trial had been denied.At a hearing at the Court of Appeal in Edinburgh earlier this month, judges ruled the prosecution\u0026rsquos samples should not be allowed as evidence \u0026ndash leading to the pilots being cleared.Neither pilot was at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday for the brief hearing.Prosecutors at the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) last night said they were working with Police Scotland on a protocol for handling samples given to accused parties.Perreault and Syed, who were suspended by Air Transat after they were arrested, will now be able to fly again after being cleared of all wrongdoing.Concorde was a turbojet passenger airliner capable of transatlantic flights in half the time of other airlines.
