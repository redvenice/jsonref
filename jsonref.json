He turned the situation to his advantage by interviewing them.          Deke made regular references on air to the fact he was broadcasting from - and to - 57 Gonville Crescent.Sundays were his biggest day, with a non-stop service running from 6am to 12pm with the help of two other enthusiasts.‘We used to record all the shows and play them back and think, “That’s cool” - but we couldn’t afford to keep buying spools of tape, so recorded over them,’ he said.Mr Duncan - real name Eric Thorp - remarried in 2013 and now lives in Stockport, Greater Manchester, where his new wife Pamela plays the loyal role of dedicated listener.His lucky break came when BBC Archive recently tweeted the Nationwide report, leading to Three Counties to track him down.During the item - in which he sported a shaggy hairstyle and trendy sideburns - he mentioned his ambition was to broadcast to the ‘whole of Stevenage’.          Deke, pictured on BBC Three Counties Radio, said his interest in radio was sparked by pirate station Radio Caroline, which broadcast off the coast of Essex in the 1960s          Deke set up Radio 77 - named after a job-lot of second hand jingles bought from an American station of the same name. Deke is pictured on BBC Three Counties RadioBut when he took part in the show on Sunday, Three Counties station editor Laura Moss told him: ‘We think we can go one better than that and not only would we like to broadcast to Stevenage, how does the whole of Beds, Herts and Bucks sound?’The plan has met with approval on social media. Rae Earl wrote: ‘I think this is just lovely... Wonderful!’Another user said: ‘Put a grin on my chin.’ A third tweeted: ‘He’s waited 44 years for this. I love this story.’Mr Duncan’s first wife, Theresa Buckley, was celebrating her 25th wedding anniversary yesterday(MON).She insisted his passion for radio wasn’t the reason their marriage ended.‘I went along with it. He wasn’t doing it all the time though - he took breaks,’ the 66-year-old said.‘It was a bit of an obsession for him. Most of the time when he wasn’t at work he’d be in the shed.‘He wanted to do it as a career. He did actually get offered a job on a pirate radio ship but it closed down. That was before I married him.’She added: ‘I think he’s excited about the BBC show. I was with my daughter when he phoned to tell her about it.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"Best way cook fried rice flipping wok 0 32 seconds say scientists","story":"    Scientists say secret of the perfect stir-fry is tossing rice every third of a secondBroward County FINALLY gets it right!

I am a man. The worst? I\u0027m actually proud to be a man and I like being masculineI have a confession to make.This isn’t easy, and I’ve taken a long time to summons up the strength to do it.I’m aware that just by admitting to what I’m about to admit, I will subject myself to all manner of global shame and ridicule.I’ll be taunted, abused, shunned and reviled.But as Sir Winston Churchill once so rightly said: ‘You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.’OK, here goes…I am a man.Yes, on International Men’s Day 2018, I am hereby identifying as the biological sex that I was born to.This alone is enough to risk making me a social pariah these days, but that’s not even the worst of it.I’m a man who’s actually proud of being a man, and who also likes being MASCULINE.Sorry.I realise this is a horrendous thing to say, and I can only offer my insincere apologies to all the radical feminists now exploding with rage as they read my shocking statement.If there’s one thing they loathe even more than the M-word, it’s the longer M-word.But why?Masculinity simply means ‘having qualities or appearances traditionally associated with men.’That’s it, nothing more sinister.Yet thanks to women of radical feminist persuasion who’ve gleefully hijacked the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns to serve their own man-hating purpose, masculinity has become the most controversial, detestable word in the English lexicon.And it’s now impossible to be ‘masculine’ without also being accused of ‘toxic masculinity’.          Radical feminists (here\u0027s Madonna in her shirt touting her \u0027radical\u0027 position) have hijacked the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns to serve their own man-hating purpose, masculinity has become the most controversial, detestable word in the English lexiconEven Prince Charming whisking Cinderella off from captive hell to a life of happiness is an evil that must be expunged from society – led by furious Keira Knightley and her ultra feminist knights in PC armour.‘Cinderella waits for a rich guy to rescue her,’ she sneered. ‘Don’t. Rescue yourself! Obviously!’Fine empowering words until you remember that the Prince gallantly saved Cinderella from abuse and slavery and they genuinely loved each other.Then it doesn’t seem quite so ‘obvious’, does it?One of the very worst of the many terrible things about radical feminism is the scourge of pathetic male virtue-signallers that urge them on.As an obvious (or so I thought..) tongue-in-cheek joke this morning, I tweeted: ‘Happy #InternationalMensDay! Stay strong lads, we’re not illegal – yet.’Most people reacted in the way I would react if someone else had tweeted that – by laughing.Others weren’t so amused, bombarding me with hateful abuse about my supposed ‘toxic masculinity’.A man named Box Brown, who has a verified Twitter account and claims to be a New York Times best-selling cartoonist, replied simply: ‘Die.’How laughably hypocritical this angry little clown races to attack what he presumably perceives to be my aggressive maleness, yet does so by saying he wants me dead.Hypocrisy is sadly a prevalent theme with much of modern feminism.The likes of Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajkowski have both built hugely lucrative careers out of stripping off in the supposed name of ‘feminist empowerment’.          Hypocrisy is sadly a prevalent theme with much of modern feminism. Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajkowski have built lucrative careers out of stripping off for ‘feminist empowerment’When in fact what they’re really doing is selling nudity and sex.I have no problem with that - just don’t pretend it benefits any other woman or is anything that Emmeline Pankhurst and her Suffragettes would have ever done.They were too busy risking their lives to win women the right to vote, than to have time to writhe naked in spaghetti and ludicrously claim they were doing so to liberate womankind.When I say this kind of thing, women ask me to cite an example of what I consider real feminist empowerment.So let me give you one from yesterday, when a 17-year old German girl driver named Sophia Flörsch was competing in her first Formula 3 World Cup race at the Macau Grand Prix.The race featured male and female drivers, and she qualified purely on merit.On the fourth lap, she struck another driver’s car as she approached a bend at 175mph.The collision caused Sophia’s car to spin out of control and catapult several hundred yards through the air into a wall.It’s the most horrifying car crash I have ever seen, and everyone who watches it would presume she must have died.But Sophia lived, despite fracturing her spine."},{"url":null,"title":"Traveller admits blackmailing brewery boss 20 000","story":"Thomas Ward, 43, of Aspull, near Wigan, admitted blackmail, conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit criminal damage\u0027It could certainly radicalise someone\u0027: Muslim imam...Share this articleJohn Ward 33 (left) admitted the conspiracy offences.

Dr Francesca Carpos-Young arrives at the Central London Employment Tribunal. The tribunal ruled she was wrongfully fired as her remarks were taken out of contextThe professor, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, said the notes were referencing findings she had made interviewing more than 100 musicians for her PhD over discrimination in their industry.In a written ruling employment Judge Goodman and colleagues upheld her claims for wrongful dismissal and victimisation.Prof Carpos-Young could now get her old job back - which she is demanding. This will be discussed at a remedy hearing when compensation will be agreed.Her notes read: \u0027Everyone knows that having a good reputation is important. But how do you get one?\u0027At the very least, you need to consider the following tips: \u0027Be discreet what\u0027s on tour stays on tour. Become familiar with shared understanding of anecdote, caricature, stereotype and jokes.\u0027Google them and look on YouTube, if this is not your culture. For example, you may hear terms like this: Pond life  (string players). Gypos (short for gypsies)  violinists specifically\u0027.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young told the tribunal: \u0027The notes contained some of the discriminatory language my PhD research showed professional musicians had used.\u0027The terms illuminated ways some iniduals in the industry * engage in conduct which would in my view be unlawful because it is discriminatory.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young said she circulated her notes to the student body at the request of deputy principal Tim Jones. Three students complained one of whom, named as Dan Shao, posted them on social media.Soon other students piled in to complain, one writing: \u0027I was extremely shocked. I feel certain areas of this document are completely inappropriate and offensive.\u0027For example terminology of violins as gypos, look young, be clubbable* To highlight but a few!\u0027Another said: \u0027 I do not want to be advised on keeping my head down, be told brass players got drunk and string players are bores who can be found drinking tea\u0027But wait, doesn\u0027t that mean they don\u0027t appear \u0027young, up together and cool\u0027? But maybe they are still \u0027clubbable\u0027, whatever that is supposed to mean\u0027.Of the term \u0027gypos\u0027 they wrote: \u0027I can\u0027t even imagine how actual violinists who happen to be Sinti or Roma feel about it.\u0027This list is a manual for how to behave like an arsehole. I expect Francesca to apologise for sending this out.\u0027The tribunal heard 58 students then signed an open letter saying: \u0027Clearly Fran\u0027s letter is not an exception to an otherwise idyllic and welcoming environment but rather a symptom of a much broader and deeper failure to live up to institutional aims regarding equality and ersity.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young was fired for gross misconduct for \u0027bringing the academy into disrepute.\u0027Professor Jones said he only decided to sack her mid-way through their meeting on November 3 last year after she became \u0027confrontational\u0027.The tribunal said the good feedback from her lecture may have lulled her into thinking her comments would be \u0027read as intended.\u0027Judge Goodman said: \u0027Some (a very small proportion) of the content was provocative, an old pedagogical technique to stimulate interest.\u0027On the other hand, she was a woman of mature judgement, who had been in education in London, at least part-time, for some years, and so familiar with the culture of protest and activism in which isolated terms can be seized on and misrepresented by a minority as condoning or encouraging the behaviour it describes, all magnified in influence by social media.\u0027To that extent only - that she should have considered more carefully how her words might read if taken without introduction to the lecture material and out of context, and should have edited them with that in mind - was she in any way negligent in her duties as a lecturer and so at fault in contributing to what occurred.\u0027The tribunal concluded there should be a reduction in her award - of \u0027not more than ten percent\u0027 - to reflect this lack of judgement in failing to anticipate how her notes might be read by a younger generation.Prof Carpos-Young had only been hired by the academy, whose patron is the Queen, two months earlier. The presidency is held by the Duchess of Gloucester and was formerly held by Princess Diana.She said: \u0027Tim said that I had brought the academy into disrepute.\u0027He said that sending the document without context and bringing the academy into serious disrepute was gross misconduct and that he was terminating my employment with immediate effect. He told me that I wasn\u0027t going to receive any notice pay.\u0027This came like a bolt out of the blue for me. I was extremely shocked and hadn\u0027t expected anything like this.The professor\u0027s claims of whistle-blowing and sexual discrimination were dismissed  - but she won on the grounds of wrongful dismissal, victimisation and failure to be accompanied at a hearing.  "},{"url":null,"title":"No no Brazilian man cries help tried mugging female jiu jitsu novice","story":"    An aspiring flight attendant from Brazil took matters into her own hands and prevented a cell phone thief from escaping by placing an arm-bar on him for almost 20 minutes before cops arrived to make the arrest          Magdeel da Silva was placed into an arm-lock and could be heard crying for help after he and an accomplice tried stealing a cell phone from a woman in BrazilLeites, who is studying to be a flight attendant and holds a white belt in the mixed martial arts sport, decided to defend herself since four cell phones had already been stolen in prior home invasions, according to Brazilian news outlet D24AM. Da Silva\u0027s unidentified cohort managed to escape on the motorcycle and da Silva himself tried to make a run for it as well.Leites\u0027 neighbor saw the mugging attempt and ran the teenage criminal over with his car.Horrific footage captures men and women throwing bottles,...Shocking moment a man gets sucker punched by a thug as he...Share this articleThe young woman then used one of the most common jiu-jitsu techniques to keep da Silva from escaping the scene, keeping it steady for 20 minutes until the cops arrived.\u0027When you have the technique you  know how to act in a situation of immobilization because all this is a technique of immobilization,\u0027 Leites said.Despite utilizing her acquired mixed martial arts training to fend off the attack - she told news outlet G1 she tossed the phone inside the home - Leites understood the dangers behind her decision to go up against two dangerous men.

The National Trust has identified it as the cyclops Polephemus, from Homer’s Odyssey.Several basic illustrations of men’s heads also appear in the margins of the book, which contains two of Euripides’ dramas, Iphigenia in Aulis and Iphigenia in Tauris. According to a spokesperson for the National Trust, William John “was not known for his academic prowess, but for his love of outdoor pursuits. He’d much rather have been out hunting and riding … hence the doodling.”“Another of Euripides’ very well-known surviving dramas is Cyclops – specifically about Polyphemus. This is still performed today, so no doubt schoolboys would have been aware of its existence, and enthralled by the terrifying image of the man-eating Polyphemus,” said the spokesperson.A team of conservation staff and volunteers is currently restoring and cataloguing almost 2,500 books in the Chute family’s library at The Vyne, carrying out their work in front of visitors and sharing their discoveries of the scribblings in the margins, pictures and personal letters they find as they go along.Once a great Tudor house, The Vyne was home to the Chute family for more than 350 years. It was saved from disrepair by the Victorian brother and sister William Wiggett Chute and Caroline Workman, and was given to the National Trust in 1956.Dominique Shembry, The Vyne’s house steward, said that in the 19th century, the Wiggett Chute family used to stage theatrical performances there, using the books of children’s plays which are still in the library.“The pages are littered with directions in the margins, and you can see their names written beside the parts they were to play. They really draw you into this family’s world,” said Shembry. “They clearly loved books, and they made use of them, too they didn’t just display them.”Shembry’s favourite doodle so far, she said, is titled Practical Measuring Made Easy to the Meanest Capacity By a New Set of Tables. “Inside are sketches of windows for The Vyne’s towers and complicated calculations, made by owner Anthony Chute in 1746 when he was trying to make practical upgrades to the house,” she said. “Everything we enjoy at The Vyne today is only here because of William Wiggett Chute’s determination to save the house from decay in the 19th century. And that includes the library, which he built, recycling bits and pieces where he could to save money. Some of the decoration comes from the family’s pew in the local church, but he also poached pieces from other rooms in the house.”Last month, the Museum of English Rural Life caused a sensation when it revealed it had discovered a sketch of a chicken wearing trousers in the pages of a maths book dating back to 1784. The 13-year-old Richard Beale, from a farm in Biddenden, Kent, had included the chicken alongside the equations he had written out in a diary. “When you see a 13-year-old from the 18th century doing the kind of doodles that kids are doing today, it is so relatable – there’s an instant connection,” said the museum’s programme manager Adam Koszary at the time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d7041aa8481190b8f11f5197204400bbca1db1/0_24_1010_606/master/1010.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e29333ed4a5924e9f43b7eb8e0a6c6","title":"evening in paradise lucia berlin review","story":"A second posthumous selection of stories by the feted American author of A Manual for Cleaning Women shines with compassion and dark witA 14-year-old girl in Chile is seduced by a wealthy widower moments after their carriage plunges into an icy stream. A pregnant woman murders her wealthy husband’s heroin dealer in Mexico while her children sleep upstairs. An old lady hurls abuse at her party guests from the roof of her house in Texas.There are no cosy places to settle in the short stories of Lucia Berlin. The long-overlooked American writer walks us coolly into the unthinkable. “There are things people just don’t talk about,” says the teenage narrator in Dust to Dust, having witnessed the bloody death of her friend in a motorcycle race. “I don’t mean the hard things, like love, but the awkward ones, like how funerals are fun sometimes or how it’s exciting to watch buildings burning.”Berlin died in 2004 and became something of a literary sensation in 2015 when 43 of her 77 stories were anthologised in A Manual for Cleaning Women. Evening in Paradise is a collection of 22 more raw, elliptical, devilishly funny tales that draw on her own precarious, peripatetic life. And Berlin was no wallflower. She was married three times – to a work-obsessed sculptor, an uncommunicative jazz pianist and a charming drug addict – and had four sons before the age of 30. She lived variously in Texas, Chile, New Mexico and New York, tried every kind of job from cleaner to university professor and experienced both wealth and poverty. Meanwhile, she wrote. Her stories were published by small journals and university presses from the 1960s to the 1980s, but her name remained a secret literary handshake among devotees such as Saul Bellow and Lydia Davis.Berlin is now often held up alongside her male coevals – and fellow alcoholics – Raymond Carver and Richard Yates, so-called “dirty realists”, who cast cold, appraising eyes at the underbelly of American life. But these comparisons don’t do justice to the wily humour she developed in dealing with a generation of male artists deeply invested in maintaining male status. Time and again in Evening in Paradise, we encounter bohemian men who talk about poetry, jazz and painting but keep their wives stuck in crushing domestic routines. These wives hold the hot part of the cup when they pass the men their coffee, they iron their underwear so it’s warm when they wake up, but their pent-up frustration is never far from the surface. Some must endanger the life of the postman or watch the flame from a lantern set fire to a curtain just to feel alive.This latest collection is by no means the dross left over from her last book, though some of the one-page flash fictions are more exercises in voice than immersive narratives. Characters, settings and themes recur but in a startling variety of registers. Two Wives, in which a pair of alcoholic women dissect their relationships with the same ex-husband, has the pickled wit of a Tom Waits song. “I wanted a baby so badly,” says the first wife. “We tried for years. Years. And fought over it, because I was so obsessed, each of us blaming the other. I could have killed that OBGYN Rita when she had his baby.”Arranged by her publishers in a roughly chronological order, the collection works as a sort of fractured autofiction too. You can’t help wondering if Berlin really did brain a drug dealer and dump him at sea, as described in La Barca de la Illusion. (It is characteristic that when the narrator fails to stab the associate to death, he changes into one of the husband’s T-shirts with the slogan “Support Mental Health.”) Berlin’s evocative but sketchy memoir, Welcome Home, also newly published, offers no clue as to whether the murder ever happened, but every other detail of the story is taken from real life.Throughout these tales, cruelty is intertwined with compassion. The most poignant is Lead Street, Albuquerque, which tells of three young women who get pregnant so their husbands can avoid conscription to the Korean war. The narrator mocks the most “simple” wife in the trio before hearing her own snobbishness. “Came over one morning ecstatic because she figured out that she could just lie in bed and pull at the sheets and blankets tight, then just slide out carefully and tuck everything in. A real time-saver! She saved butter wrappers to oil cake pans with. Why am I being so petty? I loved her.”The details are acute and funny, but it’s those final two lines that come back and smack you. It’s clear from her rather batty letters that Berlin’s mind was always skipping ahead and reversing on itself. “Alcoholics think more than most people and that’s the truth,” she writes in one story.What does calm Berlin’s mind is nature, which creates a sustained pause in her work. Whenever her women feel despair, they find comfort in poplars, bougainvillea, hibiscus and gardenias. They plant seeds, but then they’re on the move again and rarely get to see them flourish.Berlin’s own reputation is now in full bloom. It’s a shame she’s not around to enjoy it.• Evening in Paradise: More Stories by Lucia Berlin is published by Picador (£14.99). To order a copy for £10.49 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book.

I said at the outset, this year has been the most challenging we have seen.He expected Christmas to be “not a disaster but not enough to rescue the growing number of weaker players finding the intensity of trade and pace of change too quick”.But Richard Perks, the director of retail research at Mintel, said high-street operators could breathe a sigh of relief that sales growth would continue.“While there’s been much talk of how the high street is being undermined by online retailing, it still only represents a relatively small part of overall retail sales, with most shopping still taking place in physical stores.”He blamed clothing retailers’ difficulties on their failure to keep up with changing consumer demands.“Many of the clothing retailers have performed badly in the face of competition from online players. While plenty of clothing retailers have performed well (TK Maxx and a raft of smaller ones including Superdry and Seasalt), too many have gone risk averse, rather than realising that, to succeed in the current market, they cannot afford to play it safe,” Perks said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0dd320bc41c0cda02c61aca6302309bf2254519/156_780_2993_1795/master/2993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b93f16afea135f8b9b7e131dd6604ab","title":"high score low pay gamification lyft uber drivers ride hailing gig economy","story":"Using ratings, competitions and bonuses to incentivise workers isn’t new – but as I found when I became a Lyft driver, the gig economy is taking it to another level. By  Sarah MasonIn May 2016, after months of failing to find a traditional job, I began driving for the ride-hailing company Lyft. I was enticed by an online advertisement that promised new drivers in the Los Angeles area a $500 “sign-up bonus” after completing their first 75 rides. The calculation was simple: I had a car and I needed the money. So, I clicked the link, filled out the application, and, when prompted, drove to the nearest Pep Boys for a vehicle inspection. I received my flamingo-pink Lyft emblems almost immediately and, within a few days, I was on the road.Initially, I told myself that this sort of gig work was preferable to the nine-to-five grind. It would be temporary, I thought. Plus, I needed to enrol in a statistics class and finish my graduate school applications – tasks that felt impossible while working in a full-time desk job with an hour-long commute. But within months of taking on this readily available, yet strangely precarious form of work, I was weirdly drawn in.Lyft, which launched in 2012 as Zimride before changing its name a year later, is a car service similar to Uber, which operates in about 300 US cities and expanded to Canada (thought so far just in one province, Ontario) last year. Ever week, it sends its drivers a personalised “Weekly Feedback Summary”. This includes passenger comments from the previous week’s rides and a freshly calculated driver rating. It also contains a bar graph showing how a driver’s current rating “stacks up” against previous weeks, and tells them whether they have been “flagged” for cleanliness, friendliness, navigation or safety.At first, I looked forward to my summaries for the most part, they were a welcome boost to my self-esteem. My rating consistently fluctuated between 4.89 stars and 4.96 stars, and the comments said things like: “Good driver, positive attitude” and “Thanks for getting me to the airport on time!!” There was the occasional critique, such as “She weird”, or just “Attitude”, but overall, the comments served as a kind of positive reinforcement mechanism. I felt good knowing that I was helping people and that people liked me.But one week, after completing what felt like a million rides, I opened my feedback summary to discover that my rating had plummeted from a 4.91 (“Awesome”) to a 4.79 (“OK”), without comment. Stunned, I combed through my ride history trying to recall any unusual interactions or disgruntled passengers. Nothing. What happened? What did I do? I felt sick to my stomach.Because driver ratings are calculated using your last 100 passenger reviews, one logical solution is to crowd out the old, bad ratings with new, presumably better ratings as fast as humanly possible. And that is exactly what I did.For the next several weeks, I deliberately avoided opening my feedback summaries. I stocked my vehicle with water bottles, breakfast bars and miscellaneous mini candies to inspire riders to smash that fifth star. I developed a borderline-obsessive vacuuming habit and upped my car-wash game from twice a week to every other day. I experimented with different air-fresheners and radio stations. I drove and I drove and I drove.The language of choice, freedom, and autonomy saturate discussions of ride hailing. “On-demand companies are pointing the way to a more promising future, where people have more freedom to choose when and where they work,” Travis Kalanick, the founder and former CEO of Uber, wrote in October 2015. “Put simply,” he continued, “the future of work is about independence and flexibility.”In a certain sense, Kalanick is right. Unlike employees in a spatially fixed worksite (the factory, the office, the distribution centre), rideshare drivers are technically free to choose when they work, where they work and for how long. They are liberated from the constraining rhythms of conventional employment or shift work. But that apparent freedom poses a unique challenge to the platforms’ need to provide reliable, “on demand” service to their riders – and so a driver’s freedom has to be aggressively, if subtly, managed. One of the main ways these companies have sought to do this is through the use of gamification.Simply defined, gamification is the use of game elements – point-scoring, levels, competition with others, measurable evidence of accomplishment, ratings and rules of play – in non-game contexts. Games deliver an instantaneous, visceral experience of success and reward, and they are increasingly used in the workplace to promote emotional engagement with the work process, to increase workers’ psychological investment in completing otherwise uninspiring tasks, and to influence, or “nudge”, workers’ behaviour. This is what my weekly feedback summary, my starred ratings and other gamified features of the Lyft app did.But colour-coding checkout screens is a pretty rudimental kind of gamification. In the world of ride-hailing work, where almost the entirety of one’s activity is prompted and guided by screen – and where everything can be measured, logged and analysed – there are few limitations on what can be gamified.In 1974, Michael Burawoy, a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Chicago and a self-described Marxist, began working as a miscellaneous machine operator in the engine ision of Allied Corporation, a large manufacturer of agricultural equipment. He was attempting to answer the following question: why do workers work as hard as they do?In Marx’s time, the answer to this question was simple: coercion. Workers had no protections and could be fired at will for failing to fulfil their quotas. One’s ability to obtain a subsistence wage was directly tied to the amount of effort one applied to the work process. However, in the early 20th century, with the emergence of labour protections, the elimination of the piece-rate pay system, the rise of strong industrial unions and a more robust social safety net, the coercive power of employers waned.Yet workers continued to work hard, Burawoy observed. They co-operated with speed-ups and exceeded production targets. They took on extra tasks and sought out productive ways to use their downtime. They worked overtime and off the clock. They kissed ass. After 10 months at Allied, Burawoy concluded that workers were willingly and even enthusiastically consenting to their own exploitation. What could explain this? One answer, Burawoy suggested, was “the game”.For Burawoy, the game described the way in which workers manipulated the production process in order to reap various material and immaterial rewards. When workers were successful at this manipulation, they were said to be “making out”. Like the levels of a video game, operators needed to overcome a series of consecutive challenges in order to make out and beat the game.At the beginning of every shift, operators encountered their first challenge: securing the most lucrative assignment from the “scheduling man”, the person responsible for doling out workers’ daily tasks. Their next challenge was a trip to “the crib” to find the blueprint and tooling needed to perform the operation. If the crib attendant was slow to dispense the necessary blueprints, tools and fixtures, operators could lose a considerable amount of time that would otherwise go towards making or beating their quota. (Burawoy won the cooperation of the crib attendant by gifting him a Christmas ham.) After facing off against the truckers, who were responsible for bringing stock to the machine, and the inspectors, who were responsible for enforcing the specifications of the blueprint, the operator was finally left alone with his machine to battle it out against the clock.According to Burawoy, production at Allied was deliberately organised by management to encourage workers to play the game. When work took the form of a game, Burawoy observed, something interesting happened: workers’ primary source of conflict was no longer with the boss. Instead, tensions were dispersed between workers (the scheduling man, the truckers, the inspectors), between operators and their machines, and between operators and their own physical limitations (their stamina, precision of movement, focus).The battle to beat the quota also transformed a monotonous, soul-crushing job into an exciting outlet for workers to exercise their creativity, speed and skill. Workers attached notions of status and prestige to their output, and the game presented them with a series of choices throughout the day, affording them a sense of relative autonomy and control. It tapped into a worker’s desire for self-determination and self-expression. Then, it directed that desire towards the production of profit for their employer.Every Sunday morning, I receive an algorithmically generated “challenge” from Lyft that goes something like this: “Complete 34 rides between the hours of 5am on Monday and 5am on Sunday to receive a $63 bonus.” I scroll down, concerned about the declining value of my bonuses, which once hovered around $100-$220 per week, but have now dropped to less than half that.“Click here to accept this challenge.” I tap the screen to accept. Now, whenever I log into driver mode, a stat meter will appear showing my progress: only 21 more rides before I hit my first bonus. Lyft does not disclose how its weekly ride challenges are generated, but the value seems to vary according to anticipated demand and driver behaviour. The higher the anticipated demand, the higher the value of my bonus. The more I hit my bonus targets or ride quotas, the higher subsequent targets will be. Sometimes, if it has been a while since I have logged on, I will be offered an uncharacteristically lucrative bonus, north of $100, though it has been happening less and less of late.Behavioural scientists and video game designers are well aware that tasks are likely to be completed faster and with greater enthusiasm if one can visualise them as part of a progression towards a larger, pre-established goal. The Lyft stat meter is always present, always showing you what your acceptance rating is, how many rides you have completed, how far you have to go to reach your goal.Retention is a problem in large part because the economics of driving are so bad. Researchers have struggled to establish exactly how much money drivers make, but with the release of two recent reports, one from the Economic Policy Institute and one from MIT, a consensus on driver pay seems to be emerging: drivers make, on average, between $9.21 (£7.17) and $10.87 (£8.46) per hour. What these findings confirm is what many of us in the game already know: in most major US cities, drivers are pulling in wages that fall below local minimum-wage requirements. According to an internal slide deck obtained by the New York Times, Uber actually identifies McDonald’s as its biggest competition in attracting new drivers. When I began driving for Lyft, I made the same calculation most drivers make: it is better to make $9 per hour than to make nothing.Before Lyft rolled out weekly ride challenges, there was the “Power Driver Bonus”, a weekly challenge that required drivers to complete a set number of regular rides. I sometimes worked more than 50 hours per week trying to secure my PDB, which often meant driving in unsafe conditions, at irregular hours and accepting nearly every ride request, including those that felt potentially dangerous (I am thinking specifically of an extremely drunk and visibly agitated late-night passenger).Of course, this was largely motivated by a real need for a boost in my weekly earnings. But, in addition to a hope that I would somehow transcend Lyft’s shitty economics, the intensity with which I pursued my PDBs was also the result of what Burawoy observed four decades ago: a bizarre desire to beat the game.Drivers’ per-mile earnings are supplemented by a number of rewards, both material and immaterial. Uber drivers can earn “Achievement Badges” for completing a certain number of five-star rides and “Excellent Service Badges” for leaving customers satisfied. Lyft’s “Accelerate Rewards” programme encourages drivers to level up by completing a certain number of rides per month in order to unlock special rewards like fuel discounts from Shell (gold level) and free roadside assistance (platinum level).In addition to offering meaningless badges and meagre savings at the pump, ride-hailing companies have also adopted some of the same design elements used by gambling firms to promote addictive behaviour among slot-machine users. One of things the anthropologist and NYU media studies professor Natasha Dow Schüll found during a decade-long study of machine gamblers in Las Vegas is that casinos use networked slot machines that allow them to surveil, track and analyse the behaviour of inidual gamblers in real time – just as ride-hailing apps do. This means that casinos can “triangulate any given gambler’s player data with her demographic data, piecing together a profile that can be used to customise game offerings and marketing appeals specifically for her”. Like these customised game offerings, Lyft tells me that my weekly ride challenge has been “personalised just for you!”Former Google “design ethicist” Tristan Harris has also described how the “pull-to-refresh” mechanism used in most social media feeds mimics the clever architecture of a slot machine: users never know when they are going to experience gratification – a dozen new likes or retweets – but they know that gratification will eventually come. This unpredictability is addictive: behavioural psychologists have long understood that gambling uses variable reinforcement schedules – unpredictable intervals of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback – to condition players into playing just one more round.We are only beginning to uncover the extent to which these reinforcement schedules are built into ride-hailing apps. But one example is primetime or surge pricing. The phrase “chasing the pink” is used in online forums by Lyft drivers to refer to the tendency to drive towards “primetime” areas, denoted by pink-tinted heat maps in the app, which signify increased fares at precise locations. This is irrational because the likelihood of catching a good primetime fare is slim, and primetime is extremely unpredictable. The pink appears and disappears, moving from one location to the next, sometimes in a matter of minutes. Lyft and Uber have to dole out just enough of these higher-paid periods to keep people driving to the areas where they predict drivers will be needed. And occasionally – cherry, cherry, cherry – it works: after the Rose Bowl parade last year, I made in 40 minutes more than half of what I usually make in a whole day of non-stop shuttling.So, who sets the rules for all these games? It is 12.30am on a Friday night and the “Lyft drivers lounge”, a closed Facebook group for active drivers, is ided. The debate began, as many do, with an assertion about the algorithm. “The algorithm” refers to the opaque and often unpredictable system of automated, “data-driven” management employed by ride-hailing companies to dispatch drivers, match riders into Pools (Uber) or Lines (Lyft), and generate “surge” or “primetime” fares, also known as “dynamic pricing”.The algorithm is at the heart of the ride-hailing game, and of the coercion that the game conceals. In their foundational text Algorithmic Labor and Information Asymmetries: A Case Study of Uber’s Drivers, Alex Rosenblat and Luke Stark write: “Uber’s self-proclaimed role as a connective intermediary belies the important employment structures and hierarchies that emerge through its software and interface design.” “Algorithmic management” is the term Rosenblat and Stark use to describe the mechanisms through which Uber and Lyft drivers are directed. To be clear, there is no singular algorithm. Rather, there are a number of algorithms operating and interacting with one another at any given moment. Taken together, they produce a seamless system of automatic decision-making that requires very little human intervention.For many on-demand platforms, algorithmic management has completely replaced the decision-making roles previously occupied by shift supervisors, foremen and middle- to upper- level management. Uber actually refers to its algorithms as “decision engines”. These “decision engines” track, log and crunch millions of metrics every day, from ride frequency to the harshness with which inidual drivers brake. It then uses these analytics to deliver gamified prompts perfectly matched to drivers’ data profiles.Because the logic of the algorithm is largely unknown and constantly changing, drivers are left to speculate about what it is doing and why. Such speculation is a regular topic of conversation in online forums, where drivers post screengrabs of nonsensical ride requests and compare increasingly lacklustre, algorithmically generated bonus opportunities. It is not uncommon for drivers to accuse ride-hailing companies of programming their algorithms to favour the interests of the corporation. To resolve this alleged favouritism, drivers routinely hypothesise and experiment with ways to manipulate or “game” the system back.When the bars let out after last orders at 2am, demand spikes. Drivers have a greater likelihood of scoring “surge” or “primetime” fares. There are no guarantees, but it is why we are all out there. To increase the prospect of surge pricing, drivers in online forums regularly propose deliberate, coordinated, mass “log-offs” with the expectation that a sudden drop in available drivers will “trick” the algorithm into generating higher surges. I have never seen one work, but the authors of a recently published paper say that mass log-offs are occasionally successful.Viewed from another angle, though, mass log-offs can be understood as good, old-fashioned work stoppages. The temporary and purposeful cessation of work as a form of protest is the core of strike action, and remains the sharpest weapon workers have to fight exploitation. But the ability to log-off en masse has not assumed a particularly emancipatory function. Burawoy’s insights might tell us why.Gaming the game, Burawoy observed, allowed workers to assert some limited control over the labour process, and to “make out” as a result. In turn, that win had the effect of reproducing the players’ commitment to playing, and their consent to the rules of the game. When players were unsuccessful, their dissatisfaction was directed at the game’s obstacles, not at the capitalist class, which sets the rules. The inbuilt antagonism between the player and the game replaces, in the mind of the worker, the deeper antagonism between boss and worker. Learning how to operate cleverly within the game’s parameters becomes the only imaginable option. And now there is another layer interposed between labour and capital: the algorithm.After weeks of driving like a maniac in order to restore my higher-than-average driver rating, I managed to raise it back up to a 4.93. Although it felt great, it is almost shameful and astonishing to admit that one’s rating, so long as it stays above 4.6, has no actual bearing on anything other than your sense of self-worth. You do not receive a weekly bonus for being a highly rated driver. Your rate of pay does not increase for being a highly rated driver. In fact, I was losing money trying to flatter customers with candy and keep my car scrupulously clean. And yet, I wanted to be a highly rated driver.And this is the thing that is so brilliant and awful about the gamification of Lyft and Uber: it preys on our desire to be of service, to be liked, to be good. On weeks that I am rated highly, I am more motivated to drive. On weeks that I am rated poorly, I am more motivated to drive. It works on me, even though I know better.

She is mocked by the opposition and laughed at by the EU.The only option left open to her is to try to win the hearts, or perhaps the underbellies, of voters, by finding an uncomplicated and easy-to-repeat narrative to justify her version of Brexit. The problem is that panic and politics aren’t a good mix.Populist promises such as the one she made this morning to stop EU migrants “jumping the queue” spread resentment towards European citizens like me. Not only did we play no part in this mess, but we work here legally and contribute to the country in many different ways. We did not “jump the queue” but exercised the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain. Even so, our reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere, and infinite red tape when we attempt to apply for permanent residency to set our minds at rest.I was born and grew up in Sicily and moved to London in 1996 shortly after I turned 20 years old.I’ve put down roots here, made friends and created a wonderful family. Since I started working as a photographer I’ve paid my taxes and national insurance contributions and jumped no queues whatsoever. No, I’ve earned the benefits I enjoy – a happy and constructive existence in London – through sheer hard work.Since the referendum in 2016 I have noticed an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse based on my nationality and my Mediterranean appearance. Living life in the face of this stigma is not always easy, but I have enough resources to stand my ground, and thanks to the broad support I receive from friends and colleagues I have the luxury of brushing nasty comments off with irony and a lot of sarcasm. However, this rise in anti-European feeling needs to be addressed and stopped, because it will end in people getting hurt.The dog-whistling May did this morning achieves the exact opposite. It will give permission to any members of the general public who feel that we European citizens are not welcome here to bully, hassle us, or worse.I believe that in the years ahead, as Brexit is exposed as a false solution and times become hard, there will need to be a scapegoat, someone to point at. May is laying the ground for that someone to be an innocent European national living in the UK.I confess that I am shocked by the lack of a strong political counter-narrative to this xenophobia, with the exception of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has been active in stressing the importance of EU nationals living in his city, and explaining how strength and growth is founded on pluralism.Finally I find it strange that we are viewed with condescension even by the most liberal minds in this country. I’m often told: “Ah, you’ll be alright, you’ve been here for many years.” Many British people assume that as an Italian living in the UK I am only concerned about my future here. That is a worry, I suppose. But I have a broader perspective – I am worried for Britain as a whole.What I am witnessing is the country I have chosen to live in taking a wrong turn. I am left with a feeling of deep disappointment in British institutions and British political common sense. I remember how my British friends used to mock Italy for electing Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister, and I loved the fact that I lived in a country that recognised how surreal Italian politics was. Honest, correct sensible Britain on the one hand and crazy, foolish corrupted Italy on the other.Unfortunately the landscape has changed. If the worst comes to the worst, I can still go back to the crazy corrupted Italy we all loved to take the mickey out of. British-born people without another nationality, on the other hand, have no plan B. They are the ones who will be forced to deal with an unrecognisable Britain, bitter and corrupted, the victims of an Etonian gamble gone very wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d83331ca80c819fb7d44c2dae0399147f998d2/137_610_4435_2661/master/4435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ae21e66a8eff080f8c21c08094a59ce","title":"arts climate change","story":"Cultural organisations are in a unique position to challenge, inform and engage audiences in conversations about the environmentIf we are to avoid irreversible global warming that will have devastating economic and social consequences for the world, “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” are required. This was the conclusion of a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in October. We – the collective “we” – have been given 12 years to arrest climate change. The message is clear: everyone is responsible for creating a more environmentally sustainable world. And the arts and cultural sector is no exception.We have been talking about these issues at the Arts Council for a long time, and over the past decade have worked with the climate change charity Julie’s Bicycle to help arts and cultural organisations reduce their environmental impact. In 2012 we became the first cultural body in the world to include environmental reporting and action in our long-term funding agreements with arts organisations. Recognising that we had to create the conditions for change to happen, the Arts Council buttressed these requirements with a programme of support from Julie’s Bicycle. Together we substantially increased understanding about the role of the sector in addressing environmental issues and associated social challenges.We have seen the power of encouraging the arts and cultural community to go on a collective journey. Several major city-wide initiatives have been developed, including the Manchester Arts Sustainability Team – a group of organisations working together to help deliver the city’s first-ever climate change strategy, Manchester: A Certain Future.Arts and cultural companies possess significant purchasing power and can be instrumental in persuading suppliers to make ethical decisions and develop greener products and services. A quarter of our funded organisations are now on a green energy tariff, helping to drive demand for clean energy across the UK. Of course, the overall contribution made by the arts and cultural sector to energy conservation and carbon reduction is comparatively small. But for large parts of our audience it has become paramount that these institutions are setting an example in embracing and advocating for change.Arts and culture make a vital contribution to the creation of a more inclusive and more confident society. They have the power to delight, educate, stimulate and inspire and, at a time of increasing ision and inequality, we need their influence more than ever. As the IPCC report emphasised, the response to global warming must cover every aspect of life. We need action within the commercial sphere and engagement from the public. Artists and arts organisations can shape conversations about the environment. They can challenge and be provocative, both informing and opening our minds.In recent years, there has been an overwhelming response from arts and cultural organisations eager to put this conversation centre stage. They are presenting a range of innovative projects that engage audiences in the issue of climate change. Last week, I visited Invisible Dust in Scarborough, which works with leading visual artists, creative technologists and scientists to encourage meaningful responses to environmental issues. In Kendal, Brewery Arts Centre showed Plastic on the Menu, highlighting issues around plastic in drinking water a VR installation at Leicester’s Phoenix Arts Centre put audiences In the Eyes of the Animal to raise awareness of bioersity in UK woodlands and University of Cambridge Museums developed Operation Survival, in collaboration with Fire Hazard Games, a high-energy competition asking participants to come up with solutions for a world in crisis. When it comes to the environment, time is fast running out. We have to accelerate our response to the threats. The arts has an important role in helping society to face up to the challenge of climate change and create a more sustainable future for us all.• Nicholas Serota is chair of Arts Council England"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e56b5c4baf16bd0b38bfbc2d46beb8950a683f7a/1206_856_3337_2002/master/3337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f590a62563b6a4387799030aad68ea32","title":"hard right brexit tory revolution no deal eu","story":"A group of extremists within the Tory party would welcome the havoc unleashed by ‘no deal’ to advance their causeThe vultures circle a wounded prime minister, who is attacked by the hordes of extremists in her party while beset by new inconvenient facts daily exposing the damage Brexit can do. Look, the British army is preparing for the worst: emergency troops are at the ready. Operation Temperer, which usually provides soldiers for terrorist attacks, is now ordered to make 10,000 soldiers available to keep order on the streets and in shops, and to distribute emergency medicines in case of a no-deal crash-out.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products,” warns the Confederation of British Industry chief, Carolyn Fairbairn.The exasperated chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, Bob Sanguinetti, says: “Those hoping for a no-deal Brexit have a duty to explain in technical detail why this risk is worth taking.” No wonder he finds all this incomprehensible: why is there all this self-induced chaos with no war, terror, epidemic or natural disaster?What few realise is that we are living through a revolution that has been a long time brewing among Tory party entryists. Those clawing to dethrone Theresa May are of a different ilk, only just within a recognisable Tory penumbra. Infiltrators, bent on destroying from within the party that harbours them, inhabit another planet from Heath, Clarke or Heseltine – but nor are they Thatcher’s children, either. Leaving Europe is only a part of their revolutionary project, a means not an end. Because they are revolutionaries, the more dramatic the break and the wilder the chaos, the better. They are bent on the creative destruction of a stagnant old order, so as to plough up the ground for a fertile new radical right beginning. Tax-haven Singapore beckons.There is a (mercifully small) handful of leftwing Brexiters who talk the same way: the old order was bad, so bring on mayhem from which a new utopia can flourish. For both red and blue revolutionaries, any Brexit harm – bound to hurt the vulnerable – is only collateral damage in a greater cause.The recently resigned Brexit secretary Dominic Raab currently leads the betting to take over from May. Since coming into parliament in 2010, he has worked unstintingly for this day. Maybe his ministerial promotion came later than some MPs’ because his seniors could see that glint in his eye: a bit of a loner, he belongs nonetheless to a coterie of the likeminded.Their seminal work in 2012 was Britannia Unchained, written with other 2010 young turks, Liz Truss, Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel and Chris Skidmore. They belong to the much larger – 40 or so – Free Enterprise Group of MPs, sponsored by the Institute of Economic Affairs, which handles their media. (The IEA is under investigation by the Charity Commission after a Greenpeace investigation into US cash for ministerial access and Brexit campaigning.)The group’s website boasts of meeting a former chancellor before budgets to make proposals, “a number of which became policy”. Truss failed to get through her radical deregulation of childminders, or selling off national forests, but her fervour for slashing the state was in high demand at Tory conference fringe meetings.This cadre is so much more extreme than Thatcherism that they iconoclastically dismiss her era. “The last 30 years of public debate have been dominated by leftwing thinking,” says their book, which gained notoriety for its most famous line: “British workers are the worst idlers in the world” who “prefer a lie-in to hard work”. With that, they blamed low UK productivity on the workforce, not on a failure to invest.In his paper Weight Watchers For Whitehall, he calls for abolishing half the 20 government departments, including International Development, Business, Culture, and the “pointless government Equalities Office”. Browse his essay collection Britain, Tomorrow: the Case for Free Enterprise, Meritocracy and Liberty and you find his views on cutting worker protection and the minimum wage, for “no-fault dismissal” and tax cuts for the better off: “Middle-class Peter should not be robbed to pay working-class Paul.” Boris Johnson’s foreword calls it “a blistering collection”.On meritocracy, free schools should select as grammar schools do, which would “drive up standards in other schools”. How can you fail to admire the sheer evidence-free effrontery? “In Britain there has been too great a tendency to attribute results to fortune and background.” Evidence abounds to show how much more closely British children’s success is matched to parental incomes than in other EU countries.The great Brexit rift is a war for the nation’s soul between a radical revolutionary right and a social democracy very much under threat. The right used immigration to capture votes, but Brexit was always a proxy for a deeper project.Raab says no deal would be a “manageable situation”. Yes, they would find it useful. Just as David Cameron and George Osborne used the cover of the great crash to roll out their state-shrinking agenda, so Raab and his Free Enterprise Group would use Brexit havoc to take a yet more radical axe to the state.

What’s behind the trend?In Uusikaupunki, Finland, there is a small museum dedicated to Bonk Business Inc, a “multiglobal industrial conglomerate” specialising in anchovy products, cosmic therapy and localised black holes. The museum chronicles the history and achievements of the company in obsessive detail, displaying old advertisements and inventions dating back to 1893. On the wall hangs a corporate headshot of Sven Triloqvist, vice-president of advanced disinformation systems at Bonk Business Inc.This colourful corporation is, of course, completely fictitious. It is the work of artist and sculptor Alvar Gullichsen, who uses the format of the industrial museum to poke fun at corporate culture in a way that feels both fantastical and plausibly factual. Straight-faced tour guides encourage you to pose for photos with absurd contraptions.Meanwhile, Damien Hirst’s 2017 Venice show Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable presented the artist as a wealthy benefactor funding the retrieval and exhibition of awe-inspiring artefacts from the ocean floor. Accompanying the exhibition was a film that documents the underwater archaeology expedition. But none of it was real: the exhibition, documentary and the treasures themselves were all Hirst’s spoof creations.Fascinating things can be achieved with one foot in history and another in the imaginary. The trappings of historical documentation, or a setting that closely mirrors a place and time in the real world, can lend a flavour of authenticity to art and entertainment. Stéphane Beauverger, the narrative director of Vampyr – a 2018 video game set during London’s Spanish flu pandemic that locates a lurid tale about vampires in recognisable early 20th-century history – calls this concept “imaginary facts”.Imaginary facts, like works of historical fiction, blend the fictitious with the verifiable: they’re used to tell an artificial yet compelling story. In a landscape where “post-truth” and “alternative facts” are part of our everyday vocabulary, this term might put some on the back foot – but the crucial difference between an imaginary fact and an alternative one is that the audience is fully aware it is a pretence.To help us temporarily buy in to the proposed reality, artists use the tools and techniques of popular history: documentaries with talking heads, museum exhibitions with white labels and glass cases, hardbacks stuffed with footnoted essays, and interviews and oral histories recorded in crackling analogue. The Bonk Museum is so effective because it borrows from an academic format we’re already familiar with. Schoolchildren around the world are right this moment being bussed off to industrial museums to learn about the achievements of their nation’s economy and manufacturing sector. Industrial museums have universal characteristics: portraits of wealthy industrialists contrasted with shots of anonymous workers on the factory floor, dioramas of workspaces frozen in time, photo opportunities with obsolete machinery.The second season of podcast series Within the Wires is presented as a series of museum guides. Each episode is ostensibly a guide to a different museum or gallery. Within the Wires uses the techniques usually reserved for non-fiction to tell the jarringly surreal fictional elements of its story. To maintain the illusion, the podcast relies on subtle audio cues, such as repeated beeps that signal the point at which a museum visitor would pause the tape and move on to the next artwork.“We quickly came up with the idea of museum audio guides because it seemed like a fun challenge, as writers, to try to tell a story so obtusely,” says co-writer Jeffrey Cranor, who also helped create Welcome to Night Vale, a podcast presented as a local radio broadcast about a nonexistent town. “Once you have the form, you can figure out who your narrator is and then you can build a story around that person … What can that museum guide narrator reveal about her life and the lives of these other characters?”Sometimes these unorthodox formats can be limiting, says Cranor. “The museum season was actually the hardest of the three we’ve written so far, because of the limitations of the form.” But for him and his co-writer Janina Matthewson, they are an experimental challenge. “It gets us out of the normal mode of A-to-B storytelling: how can you give people a good story without ever actually directly telling it?” This indirect mode of storytelling puts more onus on the audience to connect the dots. It turns the show into a puzzle passed back and forth between creator and listener.The TV series Fargo, meanwhile, borrows from a different format to create the illusion of fact: true-crime drama. One of the only consistent features between seasons is the disclaimer that opens each episode: “This is a true story … At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.” The words of the disclaimer work like a repeated incantation before each episode, casting a spell that suspends our disbelief each week. The video game Mafia III also adopts the aesthetics of true crime, with expert talking heads whose insights bookend the events of the game.The thrill of imaginary facts rests on the audience being in on the deception – those taking photographs at the Bonk Museum and absorbing the month’s spooky events in Welcome to Night Vale are willing and eager dupes. As Cranor puts it, there’s something thrilling about “the humour and the horror of something that looks like and sounds predictable, but then deep down it’s just not quite right. It’s not quite real.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c3eb416b29b32f046040c824eafcb9f2bf40035/0_216_5500_3301/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f330199a9f8138433912d19fb0aaecb8","title":"former academy head given 850000 payoff","story":"Sir Greg Martin was paid out of proceeds from private leisure centre on school groundsThe former head of a controversial academy is being paid an £850,000 severance package out of proceeds from a private leisure centre run on the school grounds, MPs have heard.Details of the payment to Sir Greg Martin, the former head of the Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, emerged on Monday during a hearing of the Commons public accounts committee, which is investigating academy accounts and performance.It is the latest development in a long-running saga involving Martin, who was knighted for services to education and was once a favourite of Tory ministers, before falling out of favour as concerns grew about financial management and governance at the school.Durand Academy has since been transferred to a new sponsor and has been renamed the Van Gogh primary school, but the Durand Education Trust (DET) retained ownership of the private leisure centre developed on the site, as well as two accommodation blocks, which originally generated additional income for the school.John Wentworth, a DET trustee, told MPs the assets – the leisure centre and accommodation – were still generating £400,000 a year but “most” of the money was going towards Martin’s severance pay rather than going towards’ children’s education.“At the moment, we have a considerable liability to the previous executive headteacher of Durand Academy,” Wentworth told MPs, adding that the severance figure had been “considerably higher” but had been reduced after negotiations between Martin and the Charity Commission.Wentworth told MPs there were ongoing discussions between the DET and the Education and Skills Funding Agency about what would happen to the leisure centre and accommodation blocks. He said if the DET retained control they would be used in line with its charitable objectives “to support the wider education objectives of children in Lambeth and to support the children at the Van Gogh primary school”.The hearing offered some fascinating insights into the complexities of transferring schools from one trust to another. The Dunraven Educational Trust, which finally took over Durand, was given just 48 hours to make a decision after the Harris Federation pulled out, though Harris helpfully shared all the information gathered during its investigations. Nevertheless, committee chair Meg Hillier described it as “a 48-hour fire sale”.The hearing was also told about troubles at Bright Tribe, which ran 10 schools in the north and east of England which are now being rebrokered. The academies troubleshooter, Angela Barry, who was brought as interim chief executive, refused to give details about ongoing investigations but apologised for past failings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1579f1e8a53b6e9b58a478c4d9c28f2d5e9d62fc/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bb97e20037395a72419d5d798fcb7b2","title":"dont make gp appointment manage money universities advice helicopter parents","story":"As a father of five, Steve West, vice-chancellor of the University of West of England, knows all about parental anxiety. Yet he says parents whose offspring have started university must learn to listen from afar without judging – even if those young adults are experimenting with drugs or drinking heavily.University may be a door to adulthood, but the parents of today’s students have wedged their feet firmly inside. With parents keen to know that the £9,250-a-year tuition fees are being spent wisely, there is now an established culture of them attending open days. And new research shows that perfectionist parents, who have grown used to managing everything at school, are often not letting go of the reins at university. Some are even organising their offspring’s finances from their laptop at home and booking them doctors’ appointments.Instead of lamenting this trend, West’s university, based in Bristol, has decided to embrace it, giving parents more information and making them “part of the university team”. And with the government leaning on universities to step up their pastoral care, other institutions, including Winchester, Essex, Warwick and Leeds, are taking a similar approach.As of this year, UWE parents get regular newsletters, which flag up key points in the calendar when students might need more emotional support. They have parent web pages telling them where to go for university services, and their own phone line and email address to raise the alarm if they are worried about their children.West acknowledges that starting university can be an overwhelming time for parents as well as students. “But I tell them the last thing you should do is project your anxieties on to your kids. Don’t text them every five minutes. Give them the space to settle in,” he says.He believes the most important thing parents can do is empower their children to talk to them – but not to wade in with opinions, even in the face of alarming behaviour. “If they are taking drugs or drinking, get them to talk to you about it, but don’t be judgmental,” West says. “If you have concerns you can signpost them to us.”There are still clear boundaries, however. “We are clear that this is a different stage, and we are not going to be on the phone updating them all the time,” West says. “If your child doesn’t turn up for a few lectures we won’t be reporting that to you. But if there are signs they are becoming isolated or putting themselves in danger, we will.”Dominique Thompson, a student health consultant who worked as a GP at Bristol University for nearly 20 years, says many parents need guidance on what level of intervention is acceptable and some universities aren’t giving this. “Whatever we feel about parents being involved in university, the fact is that they are, so pushing against the tide is not going to work. Universities need to get ahead and shape that relationship.”Thompson says it is now common for parents to ring to book a GP appointment for their child at university. “You have to question that. It’s done with the best of intentions – they say ‘I’m helping out because he’s busy with lectures’. But this is part of life and they need to learn to handle it alone.”She tells parents that when they drop their children off at university for the first time they mustn’t make the bed. “This isn’t a hotel. And don’t take them to do a food shop. Just leave. They have to learn to do all these things.”Anne West, professor of education policy at the London School of Economics, and author of a new book on “helicopter parents” at university, says support varies widely. The parents of one student accepted that he was living on virtually nothing because he was determined to avoid taking out a student loan, she says. “But there were other parents who were making meals for their children to take back to university, and keeping track of what they were spending their money on.”Alan Percy, head of counselling at Oxford University and chair of the Heads of University Counselling Services group, says parents have been given “a distorting message” that being a good parent is all about removing life’s problems. Instead, he says, they should teach their children practical life skills “and giving them the emotional resilience to face the world without you.“Often students can feel overwhelmed by managing their lives. If their parents have structured everything, at university they are going to fall off a cliff. I would advise parents to explain to young people that there may be times when they feel lonely. Don’t deny that. They should say ‘of course it feels difficult and you miss your friends, but eventually these strangers will be the best friends you’ll have for life’.”Sue Firth, a psychologist based in Cambridgeshire, admits she had her own emotional struggle after dropping off her 18-year-old son and her 20-year-old daughter to start at different universities this autumn.“University is a very big transition for parents. If you’re still part of a couple that helps, but I’m orced and on my own. I spent weeks preparing myself,” she says. “I said to both children: ‘It’s important you understand that it’s not your fault or responsibility if I am lonely. I don’t want you to worry about me.’ They are starting the next chapter of their lives and must be allowed to do that.”She admits she isn’t sure how much she should still be trying to discipline from afar. “I’ve told them both this isn’t you at sixth form now and you can’t just mess around. If they are really struggling I’ll teach them about learning techniques.”Winchester University runs settling-in sessions for parents when they drop their children off for freshers’ week. Dr Nicola Barton, director of student support services, says parents are “allies” in ensuring students are happy. “I will always listen to a parent’s concerns. Some may be over-protective, but I respect that they have known their children for 18 years and if they express concerns, I take notice,” she says.Jacqueline Stevenson, head of research at Sheffield Hallam University’s Institute of Education, studied how much engagement students at her university and Sheffield University had with their parents and was taken aback by how much close contact many still had.“Parents in many cases were vital, because they were giving this overwhelming message of ‘keep going, you’re doing really well, we’ve got your back’. Some students were getting that sort of one-to-one mentoring every single day,” she says.Stevenson says students did not regard this support as “smothering”. She argues that universities need to work harder to spot students who don’t have an emotional cheerleader, who might need someone at the university to step in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f4d296fe0524957a00d6bc0d4af9f893db0dcb0/0_172_5526_3316/master/5526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c4bb3c2ae9e492637e1d1e0bea1047","title":"price beer pink milk why not cost educating child laura mcinerney","story":"The underlying problem with the schools funding crisis is no one has calculated precisely how much schools needMargaret Thatcher famously knew the price of milk. David Cameron had crib sheets showing the cost of beer in Sheffield and London. But does any politician know the price of a primary or secondary education?School budgets are squeezed, with some headteachers so cash-strapped they have taken to closing at Friday lunchtime to help balance the books. Others have protested on the streets of London.Yet the underlying problem is that no one knows how much the schools system needs. In the past five years I’ve sat in umpteen dinners with MPs and philanthropists who loudly proclaim that the public purse simply can’t stand an ever-increasing budget for schools. “It’s just too expensive,” they say, “it must be possible to run schools more efficiently.” What no one says out loud is that to them, efficiently really means more cheaply, which translates into fewer teachers, on lower pay, with fewer resources.When Philip Hammond insulted the entire teaching profession by offering £400m for “little extras” in the budget – a lower amount than was given to potholes – it was fair enough for Labour to complain. But how much more ought he to have provided and what would it buy? The teacher unions are pushing for an injection of at least £2bn, but that figure appears to be cited on the basis of no more than that it would take schools back to 2015 funding levels. Why is that the bar? If more money is needed, a positive case should be made for what it will be spent on and why. “It’s what we did in the past,” is lazy politics.Now, the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who also leads parliament’s education committee, has broken ranks and called on the government to stop the uncertainty and create a 10-year funding plan for education. After all, if the NHS can do it, why can’t schools?Though it may be difficult to work out how much a school place ought to cost, it can’t be impossible, given that the country regularly manages it for higher education. Universities can charge £9,250 per student. The government sees this as the reasonable cost of educating an undergraduate. Should anyone point out that the figure seems high, given that schools educate children for at least six hours every weekday for around half that cost, the universities will quickly point to a plethora of other services they provide – mental health support, libraries, science equipment. Fair enough. But if it’s possible for universities to put a unified price on the delivery of “top quality service”, it must be possible for schools, too.The Labour party should lean in to this problem and resist the temptation always simply to argue that more is better. Imagine if the nebulous promise of their National Education Service became a specific funding commitment of, say, £6,000 for every person, every year, between the age of five and 21. When a student is in school, or college, or university, or with a private training provider, the cash would be used to cover their course. If they don’t use the whole pot – perhaps they have a gap year or go into paid employment – the cash sits in their account, redeemable at a later point. To support lifelong learning, Labour could top up the accounts. A mid-career bonus at 45, perhaps? Another at retirement?The £6,000 is illustrative, of course. The fact remains that we don’t actually know how much a good education costs in Britain. A pint of milk is about 50p. A beer in London costs £5.19. How should we figure out the real cost of a secondary school place? We need a price list.

And as soon as we start talking, she is making me wonder why I chose to focus on the arts and humanities at school. Were my teachers influenced by gender stereotypes or was I? Will more women consider going into technology in the future?Black, recently appointed professor in computer science and “technology evangelist” at Durham University, speaks with passion about encouraging women to study and teach computer science.She is very excited about her new job, which she started last week. “My focus will be on women in technology and helping to increase the number of women studying, researching and working in Durham computer science.“At the moment, most technologies are created by men – and, you know, the users of technology aren’t all men,” she says dryly. “We need the people who create the technology to reflect the makeup of society.”Black has won her achievements the hard way. Her mother died when she was 12 and, after her father remarried, she left home at 16, dropping out of her grammar school with no A-levels. She married at 20 and became a stay-at-home mother at 25, she sought shelter in a women’s refuge with her three small children. “I remember the first morning after I arrived, being sick in the gutter. And then I somehow thought it was going to be all right. I was so glad to be out of that environment where someone was giving me grief.”By the age of 26, she was a single mother, living in a council flat, nursing a burning desire to return to education. “I’ve always loved learning. I was reading dictionaries and encyclopedias from the age of four or five.” She decided to take a polymaths evening course at Southwark College (now Lewisham Southwark College) and has never forgotten how out of place she felt.“I had big bushy dyed black afro hair and wore biker jackets, Doc Martens and miniskirts. I walked into this room full of blokes in suits and thought: what have I done?”It did not stop her, though. “I really wanted to create a better life for my kids. With this course, I could do a lot of study at home. I had three small kids and with only six hours a week in the classroom, I only had to get a babysitter twice a week.”Black came top of her class, then did a degree in computing at London South Bank University and, in 2001, a PhD in software engineering. She went on to various academic roles and became head of the department of information and software systems at the University of Westminster.In 2010 she started her own consultancy. She famously led the campaign to save Bletchley Park and founded BCSWomen, an online network for women in tech, along with #techmums, a social enterprise that offers mothers free courses to build up their technology skills.Two years ago she was given an OBE by the Queen for her services to technology. She’s now a government adviser and is widely recognised as one of the most influential women in IT. These days she often gets asked for advice by women working in and studying tech who are being bullied, belittled or passed over for promotion – and when I ask her whether, as a female academic, she has personally experienced this, she answers yes without hesitation.Being bullied has been the hardest thing in her career, she says. Her jocular demeanour disappears as she talks about these experiences, and she looks upset. “Someone’s making your life difficult. You don’t really know why, they are just screwing things up for you. My approach has always been to talk to them first, maybe it’s a misunderstanding. Then go up the chain.“I guess I am a survivor. All I know is that I’ve kept doing things that have scared me over the years, and luckily for me, it has worked out.”She says there are days she feels that the world is full of dinosaurs. Universities need to do more to support and encourage female academics, she says, especially those working in male-dominated Stem subjects: “You need someone at the top of the university to think ‘this is an issue and we need to do something about it’.”Her first step at Durham is to research how universities around the world are encouraging women to study and teach computer science. Making sure her female students have good female role models is likely to be important. “I feel women are missing out on opportunities because they don’t realise what an exciting career it can be.”Lower down the education ladder, she has ideas for encouraging girls in school to think about technology as relevant to their lives. If she were in charge of the curriculum, technology wouldn’t even be a subject. “There should be technology in every lesson where it’s appropriate. That’s the place that it should have.” She would, though, like schools to replace technology lessons with programming, artificial intelligence and data science.“We need to change our culture to relate to each other better, so we don’t have to fit into stereotypes,” she says. “At the moment, our whole culture in the UK is misogynist.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aba306044d6e23fa81ce7b6a58407f3ed2148cfe/85_510_3907_2344/master/3907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8650709f84ac1a6c920adceda4da1ef5","title":"virgil van dijk netherlands germany nations league republic ireland denmark","story":"Virgil van Dijk scored a last-minute equaliser with a fierce volley against already relegated Germany in Gelsenkirchen on Monday night to secure the Netherlands a week in Portugal next June for the finals of the Nations League.The Dutch rallied after Quincy Promes pulled a goal back with five minutes remaining and set up a nervous finale for Germany, who had dominated throughout and looked good value for their 2-0 lead, a result which would have sent France through as group winners.

What’s behind the trend, and can exercise really change your shape?The hottest gym in LA right now is Bünda: Portuguese slang for bum, the “home of the better butt” – a gym entirely dedicated to working your posterior. It promises a “total body change”: “Once you Bünda, you will never look back … well, maybe for a selfie.”The trend has hit UK gyms, too, with a number now offering a range of classes focused only on glutes, from “BadAss” to the “Kylie Butt Lift” – named after Minogue, not Jenner. But it is the rise and rise of Jenner and the Kardashian family, whose bottoms have grown with their bank balances, that has led to a seismic shift in workout culture. While many women have, of course, always taken pride in well developed glutes, the emphasis on a firm, or “juicy”, bottom has now overtaken the flat stomach as the fitness holy grail in mainstream women’s health magazines.Instagram is the biggest platform for the trend, with #squats having reached 16.3m mentions and #glutes 4.6m as fitness influencers such as Tammy Hembrow and Katya Elise Henry profit from millions of followers wanting to know how to achieve their own butt transformations. With the Kardashians’ big bums and tiny waists the beauty benchmark for many young women, despite their multiple rumoured surgical enhancements, fitness trainers are finding that their clients increasingly approach them with unrealistic demands.“People bring me a photo of the bum they want, and I have to say: ‘OK, let me talk you through the picture’,” says personal trainer Kelechi Okafor. “They did not do this from training. These people manage to have humungous backsides, but their thighs, hamstrings and calf muscles are non-existent. I’m having to take a step back from taking on so many clients because it is so draining dealing with people’s expectations.”Some fitness experts say the trend is not just about aesthetics, and endorse glute-activation warm-ups as the best way to start a workout and get the body firing on all cylinders. Pilates trainer Hollie Grant says any form of glute activation helps people to bring their pelvis back to a more neutral position. “Most people have lazy glutes because, when they are sitting down, it lengthens and stretches the glute muscle. That has the effect of switching it off.”Grant enthuses about the benefits of strong glutes in preventing knee injuries and back problems, and also for postnatal women whose gluteal muscles have lengthened during pregnancy as a result of the relaxin hormone. “Plus, when your glutes are firing, you’re quicker at running and more powerful at doing squats and deadlifts.”Jim Pate, head physiotherapist at the Centre for Health and Human Performance in London, agrees that getting our glutes active is positive. “Glute exercises such as squats, deadlifts and lunges are good because they are compound – meaning they use many muscle groups, including the core.”But both Grant and Pate warn that the idea of “spot training” to isolate and train just one part of the body is a fallacy. “Over-focusing on one muscle group is going to mean that other areas are neglected and will remain undeveloped or, worse, will deteriorate if neglected over time,” says Pate. “Imbalances in different muscle groups’ strengths that are used together can result in poor functional performance or injury. An all-round programme will result in better, more sustainable results than passing fads.”With all the focus on women’s bottoms, there is a small group of health professionals hoping for a positive impact on the less visible muscles in and around our glutes: the pelvic floor. Amal Hassan, a sports and exercise medicine doctor, is one of the founding members of the Pelvic Floor Patrol, which aims to improve health services for women with pelvic floor dysfunction.“Your glutes support your pelvic floor,” she says. “So if you’re at risk of pelvic floor dysfunction and you’re not firing your glutes in functional movements – so sitting to stand, going upstairs – those deep pelvic muscles can become tight and cause pelvic pain, pain on sex, or propagate symptoms of incontinence or prolapse through weakness.” Even so, glute activation can be difficult to achieve, and Hassan advises using a resistance band to pinpoint the correct muscles.Additionally, she says, postnatal women should first prime the pelvic floor – by exhaling and lifting the muscles – before attempting loaded glute work such as weighted squatting, deadlifting, or even standing in the saddle at a spin class. Untucking the bottom can also help with posture.Okafor is dismissive of the idea this is a “body positive” movement just because it allows for a few curves. “We’re told this trend is progressive and inclusive, but body shaming and fat shaming is still going on. It’s not as if now that bigger bums are in we’re embracing everybody. It’s only a particular aesthetic that’s acceptable. What is progressive about that? We’re just creating real-life Barbie dolls.”Both in the UK and the US, many black fitness professionals are angered by the fitness industry’s new interest in larger bottoms that has led to, for instance, tennis star Serena Williams – her body a product of her sporting talent and discipline – grossly caricatured, while the same attributes in white women are considered desirable. “Remember when Caroline Wozniacki stuck towels down her skirt making fun of Serena?” says Okafor. “When it’s on a black woman it’s something we all laugh at – ‘look at this barbaric woman with her big bum’ – but a non-black woman with the same body is profitable.” Chrissy King, a personal trainer and powerlifter based in Milwaukee, who blogs about intersectional fitness, says “It’s the profitability of this cultural appropriation that is the burn. White women have been able to take something that black women have always had, popularise it and make money from it when black women can’t.”So should we rush out and join an ass class? The fitness professionals agree that strong gluteals are important for a well-functioning body. But as King asks her clients: “Do you want a bigger butt because, societally, you think this will make you feel more accepted? To me, this just feels like another example of fitness capitalising on women’s insecurities about their bodies.”Like Okafor, King is battling the way society pressures women to exercise to look a certain way, rather than focusing on fitness and strength for health and functionality. She despairs of the approach of many personal trainers and fitness influencers on social media. “I see the same things all the time – fitness videos filmed at an angle that shows their butt from behind.” She laughs. “Personally, I film my squatting videos for technique. No one would ever judge a squat technique from behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

I was lying on a beanbag and a bit stoned when he walked in, all 6ft 8 of him. The ceiling was low anyway, so I thought I was hallucinating, but we clicked. After we left university we DJ-ed together for a little club night in London, called Captain Sensual at the Helm of the Groove Armada.When we started making music, we packed a sampler and a keyboard and rented a little old house in Ambleside in the Lake District to write an album in a week. On the last day there we picked up a Sounds of the 1950s compilation from a 50p bargain bin in the local shop. That’s where the vocal sample on At the River comes from – it’s Patti Page singing Old Cape Cod. We sampled her singing, “If you’re fond of sand dunes and salty air, quaint little villages here and there…”, slowed a breakbeat right down to get a lazy feel, and made a bass sound with the keyboard. Not using the rest of the original song’s lyrics left our song open to conjecture, giving it a slightly eerie, melancholy quality. I’d love to say it was a stroke of genius, but the truth is we could only fit 10 seconds of her singing in the sampler.Andy and I argue to this day about who wrote the distinctive trombone riff. I think I sang it, Andy thinks he played it spontaneously, but either way we were in a room and the riff came out. We must have made the whole tune in about two hours, but then Rob da Bank made it his tune of the week in DJ Magazine and it started to take off. The initial pressing was just 500 seven-inch singles on Tummy Touch Records. As I was driving down to the record-cutting plant, a car drove into the back of me. My back wheel ended up on his bonnet. I was leaning forwards with the tape in my hand. I was in shock, but all I could think was: “We’ve got to get this to the cutting plant!”It was a fluke that I had my trombone with me. I had a jazz gig coming up, so I took it up to the Lakes with me to practise. Before I saw DJ Sasha play and had an epiphany with house music, I’d been a trombonist in the Grimethorpe Colliery Band in Yorkshire. One of the miner’s cottages belonged to this bloke who was a sort of guru to all the area’s brass players. He said: “You’re not bad but you’ve got no diaphragm.” He made me lie on the floor so he could jump up and down on my stomach. You’d never get away with that now, but I did play better afterwards. My dad was a trombone player too, and the blues lick in At the River came from a spiritual we played together, also called At the River, so the title is a nod to those sessions with my dad.The trombone melody just came to me when I was blowing over the chord sequence with the equipment set up on the dining table, before we started recording. I wanted to make a recording of it just so I could remember it, but we didn’t have a microphone. The house was in the middle of nowhere, so I made one out of the cottage’s hi-fi system, by swapping the wires around in an Alba speaker. I expected it to sound shit, but it gave the sound a real vintage character, so we put it on the record. While we were recording, news of Princess Diana’s death came on the radio. I don’t know if that added to the melancholy feel.Rob da Bank gave our seven-inch to Zoe Ball, and she started playing it on the Radio 1 breakfast show. Then the playlist committee said it was “too slow for radio”. Luckily, various producers played it anyway, and there was such positive feedback from the listeners it ended up on the playlist. Our careers took off from there. It’s funny, when we left Ambleside, we were in two vehicles, so we made two copies of At the River “just in case” anything happened to one of us on the journey. I guess we had a feeling that it was a special tune."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e44dc10db4a71291fb943ceeba67d7a20343a0/0_141_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edb28840f19a8062635a0904aa02ce24","title":"poverty in britain a social calamity","story":"As part of his field work for a damning report into poverty in the UK, Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur, visited Newcastle where he found people struggling to negotiate the benefits system and going hungry.

We are not so proud that we don’t think we can learn as we try to adjust universal credit for the benefit of everybody. But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying.”She added: “But we look forward to working with experts in the area, to make sure we get the right outcome for the people who we want to look after.”Asked about the tone of the UN report, May’s spokesman said: “We strongly disagree with the analysis.”More generally on universal credit, which is designed to replace six separate benefits but which charities and councils have warned is overly complex and often puts new claimants into debt, Rudd struck a more conciliatory note. She promised to try to improve the system but offered no new policy specifics.Asked by the SNP’s Neil Gray to use her influence in cabinet to listen to charities and halt the rollout of the system, Rudd replied: “I wouldn’t want to overstate what the honourable gentleman calls my power, but I am certainly going to listen very carefully.“Part of the benefit of the universal credit rollout is going to be making sure we get the expert guidance from the people who have been working in this field for many years – and we will certainly be doing it.”In response to another question on claimants’ access to emergency payments to tide them over as they move to universal credit, Rudd said: “We have already made some adjustments to that and I will make sure that I do all I can to ensure that we do better.”She promised to deliver “a fair, compassionate and efficient benefits system”, adding: “But I know there are problems with universal credit, despite its good intentions. I’ve seen them for myself. I will be listening and learning from the expert groups in this area who do such good work. I know it can be better. I will make sure it is my role to deliver that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78a6b91fc7821d76ab432cae63c13dc57b5fb717/853_42_2005_1203/master/2005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131e8832eb4b20957a919e68f71e7169","title":"energy minister claire perry accused of swearing and shouting at staff unions civil servants","story":"Unions write to top official at BEIS department saying claims were raised by civil servantsTrade unions have written to the top official in the business department to raise concerns about claims that the energy minister, Claire Perry, has sworn and screamed at civil servants, the  understands.Representatives of three unions representing Whitehall officials wrote a joint letter to Alex Chisholm, permanent secretary at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), citing wider concerns about the behaviour of its ministers.The letter, from the PCS, FDA and Prospect unions, said the claims had been raised by BEIS staff, but that the unions could not detail specific instances owing to concerns that iniduals involved could be identified.They singled out the alleged behaviour of Perry, claiming there had been a series of reports about her alleged behaviour towards her civil servants.It is understood that the complaints given to the unions include claims that Perry screamed and shouted, texted one civil servant to say “Fuck off”, and wrote, “What’s this shit?” on a memo produced by staff. The MP for Devizes became energy minister in June last year, a role that involves attending cabinet.The letter, sent earlier this month, has not been made public, and the unions involved have declined to comment.Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, urged the department to act on the letter. “The unions have raised serious allegations, and we’ve got to look into them carefully,” he said.“All ministers, however important, must pay close attention to relations with their staff, and avoid any conduct that could be seen as unprofessional. Bullying is totally unacceptable in any workplace.”In January, the government updated the official code for ministerial conduct, featuring an expanded section on bullying and harassment.The code says ministers’ working relationships with civil servants and others “should be proper and appropriate”.It continues: “Harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the ministerial code and will not be tolerated.”A spokesman for BEIS said: “Like all government departments we are committed to ensuring that our staff are treated with respect. We have clear codes of conduct in place, with high standards expected of all.“Any complaints or grievances made by staff are investigated following agreed internal processes.”BEIS had no specific response to the claims raised but noted that the results of staff surveys showed it was among the best-performing Whitehall departments for the fair treatment of staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37fb90cf8d560bc3caa9f9f0497e81de0f1d6879/0_1_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6362218fbc09cead5a2abc6d9de3a3cf","title":"treasury promises to publish brexit deal analysis","story":"Party voted with Labour against finance bill in warning shot to Theresa MayThe government has “seriously broken” its commitment to the Democratic Unionist party, which forced its MPs to vote with Labour, one of its senior MPs has said, throwing the future of Theresa May’s government into further doubt.Sammy Wilson, the party’s Brexit spokesman, said the government had not stuck to its promise that Northern Ireland would not be treated differently from the rest of the UK in the Brexit withdrawal agreement.“Since the government has not honoured its side of the bargain we tonight tried to spell out some of the consequences of that,” Wilson told the BBC.The DUP, whose 10 votes May relies on for a majority in parliament, abstained or backed Labour in a series of votes on the budget.The DUP’s fury about the prime minister’s Brexit deal, and its decision to withhold support from the finance bill raised doubts about the future of the confidence and supply arrangement on which May’s ability to secure a majority is based.Wilson, said the government had reneged on its promises, and “consequences were inevitable”.“The prime minister has undermined her own authority with her own party and with our party by blatantly breaking promises about what she would deliver in the Brexit deal with the European Union,” he said.The prime minister turned to the DUP in June last year when her majority was wiped out in the general election.The agreement the two parties subsequently signed, and which led to more than £1bn of extra resources being directed to Northern Ireland, said the DUP would support the government on “all motions of confidence and on the Queen’s Speech the Budget finance bills money bills, supply and appropriation legislation and estimates”.After it emerged that the DUP had abandoned the Conservatives on a series of issues, including a Labour motion on child poverty, Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: “We no longer have a functioning government. With Brexit only a few months away, something has got to give.”DUP sources suggested the decision to withhold their support was a shot across the bows of the government, rather than a signal that the confidence and supply deal is in abeyance.None of the opposition amendments passed and the DUP could still opt to support the budget at later stages of the legislative process. But, without the DUP’s support, May would find passing any contentious legislation in the coming weeks impossible, and the gesture underlined the depth of the party’s frustrations about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.Arlene Foster’s party has pledged to vote against May’s deal when she brings it back to the House of Commons, which is likely to be early next month.The DUP objects in particular to the Irish backstop, which it argues would keep Northern Ireland in the regulatory orbit of the EU – and in a different regime to the rest of the UK.The government had to cave in on the issue of cutting the stakes for addictive fixed-odds betting machines, which prompted the resignation of the sports minister Tracey Crouch, after the threat of a backbench revolt on the finance bill.In a fresh concession on Monday night, the Treasury minister, Robert Jenrick, announced that the government would publish economic analysis of remaining in the EU, alongside its projections for the government’s Brexit deal, before MPs vote on it.Jenrick’s concession, made during the debate, came after a cross-party amendment tabled by Labour’s Chuka Umunna and the Conservative Anna Soubry, secured the backing of 11 Conservative MPs – more than enough to wipe out May’s majority, even without DUP backing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f4f6972deb6546c282471d29d95ef5a36963f9c/0_0_2895_1738/master/2895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf18c3586224f8aae6eec6786eba070","title":"space how far have we gone and where are we going","story":"Billionaire entrepreneurs are trying to create rockets fit for human travel, while government agencies spend billions furthering their explorations. But we are still a long way off from making our way to the red planetSpace flight is now a venerable industry. Humanity’s first space explorer, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, orbited around the globe on 12 April 1961, more than half a century ago, when Britain remained a colonial power and people were still using halfpennies to buy their fish and chips.Since then, more than 550 people have blasted themselves into the deep black abyss, although not all agree on how far up you need to go until you hit space, so there is no internationally accepted figure. Only a 10th of those have been women, in big part due to sexist policies by Nasa and Russia’s Roscosmos space agency.The Soviet Union pulled ahead with the first space walks, but US president John F Kennedy’s announcement that America would put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s focused the space race squarely on that goal. Apollo 11 touched down on our dusty grey neighbour on 20 July 1969.A total of 12 men walked on the moon over the next few years, all Americans, but no one has been back there since 1972. In fact, no one has left the outskirts of the Earth since then.We imagine astronauts floating in free space or bouncing in moon craters, yet the majority of those lucky enough have instead spun around in low Earth’s orbit – between 99 and a few hundred miles high. That’s where the vast array of communications and navigation satellites live, speeding at thousands of miles an hour to avoid plummeting back to earth.Even though we did not go back to deep space, humans have begun to live and work outside the Earth’s atmosphere, often conducting experiments on themselves to determine the effects of weightlessness, or microgravity, on the human body.By 1986, the Soviet Union had launched the Mir space station. When it eventually fell to Earth (thankfully unoccupied) and burned up, our current space outpost, the International Space Station (ISS), was launched. Since 2000, humans have been living in space constantly. There are three up there at the moment, speeding around the globe once every 90 minutes.A lot, and until we properly understand how weightlessness affects humans, we won’t be able to send this era’s pioneers further afield to places such as Mars or wandering asteroids. Scott Kelly, a US former fighter pilot and long-time Nasa astronaut, spent a year bouncing around the cramped capsules of the ISS in an attempt to understand the long-term impact of space flight. He doesn’t hold the record for the most extended foray into the void – that is claimed by Gennady Padalka, who spent two and half years of his life up there on several missions – but the Kelly experiment had a natural advantage over others: he has a twin.Comparing their bodies throughout, scientists were able to assess how bones, muscles and other parts of the body deteriorate in space. There is even a gym on the ISS where astronauts can keep their muscles – no longer needed to prop them up – from slowly wasting away. But they need to wear a harness to keep them from floating off the treadmill. One big issue is that eye problems develop, but Kelly found his body recovered fast on return. He and his twin seemed in similar shape – good news for future deep space missions.Only three countries, China, Russia and the US, have human space programmes as it remains prohibitively expensive. However, they have provided lifts for space travellers from 40 countries, including a member of the Saudi royal family and even paying customers, such as South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, aged just 28.Astronomical. The ISS is the most expensive machine ever constructed with a price tag at around $150bn (£115bn). Nasa’s space shuttle programme, which kicked off in the early 1970s by promising safe and affordable access to space, hoped to cost just a few tens of million dollars per launch. But as the shuttle was thrown in the scrapyard in 2011, the agency estimated the total cost at $209bn — nearly $1.6bn per flight.Following the big fight over the shuttle, which looked fantastic but also restricted space adventuring to Earth’s orbit as well as costing a fortune, the US took a side seat in launches. Most astronauts are now sent by the Russian space agency, which sells round-trip rides on its Soyuz spacecraft for between $21m and $82m.Anyone involved in space travel will scoff at this, but it’s a good question, and space agencies often don’t communicate their achievements enough. Almost every sector of human progress has benefited from sending people into space. Just the act of attempting the feat forced scientists to invent new systems. The Apollo guidance computer was a predecessor to the microcomputer, now found in all smartphones. Clothes are more fire-resistant because of research on space fires. Remotely monitoring the health of astronauts has led to revolutionary systems for helping patients on Earth. Diseases behave and develop differently in microgravity, which assists scientists in finding cures.The first space race was part of the chest-beating of the cold war, but since then human space exploration has been more about countries working together than against each other. The ISS is a massive collaboration between five space agencies (Nasa, Roscosmos, Japan’s Jaxa, the pan-European agency ESA and the Canadian Space Agency) and was assembled over a period of 13 years from 1998, slowly adding capsules like Lego.A big exception to this is China, which has gone it alone with its space ambitions, never sending an astronaut to the ISS. In 2006, Beijing reportedly tested lasers against US imaging satellites in what appeared to be an attempt to blind or damage them, and US lawmakers later banned cooperation between Nasa and China’s state agency.However, the future of any effective human space flight is certainly likely to be cooperative rather than antagonistic. Since 2011, national spaces agencies in 14 countries have attempted to coordinate their dreams into a single vision. The most recent plan, published in January this year, said they had agreed to “expand human presence into the solar system, with the surface of Mars as a common driving goal”.Don’t start the countdown just yet. To get to Mars, most people in the human space flight community feel we need to first go back to the moon. “It’s the only logical step,” says Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck, University of London. “I’m all in favour of sending people to Mars, but the technology, competence, the experience – I think it’s still out of reach”.The moon has several advantages. It’s only three days away, rather than a several-month round trip to Mars, and has been touted as a location for a research station similar to the one in Antarctica. From their celestial laboratory, scientists could study the impact of radiation exposure and near-weightlessness on the body at a closer distance to Earth, but still within deep space, all while preparing for trips further afield.Well. Not quite either. The Global Exploration Roadmap suggests first building a space station as an orbital base from which to send astronauts back and forth to the moon. This will look similar to the ISS except, instead of rushing around the Earth, it will orbit the moon.It is a mammoth feat and it would be wise to expect serious delays. “Where we go in space is decided by a combination of what people would like to do and the reality of time and budgets,” says Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, Washington DC, and a former policy analyst at Nasa. “The idea of putting people on Mars has been around for a long time. If you read the policies, it is clearly a long-term vision without a date. But we probably are still lacking the technology to keep people for a long time in deep space.”The US and Russia have been giving way to new players. In 2003, China became the third country to put a person into orbit and India plans to follow in 2022. But the sector-changing impact is undoubtedly coming from the private space.In what is being coined the “billionaire’s space race”, Elon Musk, founder of Telsa electric cars, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Virgin boss Richard Branson all want to send private citizens to space. Their companies, SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, are set on making human space travel cheaper.They join a handful of commercial space flight companies that already work as contractors for national space agencies. Aerospace industry titans Boeing and Lockheed Martin send heavy launchers into space, but that costs at least $350m per launch – several times more expensive than SpaceX’s new $90m Falcon Heavy system.SpaceX has around $10bn worth of launches already booked and saves costs through reusable spacecraft, where even the rocket boosters land themselves back on the ground and can be dusted off for reuse.And while it is looking increasingly likely that the ISS will be defunded in the next decade, several private ventures are considering either taking over or rebuilding their own space stations.As government agencies prioritise the moon, others are looking straight at Mars. Musk has said his life goal is to create a thriving Mars colony as a fail-safe for humanity in case of a catastrophic event on Earth, such as a nuclear war or Terminator-style artificial intelligence coup. For this, SpaceX is developing the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which he claims could send crewed flights to the red planet by mid-2020.Musk says the BFR is partly inspired by Tintin’s rocket and will be the biggest ever made at close to 40 storeys high and capable of ferrying as many as 100 passengers per trip, depending on how much luggage they want to put in the hold.As well as a healthy satellite launch business, SpaceX is raising money by selling tickets on the BFR for a trip, some would say a jolly, around the moon. Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese fashion billionaire and art collector, is funding such a mission slated for 2023 and says he is going to invite artists with him for the week-long trip to re-engage the public in the wonder of our universe.An astronaut’s guide to life on Earth, Chris HadfieldTo space and back, Sally RideEndurance: A year in space, a lifetime of discovery, Scott Kelly"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645d9cecf23bc49f7db5501019ba26865db3645c/0_345_6641_3987/master/6641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd59d995a11dda3710ebcf797a22862a","title":"are you affected by alopecia areata share your experiences","story":"A new  photography project aims to empower those living with the condition.

For England’s women, now at the business end of their World T20 campaign, they could do well with this also applying for Anya Shrubsole. Dominating with the ball through England’s pool games, her career-high 29, compiled in a 55-run partnership with Sophia Dunkley, was the only reason Heather Knight’s side made a fist of their final group game against West Indies after the top order misfired.Until Sunday Shrubsole had more wickets than runs to her name in T20 internationals, but she set that straight in an innings that showed the resourcefulness and confidence expected from a player of far greater numerical stature with the bat.“We’re obviously very disappointed,” she said of the loss, after West Indies’ winning runs were struck with only three balls to go. “Especially when we’d got ourselves back into a position where we could have won.”A late dropped catch by Fran Wilson when England were rallying, along with a series of errant throws, ensures fielding will be a focus between now and their semi-final against India on Thursday in Antigua. Shrubsole acknowledged that the heaving St Lucian crowd played their role well by heaping on the pressure. “Deandra Dottin and Shemaine Campbelle put some pressure back on us and in that atmosphere it was hard to deliver as calmly and consistently as we would have liked.”Not least the approach of Dunkley, who top-scored with 35 from 30 balls in her first innings for England. “Sophia played brilliantly,” Shrubsole said. “It’s a difficult position to bat, No 7, because you either come in when your side needs quick runs or when they’re struggling. She showed great composure and she played some really nice shots. What was most pleasing was she didn’t just go into her shell, she looked to take the front-foot option. On another day it would have been a match-winning innings.”In much the same way Shrubsole’s initial spell with the ball also deserved to have been match-defining. In her opening over the attack leader cut through the gate of Hayley Matthews then swung past the bat of the West Indies captain, Stafanie Taylor – two superb pieces of bowling to remove two fine players.“It was a bit like the wickets against South Africa,” the vice-captain said of the hat-trick she claimed in the previous fixture. “I just look to bowl full, straight and threaten the stumps and it went my way in those early overs.”Looking ahead, Shrubsole believes comfort can be found in how well England know the India side that topped Pool B – most memorably, having defeated them in last year’s World Cup final.“We know all about them,” she said in praising their strengths, especially the form of Smriti Mandhana who in this year’s Kia Super League struck a competition-leading 421 runs at a remarkable strike rate of 174. The opener was also player of the match in India’s win over Australia on Saturday, stroking a flawless 83 off 55 balls.But, drawing on her own academic studies in psychology, Shrubsole knows that a preoccupation with an adversary is a gateway to failure.“We need to focus on ourselves though,” she said. “Every team is dangerous at this point of the tournament and we need to go into the game confident of performing as well as we can.

This is what you love so much about the game.”The Coliseum’s first Monday night game since 1985 was worth the wait – and if this fascinating spectacle turns out to be a Super Bowl preview, Atlanta should prepare for an All-Madden-level show from two of the most exciting teams in the league.“It was one of the most competitive games I’ve been a part of,” McVay said. “It was just a competitive game with a lot of high-caliber football in all three phases.”Rams linebacker Samson Ebukam returned a fumble and an interception for the first two TDs of his NFL career, while Kansas City’s Allen Bailey returned Goff’s fumble for a go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter.The second half was an extended thriller featuring 59 combined points, but the Rams made slightly more big plays down the stretch.After Goff led a 75-yard scoring drive in 89 seconds for the go-ahead TD to Everett, former Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters intercepted Mahomes’ underthrown ball near midfield with 1:18 to play.The Rams only managed to get 14 seconds off the clock on their next three plays, and the Coliseum roiled in anticipation of a big finish by Mahomes. But the Chiefs were pushed back to their 13 with 50 seconds left thanks to a booming punt by Johnny Hekker, and Joyner intercepted Mahomes’ final desperate heave with 13 seconds left.This game has loomed in capital letters on the NFL’s regular season schedule ever since these teams confirmed their status as offensive powerhouses in September. Along with New Orleans and New England, the Rams and Chiefs are the league’s biggest favorites for long postseason runs.But before January, these offensive powerhouses put on a show for a prime-time audience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d5013ffc525ec460422cf8da187d9c0e0775bd/468_82_2591_1554/master/2591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2aa054e2a0d05eaa41f6b97d3bdfbee3","title":"mo farah to run 2019 london marathon 2020 olympics","story":"• Farah finished third in London race in 2018• ‘I can compete against the best marathon runners in the world’Mo Farah has confirmed that he will run in the 2019 London marathon as he continues his preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.In his first year as a dedicated marathon runner, Farah finished third in this year’s race in a British record time of 2hr 6min 21sec, behind the world record holder Eliud Kipchoge.The 35-year-old then ran 70 seconds faster to win the Chicago marathon in October – his first victory over 26.1 miles – in a new European record time of 2:05.11.Afterwards Farah promised he could have “gone a lot faster” and suggested that a low 2:04 or high 2:03 was in his grasp. That is still way behind Kipchoge’s world record of 2:01.39, set in Berlin in September, but it would give him a serious chance of adding a fifth Olympic medal to his four from London 2012 and Rio 2016.“I feel I have made great strides in the past year, finishing third in London in April, and winning my first major marathon in Chicago in October,” said Farah. “That and breaking both the British and European records has given me the confidence that I can compete against the best marathon runners in the world.“London always puts together a world-class field and I expect that will be exactly the same in 2019 and I can’t wait for the challenge.”Farah is yet to announce whether he will run the marathon at the 2019 world championships in Doha next October, with suspicions growing that he will make a shock return to the track to run in the 10,000m at the same event.However his coach, Gary Lough, said after Farah’s Chicago victory that he “might change things up a bit next year and surprise a few people”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7f9cd825c11c77f29afeae0dbd24332d0ed4d48/185_1829_3321_1993/master/3321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87abd6a85b475606a85ffb314ce76ea0","title":"comedy duos lazy susan norris and parker soho theatre london","story":"Sharing bedrooms and backstage nerves, Lazy Susan and Norris \u0026amp Parker reveal the intertwined lives of the double actFreya Parker: We started out as a trio called Lebensmüde. It was such a mistake to have a name no one can pronounce – or spell! Schadenfreude was already taken.I’d been doing a fringe play with my friend Ed who thought Celeste and I would get along. The three of us set out to write theatre together. The results were really worthy, just needlessly bleak. We booked a scratch night in Peckham. As it rapidly approached, we thought we couldn’t do this awful play about two little boys in a bunker. Instead, we did some sketches and jokes, then went to Edinburgh as a trio in 2013. After Ed went back into academia, Celeste and I did another Edinburgh – as Lazy Susan – and we got nominated for the comedy award.We spend an enormous amount of time together. In Edinburgh, we share a room and it’s quite intense. As soon as you open your eyes in the morning it’s like: “Hey! It’s me again! Hello!” In the first week of the festival, you’re up until the small hours every night rewriting.When we’re creating a show we’ll each come in with a scrap of an idea, a draft of a sketch or a character. We put music on and shoot the shit. We record ourselves improvising on our phones or jot things down. Friends have said to me: “Don’t put that in a sketch!” You can’t help but put your own life into your comedy but we’d never humiliate someone without their consent.Celeste and I find the same things funny, but my sense of humour is maybe a bit more surreal. I’m definitely the weirder one.Celeste Dring: Freya and I have got to a point now where we don’t take ourselves too seriously. There are jokes I can write about Freya that I feel she can take. We wanted to put more of ourselves into our new show. Freya is hyper-vigilant, and a few years ago I’d have felt like it was a criticism to draw attention to it. But the beginnings of this show were her hyper-vigilance and a joke about me being a bit sleazy. We wanted to write about fear and gender and make it personal to us.We started out doing comedy a bit tentatively because we were so bad at theatre. I’m quite terrified by how little I understand our process. You never feel like you really know how to do it. We usually work at Freya’s flat or mine. It’s important to be able to move around – we go outside and run about, do some stretching. If you’re in a coffee shop, you can get a bit too chatty. We wish we had a studio but we just can’t afford it.On acting jobs I’m quite spooked if people don’t have comedic impulses. Basically, what I’m saying is I get spooked if people don’t laugh at my jokes. I joke a lot in between takes because I’m so used to doing that in live comedy.I went on holiday for two weeks last year – that’s the longest I’ve gone without seeing Celeste. It’s just like being in a long-term relationship. We have to block in time off together where we’re not working – like a couple who have been married for a long time and have to schedule in sex. We’re going bowling next week, but that’s mostly to enjoy the hilarity of Freya’s overarm bowl.Katie Norris: We’re shackled together. Sinead says I’m her blood supply and she’s my albatross. We weren’t sure of each other when we met at drama school in Manchester. Sinead’s quite shy I was really ballsy and had a bad fake tan. We have the same birthday so were forced to plan a joint night out at Manchester’s Comedy Store where we watched loads of male standups. Sinead was horrified I thought they were really funny.We pushed the boundaries of our friendship quite early on, getting drunk and dancing to Kate Bush, taking our clothes off and running around to Wuthering Heights. After we moved in it became like Withnail and I. We bought a rabbit that roamed around the flat and shat on our cardboard cutout of David Cameron’s face.To write material we sometimes book an Airbnb. As I’m the responsible one, I do the driving and the cooking. Sometimes I accidentally spoon Sinead when we sleep in the same bed. We improvise, watch really dark documentaries, laugh together. When we’re writing, Sinead will sit with a laptop. If I could have a chaise longue I would.This year in Edinburgh I joined a spa and went there every day. Sinead couldn’t afford the spa and decided to become an agoraphobic. She stayed in bed for most of the day and only got up at 9pm for the show.Sinead Parker: Neither of us had done comedy before we got together. I did a one-woman show when Katie went to Keswick on a theatre job after drama school. I felt like a limb had been amputated. Katie talks about it as the best time of her life – she went running, didn’t really drink, got paid regularly. Meanwhile, I was going through a horrible breakup and doing a solo show. I perversely enjoy the fear of standup, thinking I’m going to absolutely bomb.We have a similarly cruel sense of humour. That’s how we bonded. Our boyfriends always find us really intimidating together because we’re a horrible combination. But we also like silliness and finding the absurdity in everyday things.I’d happily live with Katie now we’re both in London, but I think she’d like boundaries. We do have sleepovers. We take baths together, we poo in front of each other. Katie came with me once to a colposcopy. Before we go on stage, I always have to check Katie’s catsuit for wet patches.Our new show took longer to write than we’d expected. At the end of it, we had a song that made no sense and cut it after the first preview in Edinburgh. Then Katie had a fever dream that she wrote up as our ending.A compere once called us The Fertile Girls. Norris \u0026amp Parker is the most unimaginative name for a double act. As the more dominant one, Katie went first. But it has a better ring to it than Parker \u0026amp Norris.• Lazy Susan’s Forgive Me, Mother! is at Soho theatre, London, 18 December-5 January.

It was not clear what this would mean.Israel captured the West Bank from Jordanian forces in 1967 and continues to control and occupy the area, although Palestinians have limited self-rule over small enclaves.Ideologically driven Jewish nationalists who claim all of historic Palestine have since created outposts there, pushing out Palestinian residents. Today, more than half a million settlers live in what have become sprawling towns connected by a network of roads that cut up the West Bank.Settlements have long been seen as a critical barrier to a peace deal, which the international community broadly agrees should be two states side by side, one for Israelis and one for Palestinians.Activists have for years called for Airbnb and other companies to withdraw from the disputed territory, and Airbnb acknowledged it had “struggled to come up with the right approach”.Human Rights Watch welcomed the move. Arvind Ganesan, the business and human rights director at the organisation, said Airbnb’s decision was “an important recognition that such listings can’t square with its human rights responsibilities”.“For two years, Human Rights Watch has spoken with Airbnb about their brokering of rentals in West Bank settlements that are illegal under international humanitarian law and for which Palestinian ID holders are effectively barred from entering,” he said.The settlement movement has sought to encourage tourism in occupied land, with the help of the Israeli government, which established national parks there. A leaked European Union report said some projects were being used “as a political tool to … support, legitimise and expand settlements”.In 2016, Airbnb came under added scrutiny after it was revealed that its website listed settlement properties as being inside the state of Israel, and not the Palestinian territories.Husam Zomlot, a Palestinian diplomat, condemned the firm at the time, saying it was “promoting stolen property and land. There will come a time when companies like this, who profit from the occupation, will be taken to court.”On Monday, a senior Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, described Airbnb’s decision as an “initial positive step” but complained that it did not include East Jerusalem, which was also captured and occupied in the 1967 war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3ed0ab078c20e81c6f76e7a3cd4647c9e6642c0/0_221_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f33e56ecc1519a9667c0d5f19688b6a","title":"twitter ceo jack dorsey criticised for upsetting hindu nationals india visit","story":"Jack Dorsey accused of hate speech after posing with sign opposing country’s caste systemTwitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, has upset Hindu nationalists in India by posing for a picture with a placard reading: “Smash Brahminical patriarchy”.A top policy officer for the company apologised to angry users for the photograph, and told them neither Twitter nor Dorsey endorsed the sign’s message that the oppression of the Hindu caste system must be dismantled alongside male dominance.That, in turn, has angered Indian activists who oppose patriarchy and the caste system.Dorsey has been touring India, one of Twitter’s fastest growing markets, meeting figures including the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.Last weekend the Twitter chief held a roundtable with a group of journalists, writers and activists in Delhi to hear about their experiences on the website and app, which has been criticised for facilitating the abuse and harassment of prominent Indian women.Among the attendees to the off-the-record event was an activist belonging to the Dalit, a formerly “untouchable” caste that occupies the bottom rung of the intricate system that still determines the shape of most Hindu lives. understands the activist gave Dorsey the sign at the beginning of the closed-door session, and that he was still holding it at the end when the photograph was taken.It sparked anger among some Brahmins, who have been regarded as the highest caste, as well as from Hindu nationalists, who seek to downplay the religion’s fissures and unite adherents under a single cultural and political umbrella.Among the critics were senior journalists and business people, as well as prominent figures on the Hindu right.“I’m very sorry for this,” Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s legal and policy head told one user. “It’s not reflective of our views. We took a private photo with a gift just given to us – we should have been more thoughtful.“Twitter strives to be an impartial platform for all,” she added. “We failed to do that here \u0026amp we must do better to serve our customers in India.”That apology angered others, who argued Twitter should forthrightly oppose Brahminism, the system of beliefs and practices that perpetuates the place of Brahmins at the top of India’s social order.It was the latest misstep for a major Silicon Valley company in India, a frontier market where many technology firms have been focusing their resources as their customer bases in Europe, the US and Australia become saturated.India has about 330m smartphones in circulation, the second-most in the world, but it has the world’s largest offline population: more than 1 billion people in 2016, according to the World Bank. Hundreds of millions are expected to come online in the next decade.Twitter is estimated to currently have about 34.4 million active monthly users in the country.Facebook attempted to give away a free, limited version of the internet in villages across India in 2015. But the plan, called Free Basics, was criticised as “digital colonialism” and was found to violate net neutrality.Snapchat also faced a public relations storm when a disgruntled former employee claimed its CEO, Evan Spiegel, had said the app was “only for rich people” and that he did not want to “expand into poor countries like India”. The company denies Spiegel ever made the remarks.Twitter, on its official account, seemed to sum up the situation in a tweet on Monday night. “Awkward”, it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28b9ebfb4d5e9587f22efdf1cff08007a45948ba/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=914ac083e47e825ae570b091154954f4","title":"top filmmakers back penguin intervention on attenborough show","story":"Wildlife documentary experts defend crew’s decision to help trapped birdsLeading wildlife camera operators and film-makers have defended the film crew on David Attenborough’s latest BBC series over their decision to break with convention and intervene to save a group of penguins that had become trapped in a ravine.Nature film-makers are discouraged from intervening in the events they are attempting to capture on film. While the general principle is to avoid interfering with the natural course of events, the crew on the Dynasties series stepped in when they saw the birds’ predicament.The penguins at the centre of Sunday’s episode of Dynasties had either blown or tumbled into a gully in a storm and were unable to to get out. In what BBC Earth described as an “unprecedented move”, the crew dug a shallow ramp so some of the penguins would be able to use it to save themselves.But Allan said he saw no problem with the film crew’s intervention. “Interfering or not is a decision based on what you’re seeing at the time. To interfere on a predation event is definitely wrong but, in this situation, they didn’t spook the penguins. All they did was create an escape route for them,” he said. Allan explained it would have been a far more stressful situation for the penguins had the film crew decided to pick them up and move them.He added: “I certainly think, in that case, what they did was entirely justifiable and entirely understandable. I would have done the same thing in their situation.”Philip Hoare, author and film-maker, said the crew were bound to upset someone whichever way they responded. He said he found himself in a similar position when he was in Sri Lanka filming sperm whales. When a group of killer whales appeared to hunt the sperm whales, he realised his boat was in between the predator and prey. “It was a very difficult thing to make a decision on,” he said, “I didn’t want to see any whales die, but there was a possibility that, by being there, we were frustrating one species’ natural instinct and need.” In that instance, his crew moved the boat.He added that it was impossible to document an encounter between a human and another species objectively. “This notion of purity of an encounter between a human and another species is absolutely ridiculous. There’s no possibility of that.”Mike Gunton, the executive producer of the series, also defended the crew’s decision to help the penguins. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “In the 30 years I’ve been doing this, it’s one of the very few occasions when we’ve ever done anything like this because it’s a very unusual situation. Normally, you don’t interfere, you can’t interfere, or you wouldn’t interfere because of all sorts of consequences.“One, it would be very dangerous to do often for both you and the animal. Also, you’ll probably be changing the dynamics of the natural system or you might be depriving something of its food. But, in this particular situation, none of those things applied.”While it has previously been reported that Attenborough had opposed the move, saying that “tragedy is a part of life”, Gunton said that the presenter had told him he also would have rescued the penguins."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"30-year-old Drogheda local David Clerkin travelled to Denmark for the Ireland gameMobile network providers say they have provided no data to Government statistics agencySenator P\u0026aacutedraig \u0026Oacute C\u0026eacuteidigh had said Aer Arann Islands services would no longer runPersistent showers forecast from Tuesday at midday with accumulations of up to 35mmNew centre for early childhood studies aims to place Ireland at centre of global research mapDublin Regional Homeless Executive has set up a team to prepare for BrexitReview of process to award contract for rural network ordered in wake of Naughten resignationInitiative by Minister of State aims to increase EU participation in UN missionsBusiness studies students most likely to be accused of \u0026lsquoacademic dishonesty\u0026rsquoConference aims to develop better housing choices for elderlyPlanned amendment would ensure State control of water services authorityTaoiseach promises to increase top rate tax threshold to \u0026euro50,000 over five yearsReview recommends major changes to funding arrangements to voluntary service providersNSPCC says it made 197 referrals to agencies in North last year as Christmas appeal launchedRape defendants should not be allowed remain anonymous, says Sir John GillenConfidence-building measures for complainants \u0026lsquowho fear the cruel glare of public exposure\u0026rsquo are vitalPostmortem to be carried out and garda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses to incident near CarnewGarda\u0026iacute hold two in Clondalkin after three earlier arrests last Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

It is widely regarded as the first day of the Christmas shopping season, where many retailers reduce the price of products to boost sales.Which? tracked product prices at leading retailers including Currys PC World, Amazon, John Lewis and Argos, finding that almost half of products on offer were sold for less in the six months following Black Friday.The questionable deals investigated by Which? include a 60 inch TV, which Amazon advertised as £799 on Black Friday but was £50 cheaper on at least 62 occasions afterwards.Amazon was one of the retailers investigated by Which? A Sony Cybershot compact camera, advertised as £189 by Currys PC World, was also available for less money at least 27 times in the six months leading up to busy shopping day.The charity, who have said the findings bring “into question the true value of Black Friday”, are urging shoppers not to feel pressured into making a purchase this year and to do research into the price of products in the days before.They have also advised consumers to be cautious of online reviews, after their recent investigation found that shoppers are being misled by unscrupulous sellers using fake and paid-for online product reviews.Alex Neill, the managing director of home products and services at Which?, said: “The results of our investigation will disappoint many who are expecting nothing but bargains this Black Friday.“While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, it’s clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear. To bag a bargain, do your research and don’t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.”A John Lewis spokesman said that prices are lowered throughout the year as part of its Never Knowingly Undersold commitment.Currys PC World said they offer customers “pricing transparency” by stating in all channels exactly when a product was available for a higher price, while an Amazon spokesman said they offer “thousands of incredible deals” around Black Friday which save shoppers millions of pounds.How the Conservative-DUP pact works – and what would happen if Arlene Foster pulled the plugIvanka Trump \u0026#39used personal email account for government business\u0026#39 Man shot after stabbing police officer in the neck in BrusselsTrain derails near Barcelona, killing one and injuring sixComment: The Government wants us to trust it on Brexit, but it\u0026#39s given us no reason to do soComment: Businesses want a Brexit deal sealed – it\u0026#39s a leap to think they\u0026#39d back a second referendumOne in five cancer sufferers face discrimination in the workplaceTrade in \u0026#39legal highs\u0026#39 moves underground after banThe remarkable cricketer who hit the ball over Lord\u0026#39s pavilion \u0026#39denied blue plaque over mental health stigma\u0026#39Indonesian mosques preaching extremism to civil servants, warns intelligence agencyComment: Why are our railways so dire?

There were 1,523 seizures of NPS in 201718.This suggests that the Act has not completely eliminated the supply of NPS, given the large numbers of offences and seizures of suspected NPS recorded, the report said. While the open retailing of NPS has ceased, it appears that NPS continue to be sold, albeit less visibly.A 2018 study of darknet activity found large quantities of synthetic cannabinoids were available through darknet markets through 2016 and 2017, with around 2,400 listings. The study said the UK was the second largest seller of spice after China.Legal highs | Behind the glossy packagingWhile there had been about 270 prosecutions and 170 sentences under the Act, there was insufficient evidence to address the question of whether it had been enforced well, the review added.There was an explosion in the popularity of NPS on the drug scene around a decade ago.The drugs contain substances which mimic the effects of traditional illegal drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy.Ministers brought forward the legislation to crack down on NPS after they were linked to dozens of deaths.The 2016 legislation banned the production, distribution, sale and supply of psychoactive substances for human consumption. Offenders face up to seven years in prison, while civil orders can be issued to shut down head shops and online dealers.The Home Office review said data from police forces suggests the legislation has led to head shops either closing down or no longer selling NPS, with 332 retailers identified as having ceased sale of the substances, forcing it underground.Man shot after stabbing police officer in the neck in BrusselsTrain derails near Barcelona, killing one and injuring sixComment: The Government wants us to trust it on Brexit, but it\u0026#39s given us no reason to do soComment: Businesses want a Brexit deal sealed – it\u0026#39s a leap to think they\u0026#39d back a second referendumOne in five cancer sufferers face discrimination in the workplaceThe remarkable cricketer who hit the ball over Lord\u0026#39s pavilion \u0026#39denied blue plaque over mental health stigma\u0026#39Indonesian mosques preaching extremism to civil servants, warns intelligence agencyComment: Why are our railways so dire?

Found could be picked up for a better price outside of the Black Friday weekend was that the a 60” LG television advertised at £799 by Amazon during the promotion that was £50 cheaper on at least 62 occasions after Black Friday and dropped a further £150 for at least four days at the end of December and beginning of January.The Sony Cybershot HX60B Superzoom compact camera was advertised as £189 (save £10) on Black Friday by Currys PC World, but was found to be £10 cheaper in June and July last year and then again in December and January.The results suggest consumers should be careful about attributing too much value to discounts which may not be as good as they first appear.Despite the findings UK shoppers are expected to spend billions on the Black Friday period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The CBI’s John Allan will use his speech at the group’s annual conference to call on MPs to highlight the importance of compromising in order to “open a route to a long-term trade arrangement and (unlock) transition – the very least that companies need to prepare for Brexit”.Tory MP says \u0027we stand at the bar of history today\u0027- liveMay faces defeat over release of economic impact of her Brexit plansMay says Brexit deal will stop EU citizens \u0027jumping queue\u0027 into UKStop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitA compromise would not be perfect, Mr Allan is expected to say, but “most importantly, it avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure.”Mr Allan will also highlight a number of examples of businesses losing out on investment due to Brexit uncertainty. ““In the past few days alone, I’ve heard of a life sciences firm in the North West that has cut almost all investment in the UK – putting it instead in Germany and China,” he is expected to say.“I’ve heard a Northern Irish tech firm that has stopped winning contracts because their aerospace customers are worried about Brexit. And a construction firm says it now costs an extra £20,000 to build a house, due to a shortage of materials and labour since Brexit. “These stories are repeated across the country. 80 per cent of firms have already cut or postponed investment because of the risk of a no-deal exit.”The CBI conference begins at 10am on Monday 19th November, with the PM and various business figures scheduled to address attendees.

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The dollar’s soaring, the dollar’s plummeting.But why? What moves currency markets? Why do exchange rates fluctuate, often dramatically?The answer is supply and demand. If demand for a currency goes up its price will rise. If demand falls, its price will tend to fall.But what can determine supply and demand?First, expectations of national economic weakness. Think of things like war, or a natural catastrophe, or some other radical change of circumstances with economic implications. A good example is the impact of the Brexit referendum on sterling. So what’s going on? Bad macroeconomic news implies lower economic activity and less inward investment from abroad due to lower returns. That makes investing money in a currency less attractive to external investors, so there’s less demand for a currency from abroad. The result? The exchange rate goes down.Second, expectations of national economic strength. This works the other way. It can be sparked by unexpectedly good GDP figures. Perhaps a new oil or gas discovery. Sometimes it’s driven by political decisions. Think of US dollar currency’s response to Trump’s election victory, with him having promised tax cuts and an infrastructure spending splurge in the campaign. These were all expected to lift the growth rate, at least in the short term. Macroeconomic strength means interest rates likely to rise to head off domestic inflation. Rising domestic interest rates mean better returns which means more demand from abroad. The result? The exchange rate goes up.But it’s important to remember that the value of a currency is a relative measure. A nation’s currency is always valued in a foreign currency. So sterling is measured in dollars or euros or yen or rand or the Mongoloian togrog, you name it. If the value of another country’s currency rises that means yours can fall, even if nothing has really changed about the economic outlook for your country. When the dollar rises against the pound it can be because the US economy is doing well. It doesn’t necessarily mean the outlook for the UK economy has got any worseAnd a final word of caution. Don’t make the mistake of believing that currency moves are always based on rational and careful assessments by currency traders and investors of underlying economic conditions. In the short term – and possibly even the long term – there is a very large dose of knee-jerk sentiment, herding and, sometimes, blind panic involved.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It still isn’t clear who was most at fault for the IT disaster that continues to do down the bank’s good name, and we’ll probably never know for certain. It is clear that Debbie Crosbie may be entering the lion’s den when she joins next year.\u0026nbspTSB appoints Debbie Crosbie as new chief executive TSB owner Sabadell hit by IT failure costs with more expectedTSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure In case you’d forgotten, TSB was spun out of Lloyds, enjoying a brief time as an independent business before Sabadell moved in. Following the deal, it was decided that TSB should move off Lloyds’ IT system, for which it was paying a pretty penny, and onto one provided by its new owner.Trouble is, the transfer went disastrously wrong, resulting in people being locked out of online banking, and creating a political and media furore. TSB’s poor employees, who spent hours on end in its branches dealing with furious customers, went through hell too.\u0026nbspThe bank further compounded the issue by initially trying to downplay it and by failing to keep aggrieved customers properly informed about what was happening.\u0026nbspPester was slow to apologise and then went and told MPs on the Treasury Committee that all was well and they should think about switching to TSB when members of the MPs\u0027 own staff had told them they couldn’t access their accounts that morning.\u0026nbspPutting right what went wrong will be a tough ask for anyone, but on the face of it, Crosbie looks like a smart choice on the part of Sabadell, and the bank’s embattled chairman Richard Meddings, to do that.She’s currently the chief operating officer of CYBG, another ‘challenger’, which hasn’t been free of IT problems. So she knows the territory, and presumably has a good idea of what it takes to succeed with a mid sized bank in the British market.\u0026nbspBefore TSB can do that it needs to convince its customers, regulators and MPs that it can be trusted and is fit for purpose. That will be at the top of Crosbie’s to do list. She may also have to deal with some awkward politics, although that’s not unusual in banking.\u0026nbspTSB’s issues could have made the role tough to fill. But Crosbie was apparently one of 30 names to be given consideration, and topped a shortlist of four.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

To bag a bargain, do your research and don’t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.”Among the items Which? Found could be picked up for a better price outside of the Black Friday weekend was that the a 60” LG television advertised at £799 by Amazon during the promotion that was £50 cheaper on at least 62 occasions after Black Friday and dropped a further £150 for at least four days at the end of December and beginning of January.The Sony Cybershot HX60B Superzoom compact camera was advertised as £189 (save £10) on Black Friday by Currys PC World, but was found to be £10 cheaper in June and July last year and then again in December and January.The results suggest consumers should be careful about attributing too much value to discounts which may not be as good as they first appear.Despite the findings UK shoppers are expected to spend billions on the Black Friday period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The CBI’s John Allan will use his speech at the group’s annual conference to call on MPs to highlight the importance of compromising in order to “open a route to a long-term trade arrangement and (unlock) transition – the very least that companies need to prepare for Brexit”.Tory MP says \u0027we stand at the bar of history today\u0027- liveMay faces defeat over release of economic impact of her Brexit plansMay says Brexit deal will stop EU citizens \u0027jumping queue\u0027 into UKStop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitA compromise would not be perfect, Mr Allan is expected to say, but “most importantly, it avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure.”Mr Allan will also highlight a number of examples of businesses losing out on investment due to Brexit uncertainty. ““In the past few days alone, I’ve heard of a life sciences firm in the North West that has cut almost all investment in the UK – putting it instead in Germany and China,” he is expected to say.“I’ve heard a Northern Irish tech firm that has stopped winning contracts because their aerospace customers are worried about Brexit. And a construction firm says it now costs an extra £20,000 to build a house, due to a shortage of materials and labour since Brexit. “These stories are repeated across the country. 80 per cent of firms have already cut or postponed investment because of the risk of a no-deal exit.”The CBI conference begins at 10am on Monday 19th November, with the PM and various business figures scheduled to address attendees.

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

As well as dealing with the fallout from a major report into Facebook’s communications strategy, the announcement was made amid mounting\u0026nbspconcern that the internet\u0026nbspand social media giants like Facebook are not doing enough to help support local news organisations.Facebook did not say it would make\u0026nbspchanges to its news feed algorithm, which decides what news stories show up on users’ feeds. It also is not making any changes to the way it pays for the kind of journalists the scheme will help train.The new reporters\u0026nbspwill be trained as “community journalists” in the areas they will work, according to the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which will ensure that they gain qualifications through the process. And they will work at local newspapers owned by publishers\u0026nbspNewsquest, JPIMedia, Reach, Archant and the Midland News Association, all of which are taking part in the project.Facebook’s UK head of news partnerships Nick Wrenn said the announcement was in recognition of “the important role\u0026nbspFacebook\u0026nbspplays in how people get their news today, and we want to do more to support local publishers”. It would aim to “encourage more reporting from towns which have lost their local newspaper and beat reporters,”\u0026nbsphe said.The organisations behind the scheme also said they would focus on hiring a erse set of new journalists for the scheme.“The NCTJ cares deeply about the number, quality and ersity of journalists working in our local communities,” said\u0026nbspNCTJ chief executive Joanne Butcher.“We are very proud to support the sustainability of quality local journalism by overseeing the recruitment of additional local news journalists from erse and inclusive backgrounds and by ensuring they are properly trained and qualified.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sixteen nations were involved in its construction. In addition to the US and Russia, those were: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. \u0026nbsp2. No fewer than 136 space flights from seven different types of craft were deployed to deliver parts to the engineers. The large modules were delivered on 42 assembly flights: 37 on US shuttles, five on Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets.3. The result is the largest manned object in space, 357ft long — just a yard short of a full-length American football field.4. The ISS weighs 419,725kg including the weight of spacecrafts, of which it can accommodate as many as six at any one time.5. It is the single most expensive object ever built at £93.4bn.6. It is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus.7. The ISS travels at a speed of 4.791 miles per second, fast enough to go to the moon and back in a single day.Nasa space shuttle Endeavour (Getty)8. At that pace it orbits the earth approximately once every 90 minutes or 16 times in a 24-hour period, meaning it passes through 16 sunsets and sunrises per day. It passes over 90 per cent of the earth’s population in the course of its orbital path.9. The space station has more living space than a six-bedroom house, offering six sleeping quarters, a gym and a 360-degree bay window, but only two bathrooms. There are no chairs either —\u0026nbspastronauts taking time out to eat their three square meals a day of canned and dehydrated food have to float\u0026nbspgently in zero gravity. The atmosphere aboard is aboard is described as having a “metallic-ionisation-type smell”.Aki Hoshide participates in extravehicular activity outside the International Space Station (NasaGetty)10. So far 230 people from 18 nations have visited the ISS\u0026nbspand it has been continuously occupied since November 2000.11. Nasa’s Peggy Whitson set the record for the longest time living and working in space at 665 days on 2 September 2017, before returning to earth the next day.12. Astronauts aboard have completed 205 spacewalks since 1998 to carry out construction jobs, maintenance and repairs.ISS crew members\u0026nbspfrom the Vatican (Reuters)13. The physical toll all this takes on astronauts is considerable: crew members need to work out in the station\u0027s gym for at least two hours a day to mitigate the loss of bone and muscle mass and maintain the normal bodily health they would experience on terra firma.14. Four different delivery craft supply the crew with food\u0026nbspand equipment: Orbital ATK’s Cygnus, SpaceX’s Dragon, JAXA’s HTV and the Russian Progress.15. A Water Recovery System on board reduces the astronauts\u0027 dependence on these cargo craft by 65 per cent through recycling.

Oxygen is generated by a process of electrolysis: current captured from the station’s acre of solar panels is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.17. The ISS\u0027s internal pressurised volume is 32,333 cubic feet, which is roughly equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.18. Software on board the ISS monitors 350,000 sensors checking in on crew health and safety. The station meanwhile carries 50 computers and eight miles of wire, enough to run around the perimeter of Central Park in New York City.19. The ISS provided the set for the first music video ever shot outside of our atmosphere when commander Chris Hadfield\u0026nbspmade a short film set to\u0026nbspDavid Bowie’s “Space Oddity” up there in May 2013.20. To mark its turning 20, the ISS is getting a Refabricator for a birthday present. The device is a hybrid recycler and 3D printer that melts plastics down so that new tools can be created.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Given its brightness, it is surprising it was not discovered a lot sooner.Nasa reveals more about mysterious \u0027alien spacecraft\u0027 asteroidThe swirling cloud of dust is a mere 8,000 light years from Earth is a vast system made up of two shockingly bright stars. The astronomers who found it named it Apep, after the Egyptian god of chaos, reflecting the intensity and vastness of the system but also the curling shape of the snake-god, which matches its whirling appearance.The two bright stars\u0026nbsporbit each other every hundred years or so, according to the researchers. As they do, a fast wind is thrown off, moving as fast as\u0026nbsp12 million kilometres an hour.Eventually the system is going to throw out a\u0026nbsplong-duration gamma-ray burst, according to the astronomers who found it. They can last just a couple of seconds but throw out as much energy as the sun will emit in its whole lifetime.The two stars appear to be rotating so fast that they are close to ripping each other apart. It\u0027s that fast rotation that scientists expect will mean that Apep is likely to throw out one of the GRBs\u0026nbspwhen its core collapses at the end of its life.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

great pyramids of Giza excavated by insectsClick to followThe IndependentThe mounds are waste points for soil and other matter excavated from a vast underground tunnel networkA termite super-colony which s an area the size of Great Britain\u0026nbsphas been under construction since the time of the pyramids in ancient Egypt, scientists have found.Researchers studying the vast landscape of 200 million cone-shaped mounds in northeast Brazil sampled soil from 11 locations and found that some began construction around 3,820 years ago.At around 2.5 metres tall,\u0026nbsp9 metres wide at the base, and spread across 230,000 square kilometres, it\u0026nbsprepresents a vast earth-moving endeavour –\u0026nbspbut the\u0026nbspmounds are not inidual termite nests.Instead, each one is a “waste point”\u0026nbspwhere termite workers dump soil and other matter excavated in the production of a vast subterranean tunnel network which they have used to traverse the landscape in search of food for millennia.“This is apparently the world’s most extensive bioengineering effort by a single insect species,” said Roy Funch of Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana in Brazil, one of the authors of the report.“Perhaps most exciting of all – the mounds are extremely old – up to 4,000 years, similar to the ages of the pyramids.”Funch)The mounds are largely hidden from view by caatinga,\u0026nbspan assortment of thorny, desert-like vegetation unique to Brazil, and were only revealed to international scientists a few decades ago as the land was cleared for pasture.Now sampling from the oldest mounds has revealed the\u0026nbsparea is of comparable age to some of the oldest termite colony structures known to exist\u0026nbspin Africa, while others began construction around 600 years ago.They have developed in response to the drought-sculpted environment where the annual leaf fall is a boom time for harvesting food, punctuated by long periods where resources are more scarce.“These mounds were formed by a single termite species that excavated a massive network of tunnels to allow them to access dead leaves to eat safely and directly from the forest floor,” said Professor Stephen Martin, a social insect expert from\u0026nbspthe University of Salford and\u0026nbspanother of the authors.“The amount of soil excavated is over 10 cubic kilometres, equivalent to 4,000 great pyramids of Giza, and represents one of the biggest structures built by a single insect species.“It’s incredible that, in this day and age, you can find an ‘unknown’ biological wonder of this sheer size and age still existing, with the occupants still present.”The mounds are not the only entry points to the tunnel network – termites emerging at night to scavenge use dozens of smaller entrances between each waste point.Dying 700-year-old tree put on drip to save it from termitesTermites devour 10m rupees at bankAnts rescue injured workers during wars with termites, study findsBy inspecting mounts cut in half by\u0026nbsproad building projects, Professor Martin and colleagues also showed they lack the complex honeycomb of tunnels\u0026nbspusually associated with a termite nest.Instead each includes a single large central tunnel – measuring 10 cm across – connecting to the underground tunnel network and a series of horizontal “galleries” containing dead leaves or larvae.“The\u0026nbsptunnels\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspnever\u0026nbspleft\u0026nbspopen\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspenvironment,\u0026nbspruling\u0026nbspout\u0026nbsptheir\u0026nbspuse\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspventilation\u0026nbspsystem,” which left them puzzled as to how and why they had been created at such regular intervals.One theory is that each mound was from a competing colony, but when they transferred termites to a\u0026nbsprival neighbouring mound they were not swarmed and attacked.This\u0026nbspsuggests\u0026nbspthat they intermingle underground rather than competing, and\u0026nbspwhen they did the same test with termites taken from mounds 50km away the attack response was immediate.It suggests there must be shared pheromone scent cues used across\u0026nbsp the tunnel network which identify\u0026nbsplocal neighbours.Professor Martin and his colleagues suggest that these scent markers may exist at each mound point to\u0026nbspensure every termite uses it to remove soil and waste, leading to the equal spacing.Great Pyramid of GizaWonder of the Ancient WorldShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community

I got to dance twice, went up in a hot air balloon twice, and I loved it twice.”Silverton\u0027s dance partner Aljaž Škorjanecand said: “Every week going out there and delivering incredible performances, for someone that has never performed in her life I am so incredibly proud of you.

My mum was over visiting and pointed it out to me and was utterly shocked - so I checked it immediately.I thought she surely must’ve been mistaken but to my horror she was right. I think someone celebrating the life of a man who’s caused such terror is outrageous. And if it’s a joke, it’s not remotely funny.”Fellow resident Victoria Adcock, 42, said: “It’s obviously a prank. People being outraged are just playing into the prankster’s hands. They should just take it off and forget about it.”Claire Newbigging, 37, said: “I’ve not seen it first hand but it’s got to be a joke. I just don’t get it - would anyone really want to commemorate someone like Saddam Hussein?”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Spanish Government has warned that it would reject May\u0027s Brexit deal unless changes are made with regards to Gibraltar.

We on this side of the House will always engage with professionals, with experts, with NGOs, we are not so proud we don’t think we can learn as we try to adjust universal credit for the benefit of everybody.“But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying, but we look forward to working with experts in the area to make sure we get the right outcome for the people we want to look after.”Amber Rudd becomes sixth DWP secretary in less than three yearsEarlier in the debate, Justin Tomlinson, minister for family support, housing and child maintenance, said the government “disagreed” with Mr Alston’s findings, and defended universal credit as a “simplified benefit system that helps some of the most vulnerable people in society”.The remarks from the new work and pensions secretary\u0026nbspand Mr Tomlinson will exacerbate concerns raised in the UN report that ministers are “in a state of denial”\u0026nbspover the state of poverty in\u0026nbspBritain.\u0026nbspDelivering his findings on Friday, Mr Alston\u0026nbspsaid: “What I found in my discussions with ministers, is basically a state of denial. The ministers with whom I met have told me that things are going well, that they don’t see any big problems, and they are happy with the way in which their policies are playing out.“But it’s of course not the story that I heard in my travels through Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and in quite a few cities in England.”Theresa May appointed Ms Rudd as the new work and pensions secretary last week after Esther McVey stood down from the role on Thursday in protest at the prime minister’s Brexit deal.The decision prompted immediate criticism from opposition parties, who suggested Ms Rudd’s conduct when the Windrush scandal emerged – a fiasco that forced her to resign – should disqualify her from a top government job.Critics also warned that she\u0026nbspwas taking on a “poisoned chalice” as she becomes the sixth work and pensions secretary in less than three years.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They\u0026nbspwill consider it a major victory that the prime minister’s proposed deal will be officially compared with the potential merits of staying in the EU and\u0026nbspnot merely considered against the risks of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Umunna said the amendment could “change everything”.Writing exclusively for The Independent, he said: “In a big admission – given she has been peddling, for many weeks, the falsehood that the choice is between her deal and no deal – the PM conceded in the House of Commons last week that the country actually faces three choices: no Brexit no deal or her agreement.“Therefore it is only right that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare provided with an economic analysis with a comparison between those options. Anything less would amount to pulling the wool over the eyes of parliamentarians and the people we represent.\u0026nbsp“Let parliament see the figures, and then\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan weigh up just how bad the trajectory the country is on will be for our communities.”Theresa May: ‘It’s the future relationship that delivers on the Brexit vote. It’s the future relationship that actually says this is the right deal for the future for our country’Speaking after ministers agreed to back down, he added: “This was the first test of strength facing the People’s Vote campaign in parliament since the government published their draft deal, and it is one that we in the campaign have won after gaining support from all sides of the House.“The government was planning to con the British people. It is vital at this crucial time for our country that MPs and the public know the full facts about the cost of Brexit and how it compares to the deal we already have inside the EU.”The latest blow to the prime minister’s authority came as Tory Brexiteers scrambled to secure enough signatures to trigger a vote of no confidence in her.Despite claiming\u0026nbspthey would have reached the threshold of 48\u0026nbspby Monday night, the rebels appeared to still be short of support as their attempt to oust Ms May rapidly lost momentum.But Ms May faced a further headache as the DUP, whose votes she relies on in Parliament, broke their agreement to back the government on key issues and abstained during\u0026nbspseveral Finance Bill votes.\u0026nbspDUP abstain from crucial vote in warning over May’s Brexit agreementPro-Brexit Tories struggling to gather support for May challengeSpain threatens to reject Brexit deal over GibraltarNo-deal Brexit spending by UK firms a waste of money says CBIEight of the party’s ten\u0026nbspMPs also backed a Labour amendment on child poverty.It raises urgent questions over the future of the pact between the DUP and the Tories just weeks before Parliament is expected to hold the crunch vote on the prime minister’s Brexit plan.Ms May will need the DUP’s support if her deal is to have any chance of passing the Commons.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Concerns centre on four areas, the authors\u0026nbspsaid: ensuring criminals are kept out, relieving pressure on public services, ensuring access to good jobs, and promoting integration.Lord Adonis said: “The choice between EU membership and controlling migration is a false one. Electronic ID cards would mean we know exactly who is here and give us real control over access to out public services and entitlements.“A new Strengthening Communities Fund could pump £2bn\u0026nbspa year into the public services and infrastructure facing new demand, and we could have tougher minimum wage enforcement and new rules to ensure British workers have the first chance to apply for new jobs when they need it.“These policies are practical, actionable solutions to immigration that are already being deployed across Europe. I believe strongly that they will help to persuade voters that the best way to take back control is to stay in the EU and get serious about immigration and welfare enforcement - so let’s do that instead of trashing our economy on the basis of a false choice.”Created with Sketch.

This data could be used to inject fresh funding into public services in areas where immigration has surged.At the same time, Global Future said, the government should strengthen workers’ rights and set up “enforcement squads” to crack down on unscrupulous employers, including those that do not pay\u0026nbspthe minimum wage.And a new multi-billion pound Strengthening Communities Fund should be set up to help teach migrants English and encourage them to integrate within their communities, the think thank said. This would replace the existing Controlling Migration Fund.The investment should partly be used to reverse swingeing cuts to English language classes since 2010, it added.Peter Starkings, director of Global Future, said:\u0026nbsp“Free movement has been good for Britain – it’s boosted our economy, created jobs and helped millions of Brits live, work and study across Europe. Throwing it all away is a terrible mistake that will damage Britain and deepen the very burning injustices the prime minister has promised to address.“This report sets out a better way: control free movement so that it works for Britain.

We know that genuine ‘parity of esteem’ will need resources as well as rhetoric,” Ms Rayner said.“But achieving a deep seated culture change, where employers both know and value different kinds of education, needs leadership from government as well. So a Labour Government will practise what it preaches.“We will end the snobbery that underpins attitudes towards different types of qualification and end the assumption that academic qualifications should be a basic entry requirement for jobs in Whitehall, limiting them to where they are necessary.“Government itself will lead the way in setting a clear example to other employers that a person’s skills and experience is as valuable as any particular type of qualification.“And we will ensure that those working at the heart of government become more representative of the country they serve.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Spanish Government has warned that it would reject May\u0027s Brexit deal unless changes are made with regards to Gibraltar.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The prime minister has described this period as ‘critical’ and I would expect the talks this week to be intensive.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It would be a huge upset if they did not sign the agreement.The Daily Mail and the  could save us from a hard BrexitThere will not be any negotiation on the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – that, as far as the EU is concerned, is settled. Many countries have said as much publicly, in the face of cabinet Brexiteers demanding a rethink.But the second part of the deal, the future relationship, is far from sealed. If anything, EU states believe their negotiators might have given away too much to Britain: some are unhappy about concessions given with little in return, and want quid pro quos like guaranteed access to British waters for their fishing fleets.If there are changes there, things could get even trickier for the prime minister at home – but these are real countries fighting for their own interests, not fantasy negotiating partners only committed to making things easy for the prime minister.None of the details for the summit are finalised yet, with an agenda set to be released later this week. We’re not sure at this point whether actual negotiation will take place at it, or whether it will just be a glorified rubber stamp. Brussels is known to favour the latter.I was on holiday during the Brexit chaos – what did I miss?Legally, the summit has to take place, because only the European Council – that is the 27 leaders meeting together in Brussels – can sign off the deal and make the political declaration about the future relationship.Those in Brussels and other EU capitals do not like being seen to “meddle” in British politics, precisely because they know how poorly they are perceived.They mostly stayed out of the referendum, they accepted the result, and they have mostly declined to call for a rerun or anything to that effect.But it is possible some may break the habit of a lifetime at the gathering and urge British members of parliament to back the deal. If they do not do it directly, they might apply pressure through other means – perhaps by warning of the prospect of no deal if it is voted down.This will be a difficult sell, however. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said as recently as last week that Brexit could be stopped if Britain wanted. If the deal is voted down, staying in is still an option. And there is clearly not a majority for a no-deal departure in the House of Commons.But despite conspiracy theories from both some Brexiteers and the odd\u0026nbspRemainer, everyone around the summit table will want a deal – just not necessarily at any cost.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A Home Office minister called it an “atrocious murder”.Russian prosecutors now say, without providing evidence, that\u0026nbspMr Browder probably poisoned Magnitsky himself.“I cannot believe that a Russian official will lead Interpol,” tweeted Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia who Mr Putin considers an enemy.“Russia has an unimpressive record of practising the rule of law at home and a proven track record of abusing red notices and diffusions for political purposes.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Donald Trump has criticised a retired Navy Seal over his handling of the search for Osama Bin Laden.

Its settlements there are considered illegal by most world powers.Palestinians deem the settlements, and the military presence needed to protect them, to be obstacles to their goal of establishing a state. Israel disputes this.Israel’s plan to demolish West Bank village ‘could be war crime’“We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians,” Airbnb said on its website.“Our hope is that someday sooner rather than later, a framework is put in place where the entire global community is aligned so there will be a resolution to this historic conflict and a clear path forward for everybody to follow.”Palestinians and their supporters had long lobbied Airbnb to delist the settlements. Israel strongly opposes such calls for boycotts, which it considers a biased approach to the conflict.Israeli tourism minister Yariv Levin called Airbnb’s move “the most wretched of wretched capitulations to the boycott efforts”.Speaking on Israel’s Channel 13 television, he said Israel was not told of the decision in advance and that it would respond by backing lawsuits by settlement listers against Airbnb in US courts.Waleed Assraf, head of a Palestinian anti-settlement group run by the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation, welcomed Airbnb’s decision. Should other companies follow suit, he told Reuters, “this will contribute to achieving peace”.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Donald Trump has criticised a retired Navy Seal over his handling of the search for Osama Bin Laden.

Here is what we know about the search.Madeleine vanished on May , , when her family, from Leicestershire, were holidaying in the Algarve, Portugal.Parents Gerry and Kate left their three children – including toddler twins Sean and Amelie – sleeping in their apartment while they dined at a tapas bar -  metres away.When Kate ed to check on the kids at around pm that evening, she discovered that Maddie was not in her bed and was missing.In September of that year, Gerry and Kate, both doctors, were sensationally named as ‘arguidos’ by Portuguese police.The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.Maddie would have turned  on on May , .In April , UK cops released a computer generated image of Maddie showing what she would look like aged nine.A number of potential leads have emerged since the little girl vanished, but none amounted to anything and no arrests have ever been made.In May , witness Jane Tanner said Gerry had played tennis with a man wrongly identied as her abductor on the day she went missing.She said she spent up to half an hour watching Gerry McCann and Dr Julian Totman, , play on May , .Less than three hours later, she saw a man carrying a child in pyjamas near the McCanns’ apartment in Praia da Luz.But she did not recognise Dr Totman and cops pursued the lead for four years, despite the GP saying it was probably him.There have been more than , potential sightings of the Brit three-year-old since her disappearance, but police have so far failed to locate her.politan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there are signicant investigative avenues that are of great interest to both the UK and Portuguese teams investigating.Met cops believe she was stolen by child traffickers or sex fiends, or during a burglary gone wrong.Meanwhile, cops are now hunting a person of signicance in a shock new development.A source close to Scotland Yards search Operation Grange said the person is now a critical line of inquiry in the £million investigation, according to The Times.And a former Met police chief has called for fresh interview of Maddies parents and the Tapas Seven - who have never been quizzed by British cops.Cops moved the search to Bulgaria as they try to find a woman in purple they want to speak to.Funding for the search was due to expire in October .But on September , , it was confirmed investigators have received £, to keep the probe alive until March .Then more funding - said to be around £, was granted in March .The extra cash for Operation Grange is being used to investigate signicant leads, which Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley described as very worthwhile.Kate and and Gerry are “extremely thankful to both the Home Office and Scotland Yard for the continued funding,” their spokesman Clarence Mitchell said.The Home Office announced it was ploughing more money into Operation Grange, the official investigation, at the latest request of Met Police.In February  it was confirmed that the politan Police were asking the Home Office for more funding to continue the work of Operation Grange.Scotland Yards investigation has been ongoing since .During that time the number of detectives working on the case has been cut from  to four in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His favourite food was biscuits soaked in spirits.On Jumbos journey from London to the US, he needed a daily allotment of whisky to keep him calm.He also used to eat anything thrown at him by visitors, including childrens toys and coins - hundreds of which were found in his stomach after he died.Last year, Sir David Attenborough investigated the le of the elephant claimed to be the largest to have ever lived in a BBC documentary.Sir David said: “I’m going to look beyond Jumbo’s celebrity for the real elephant behind the myths.“How big was he in reality  And what is the truth behind the mysteries that surround his tragic death ”Sir David and his team were given unique access to Jumbo’s remains at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, shedding light on the unforgettable true story behind an amazing elephant.When the team analysed Jumbo’s bones, it discovered evidence of how his le in captivity damaged him physically.After finding an unusual layering of old and new bone in his hip, Dr Richard Thomas, from the University of Leicester, said: “He has many signs of stress and strain-related injuries.“They must have been incredibly painful for him but may have reflected the use to which he was put.”Often pictured giving rides to visitors at the zoo, it seems Jumbo may have been harmed by the ones who loved him most.And Jumbo had more than just a damaged hip.Dr Thomas added: “When we look at the knee we see all sorts of kind of changes in the bone that we wouldn’t really expect to see in an elephant his age. Remember Jumbo’s only  and still growing.”So Jumbo could have suffered from painful joint problems more associated with old age.Sir David concluded: “His bones are more like an elephant in its s or s.”PT Barnum claimed Jumbo was the largest African elephant on the planet, standing at around ft.But by analysing his leg bone, the team discovered he was around ft in at the time of his death.A typical wild African elephant of the same age measures around ft in.However, a crack in Jumbo’s leg bone reveals that he was still growing when he died.Dr Thomas said: “Male African elephants continue to grow until they are  so Jumbo had another  years of getting bigger.”He may not have been as tall as Barnum claimed, but according to Sir David: “He could have matched that claim had he lived.”Jumbo’s calm nature during the day was in contrast to his behaviour at night.Sir David said: “He would become possessed by terryingly violent rages in which he would smash the timbers of his enclosure.”Jumbo was also prone to hurting himself in his confusion, even breaking off both tusks on one occasion. When they grew back, he ground them down against the stonework of his enclosure.His keeper, Matthew Scott, is said to have given him whisky to try to calm him down.The zoo’s superintendent, Abraham Bartlett, was convinced Jumbo was suffering from musth, a natural condition affecting young male elephants when they become sexually mature. It can cause them to become extremely aggressive.But Dr Vicki Fishlock, a researcher in Kenya, disagrees.She argues that musth would have caused Jumbo to be violent towards his keepers, too.And as Sir David pointed out: “There is nothing in the historical records that Jumbo was ever violent towards people.”A new clue emerged when the team found evidence of malformed teeth when studying Jumbo’s skull.Dr Thomas said: “We can think of elephant teeth a bit like conveyor belts. They have six teeth but only one will be in wear on each side at any one time.“Another one will be coming in underneath to replace it at the time which that tooth falls out.”If a tooth does not wear down enough, it will not fall out and will block the new tooth, bending it out of shape. This would lead to terrible toothache.”And Professor John Hutchinson, from the Royal Veterinary College, believes his toothache could have been made worse by the sticky buns pushed through his bars by visitors to the zoo.”Sir David said: “Anyone who’s had toothache knows that it seems worse at night when you have no distractions, so maybe this is one of the explanations for Jumbo’s terrying nocturnal rages.”Dr Holly Miller, from the University of Nottingham, took samples from Jumbo’s femur and rib bones to discover more about the food he was eating.She said: “We’re definitely seeing some suggestion that he’s not getting the iety of diet that other elephants should.”In the wild, African elephants have a ied diet of grass, leaves, twigs and even bark. Dr Miller says the pathologies of Jumbo’s teeth show they were soft and coming through at the wrong angle because they were not being used in the right way.“They’re not being used to grind down the right food.According to a report at the time, his stomach was filled with English pennies, whistles, keys and rivets.It has been reported that Jumbo used to habitually eat coins which had been thrown into his enclosure - and the evidence supports this.Jumbo’s stuffed body was then kept at Tufts University in Massachusetts but was lost in a fire.Jumbo’s tail still remains, from which Dr Miller analysed hair to give a snapshot of his diet almost right before he died.It revealed a high amount of nitrogen, which suggests his body was under stress and was extracting as much nitrogen as possible from his diet to help repair it.In September , Barnum’s circus went to Canada to perform in St Thomas, Ontario. Written records show that Jumbo was suffering from a sort of wasting disease at this time.After the show, Jumbo and a small elephant called Tom Thumb were being loaded on to the circus train when a freight train came hurtling towards them.Accounts of what happened next dfer, with Barnum claiming Jumbo sacriced his own le by running towards the train to save his friend Tom Thumb.But Sir David found more clues on a visit to the Elgin County Museum in the town where Jumbo died.Curator Mike Baker showed him a photo taken shortly after the collision, saying: “You can see abrasions on his hide which match very nicely with the one good graphic from soon after the collision.”It shows the train coming up behind Jumbo, which would have caused the scrapes on his body.Examining the drawing, Sir David said: “That is the circus train with the box car that Jumbo was going to get into, and the locomotive would outrun him and hit him in the rear and that’s the end of poor Jumbo — not what Barnum said.”And with no evidence of fractures on the skeleton, he concludes the most likely cause of death was internal bleeding - leading to a tragic end to a sad and short le.Even after his death, Jumbo was not allowed to rest.He was displayed in a gala in New York and paraded for four years as a roadside attraction.Dumbo will be released in theatres in March .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the s, Ted Heath and Harold Wilson both knew we would baulk at belonging to a Common Market that robbed us of our national independence.So they hid its true purpose — “ever closer union”, leading to a superstate with one currency. The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot.

Is there another room you can go into Jessica replied: No, can you hurry up please  Im begging you.Ms Russell told her: They are, theyre right below you. But you need to keep yourself safe.Giving evidence, the officer admitted she had no information that firefighters were on their way, but said she was trying to reassure the youngster.Counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC asked her: Did it occur to you that you had not yet assessed the security of the escape route and telling her that the crews were coming up, without having solid information to back that up, meant that you might be lulling her into a  sense of security Ms Russell said: At the time, no. It was based on what I would expect to happen, what should happen.It was more about comforting her and trying to get her through that situation and get the information .In a written statement Ms Russell said she was glad she had stayed on the call evenit was only to offer her a little support.After about an hour I could not get anymore response from her - only rasping sounds, then nothing, she said.Reflecting on that call, I felt completely helpless.When people are pleading with you, saying [they] do not want to die and I cannot physically do anything to help them - it is very hard.The information that Jessica had fled to a higher floor was not passed on to fire crews on the ground, who searched her flat but found no trace of the youngster.Ms Russell said that, not long after the call ended, she became aware the advice to callers had been changed from stay-put to attempt to evacuate.OPERATOR: Hello JESSICA: Mum.OPERATOR: Hello, its the Fire Brigade.JESSICA: Mum!OPERATOR: Hello, can you hear me JESSICA: Theres a kitchen, theres a kitchen on fire.OPERATOR: Theres, theres a fire in your kitchen, did you say JESSICA: Hello, theres a fire in the building.OPERATOR: In the building  Whats the name of the building JESSICA: Urn, Grenfell Tower.OPERATOR: Grenfell Tower, okay.

Your pecs, abs and arms — and thanks to Instagram, your wealth, car and clothes. Thanks to porn, it’s how long you can last at sex, how many positions you do it in, how big your penis is. Then there’s the terror she will tell all to her mates on social mediayou weren’t very good. It’s all so exhausting, I tend to stay single.”Student, , Belfast: “In relationships, I’d like to have more understanding, connection and vulnerability. Other people’s lives look better. I’m only  but I already dread dying without having felt loved.”MARKETING manager, , Liverpool: “I cant trust women any more because they keep cheating on me. This is all because of Tinder and Instagram. It’s like wild animals are always swarming around your girl. You can keep them away in person but tech means they can get to her  . So all I do now is use porn. I feel locked in by tech, from all angles.”Lab assistant, , Coventry: “I’d like to lose my gut, have a nicer and more symmetrical face, get some new teeth, have nicer hair and bigger arms. Actually, there’s not much about me that I do like.”Unemployed, , Lancs: “If my partner were more sexual, that’d be good. But I’m very happy to be having any sex at all.”Teacher, , Corby, Northants: “I’d like more sex, more respect, more attention, less arguing. The we’s told me I can have that when I lose some weight and cut down on the drinking. So it’s a stalemate.”Office worker, , Cumbria: “I would like bigger arms and to tidy up my stomach a bit, plus white teeth and a strong jawline. But those things won’t happen because I’m too busy for the gym and love chocolate. Thus, I have made my peace with the fact I shall never be some Greek Adonis.”Researcher, , East Midlands: “Why is it that women expect men to Hoover, wash, cook, clean and change nappies, but when you ask them to make dinner, it turns into some sort of gender battle about sexism  Women these days would rather watch Bake Off and buy a ready meal. They’ve forgotten how to cook like their mums, while we still slave like our dads.”Marketing analyst, , Manchester: “Sometimes I look at my ripped body and think, ‘Who is this for  Do I even want to look like this ’ I’m straight but I’m always at the gym to try to beef up, which means I have no social le and spend most of my time either looking at myself in the mirror or comparing myself ­unfavourably with other, bigger men. I remove all my body hair as that seems to be what women want these days. Is it  When did men become so obsessed with how other men look  My mates joke that I’m too in love with myself to find time for girls, and I’m starting to believe them.”I.T. expert, , Edinburgh: “Often I feel that when I’m asked my opinion, it’s not because she wants to know my opinion, but just to check I hold the ‘correct’ opinion.”Retail worker, , Cardf: “Stupid things I did in the past worry me, especially under the ­influence of drink and or drugs. #MeToo scares me. The thought that a man’s reputation can be destroyed by one unfounded allegation keeps me awake at night.”CIVIL servant, , Scotland: “At the age of seven I was abused, yet was not able to tell my we about it due to the shame. Talking to a robot is easier.”Company director, , London: “I would like sex. Any sex. Fewer financial demands. Fewer general complaints about every small ­grievance in daily le. Less assuming that it’s my responsibility to fix every issue. All my relationships so far have felt a bit pointless.”Construction worker, , Newcastle: “All we seem to do is argue about Brexit. We used to love each other, but since the referendum she keeps calling me thick, racist and once even a fascist. That’s hard to take.”Admin worker, , Birmingham: “I worry about being alone, losing all of my loved ones, Trump, Brexit, the economy and going bald.”Army officer, , Bristol: “What worries me is feeling like a failure because I have to leave my family for long periods. I’ve missed so much of my kids growing up, but needs must.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show. Paddy Considine, Jessica Raines and Bel Powley all performing brilliantly in BBC’s Informer.Channel ’s strangely addictive and reassuring live operations series, with Nicky Campbell.Prime-Minister-in-waiting Johnny Mercer MP breezing through Celebrity Hunted, without dear old Kay Burley to encumber him.Scotland playing olé football against the mighty Albania.And the politically incorrect brilliance of the response Chase contestant Bethan gave to Bradley Walsh’s question: “The name of what German ­company comes from the name of founder Adolf Dassler ”“Hitler.”Compiled by Graham WrayGary Neville: “Lingard has his hands in his head.”Michael Dawson: “It’s an unexpected start for Spurs because they didn’t expect that.”Trevor Bayliss: “We’ve come to Sri Lanka to play in conditions which are foreign to us.”And Paul Merson: “A poor finish from Vardy, but that’s him at his best.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is particularly unfortunate that, despite calls for it to do so, the Treasury has refused to publish details of the model that it has used to make its bloodcurdling forecasts, nor to make clear the assumptions that it has fed into the model.Why do you think this might be  Over and above this secrecy, there are several reasons why we should discount alarmist forecasts. First of all, we have been here before.In , at the behest of the then ­Chancellor, George Osborne, the Treasury forecast that in the event of a vote to leave the EU, the economy would ­experience either a “shock” or a “severe shock”, amounting to a recession.In the former case, GDP would fall slightly and in the latter case sharply. This would be accompanied by falls in house prices of up to  per cent and a rise in unemployment of more than ,.In reality, the economy has kept growing pretty strongly. Meanwhile, house prices have carried on rising and, far from unemployment increasing, it has fallen by ,.This example of gross forecasting error with regard to a major national decision is not an isolated example.In , just about the whole of the UK establishment favoured staying on the Gold Standard, which was exerting severe deflationary pressure on the UK economy.The great and the good told us thatwe left, all hell would break loose. Well, we did leave and all heaven broke loose, with the fastest sustained growth of output in our industrial history.Fast forward to . The UK was again trapped in an exchange rate regime, this time the European Exchange Rate Mechanism , which was again exerting extreme deflationary pressure on the ­economy.The Treasury, aided and abetted by all the usual ­suspects, said thatwe left the ERM we would face a catastrophe. Supposedly, inflation would rocket, ­interest rates would soar and the economy would tank.On September , we were forced out of the ERM — despite the Government’s best efforts to stay in. The result was lower inflation, lower interest rates and a burst of growth that brought unemployment and the budget deficit sharply lower.Not many years later, the establishment was at it again, trying to get the UK to join the euro.This time, the Treasury was on the side of the angels.But the overwhelming majority of the establishment, including the BBC, business bigwigs and establishment newspapers, was in favour of joining the euro.Indeed, it foresaw dire consequenceswe failed to join.In view of these forebodings, the outcome is particularly interesting.Since the euro was formed in , the German and French economies have grown by  per cent, the Italian economy by nine per cent — and the poor old UK, self- excluded from the enormous benefits of the euro, has grown by  per cent. Funny, that.A large part of the Treasury’s current gloomy view of our no-deal future rests upon the assumption that after Brexit the frictional costs of trading with the EU will be large.Yet not only do umpteen countries around the world export large amounts of goods into the EU, but also the rate of increase of these exports has been higher than the rate of increase of exports from most member countries to other members.If border frictions were such an ­appalling barrier, what explains these non-EU countries’ evident export ­success Supposedly, leaving the EU is going to disrupt our supply chains. You would think that the EU was the only economic area in the world that benefited from ­integrated supply chains.Yet they are in place in East Asia, in North and South America and globally, crossing currency, legal and customs ­barriers.

Running hard to avoid falling over is a bad choice for a Prime Minister who’ll know privately her unpopular, chaotic plan is a far worse deal for Britain than remaining in Europe. Surrendering sovereignty to minimise economic damage is May’s cowardly compromise. A braver PM would denounce forcefully the cost-free easy Britannia bonanza fabricated by fibbers Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, then champion another referendum. The uncomfortable home truths about stockpiling medicines and food as well as troops on the streets put into perspective the Leavers’ mythical poundmillion a week saving promise on the side of a bus. Timid Theresa May doesn’t come clean because she’s afraid of insulting five Cabinet Brextremists organising against her including Michael Gove and a Liam Fox suddenly believing any deal’s better than no deal.  She might survive a no-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in the coming weeks. But May is not strong and stable. She is living to die another day and her botched plan is barely worth the name. So a sovereign Parliament gains a glorious opportunity to take back control next month. Jeremy Corbyn’s immediate task is to convince his Westminster waverers the choice isn’t May’s mess or accidentally crashing out of Europe without a leline. Tory Leaver Zac Goldsmith declaring he’d have voted Remain in place of May’s mayhem. Brexit paymaster Arron Banks said last Sunday he’d do the same. They are rats abandoning the Quitter ship. The , who marched in London for another referendum were mocked as the longest Waitrose queue in history yet Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn attracting just four people to his protest outside No  was another sign which camp has the momentum. Time is running out but anything is possible before March  – an extension before departure, a referendum, a general election. The only certainty is the future’s unpredictability.

But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Prime Ministers language was offensive and disgraceful. The SNP leader said: That the case for Brexit has been reduced to such a miserable and self defeating bottom line is depressing in the extreme. Lets lt our sights higher than this.Actually, the more I think about it, the more offensive jump the queue  is as a description of a reciprocal right of free movement. Really disgraceful. Businesses in sectors which rely on low-skilled workers, such as hospitality, manufacturing and the care industry, have raised concerns about the impact of restrictions on labour. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said firms needed time to adapt to the seismic sht in the immigration system. And NHS recruiters fear the new system could cut off the supply of overseas nurses and carers. Federation of Small Businessesnational chairman Mike Cherry said: One in five small employers rely on staff from the EU. More than one in three say finding the right staff is currently holding back growth.If theyre lumbered with complex paperwork and a surcharge to bring in EU staff post- Brexit , that will cause a signicant drag on the billions they contribute to the economy each year.Danny Mortimer, NHS Employers chief executive, warned the planned changes could cut off the supply of nurses.  We know we need to increase the number of UK trained health professionals, especially nurses, he said. The recommendations on salary thresholds and having no need for a so called lower skilled, lower wage, route into the UK would cut off the supply of nurses from overseas and there would be no mechanism for employing people into care worker roles. It would be completely unacceptable to allow vital social care services to close under the strain of not having the people required to provide the necessary care. Downing Street defended the plans. Theresa Mays Cabinet has signed off a -page draft Brexit deal with Brussels - and it has enraged Tories. Here are some of the reasons why:The transition period can be extended - and we dont know how long for Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop European courts will still have a big hold on the UKFOR THE FULL GUIDE CLICK HEREAsked whether Mrs May regarded EU nationals currently working in the NHS and other public services as having jumped the queue , the PMs official spokesman said: We have always been clear of the important contribution which EU citizens make to our economy and to public services.The point the Prime Minister is making is that we wish to have a global system where peoples skills are the basis on which they are able to work in the UK. At the moment, we have two systems in place - one for people coming to the UK from outside the EU and one for people coming out under the rules of free movement. Its a fact that people coming under the system of free movement dont need a visa and those from outside the EU do. The spokesman said an immigration white paper setting out the proposed new system was due to be published shortly.

Apologising in a Faceook post, Swansea Council leader Rob Stewart agreed that Sundays parade was not good enough. He said: It was always going to be challenging. I have been clear since the disappointment of two years ago that we would deliver a traditional Christmas event with Disney style elements.  Last year the parade was well received and I expected that we would deliver the same experience this year. It hasnt happened. He said it was down to roadworks and building work, meaning this years route had to be altered and there were fewer floats and performers.

Eugenie changed into the dress for the evening after marrying Jack Brooksbank in a ceremony at Windsor Castle. After saying their vows in St Georges Chapel on October , the pair headed to an evening party at the York family home Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park. Eugenies pink gown was the inspiration of American fashion designer Zac Posen. The world caught glimpse of the gown from the front as they headed to the reception - but now the dramatic design of the back has been revealed. Eugenie set off her evening look with diamond and emerald drop earrings which were a wedding gt from the groom, and a hair slide belonging to the Queen.  Both her main wedding dress and her evening gown were designed to show off her scar which she got when she received surgery for scoliosis. Speaking about showing her scars on her wedding day, Eugenie said: Its a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this. I think you can change the way beauty is and you can show people your scars and I think its really special to stand up for that, reports the Evening Standard.  An official statement read: “The choice of colour reflects the blush of an English rose. “Mr Posen took his inspiration from the White Rose of York. The pin-tucked plisseacute is cut on the bias and mixed with signature drapes. The White Rose of York is subtlety embroidered on both the shoulder and back which hold together the cape.” The silk for the gown came from the British mill Biddle Sawyer Silk, the palace added.

The -year-old was unaware of the alleged creepy campaign by Basra, who is a fellow law student at the University of Dundee. Chloe claims that whenever she posted something on Instagram, Basra would copy them within hours, using the same poses, clothes and wording, reports the Daily Record. In a horrying twist, the mimicry even includes photos Chloe posted when her dad died. When Chloe and her big sister, Linzi, looked further into what was happening, they discovered hundreds of the bizarre photos.

He began sending abusive messages, and after they split up warned her not to go to a party.He found her in a hot tub with someone  when he arrived, and said: Who the f*** is that  Simmons produced a flick-kne with a three-inch blade, which prosecutors accepted was already at the property, and threatened everyone there with it, saying: Im going to kill you all.  In later messages, Simmons said he would stab her mum and her family, and on December  sent a WhatsApp message threatening to acid-burn her face off and slice them implants out of her chest. Glenn Parsons, mitigating, said: I cant put much of a gloss on this conduct. It is appalling. Simmons pleaded guilty to common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, making threats to kill, two malicious communications offences and affray. He had a history of violence against former partners, including headbutting and biting one and strangling her to unconsciousness, and attacking another while she was pregnant. Jailing Simmons for four and a half years, Recorder Caroline Wigin told him: Your history shows you to have demonstrated sadistic violence, intimidatory and controlling behaviour to several female partners. You have a history of minimising your culpability for such offending and blaming those partners. I find that you present a signicant risk of causing serious harm by committing further specied offences. Simmons is the cousin of double murderer Phillip Simmons, who was jailed for at least  years last year after killing two men in the yard of his west Hull home, nearly decapitating one of them with a spade.

The woman fled an abusive relationship to start a new le in Manchester with her seven-year-old son. But within weeks she became suicidal and even contemplated becoming a sex worker to make ends meet. Last month, she felt so low she even considered taking her and her son’s lives. She currently relies on food banks to feed them both. With a payment of just pound, per month, she has to pay pound in rent as well as bills and food - and goes into arrears every month. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  The cruel Universal Credit system has left her unable to feed her little boy and suffering with crippling anxiety as she worries about how to get through each day. And while she found herself contemplating ending it all, she said she could never actually go through with killing her smiling little boy. The woman, who did not wish to be named, told the Daily Mirror: “I’ve never been so low in my whole le. “A few months ago I was going to kill myself and my son because I couldn’t deal with it. “But when I go and pick my boy up from school and he smiles at me, it builds me and I think, I can’t do that to him - I’m not a killer.  “I’ve been to the doctor and I’m on antidepressants and they’re helping but I feel like I’m just in a nightmare. “Every month my money comes in and within the week its gone. And I dont have anything for the next three weeks, Ive got nothing to feed my son.” When she phoned the DWP to tell them about her situation, they told her to contact Citizens Advice who would tell her where to get food. She continued: “I’ve not paid electricity for a while. I go to a food bank down the road, and going in there makes me feel like I’m the worst person, the worst mum. I live day by day. I don’t eat breakfast, I just try and get enough food for an evening meal. “I’ve even thought about selling my body. I haven’t done it up to now but I don’t see any change, I don’t know what  to do.”  The heartbroken mum is currently looking for work but struggles to find a position that works around school hours. I’m hoping I can get something, in the meantime I’m always just so angry and sad.” After fleeing a violent and emotionally abusive relationship, she is now stuck in a new nightmare thanks to Universal Credit which leaves her “unable to provide for my son”. The mum-of-one was initially told she could access an advance payment of around pound when she needed it and then pay back in her monthly payments. However, after taking some money from it while waiting for her first payment, her access was revoked, leaving her without any financial security. “When they told me I couldn’t access it, I had nothing. I went to bed hungry that night. You just feel like nobody cares,” she said.  “The old system was perfect, I had enough money to pay my bills and buy food. I had no issues - I’d say I’m down at least pound per month on the new system. “Now I’m always thinking,I had pound, I could get so much food with that money and people just throw that around on coffee or whatever like it’s nothing.” A DWP spokesperson said: “The reasons why people use food banks are complex, so it’s wrong to link a rise to any one cause. Mental health is a key priority and we’re committed to ensuring people get the support they need, which is why we’re spending a record poundbillion this year in England.

This is to protect the claimant building up arrears. Budgeting advances are available to help cover essential needs and ensure that claimants have support straight away.” The Mirror has launched a campaign to halt a major rollout of Universal Credit before it hits million families from July .

The -year-old killer was handed five le sentences without the possibility of parole for murdering we Shanann, , along with their daughters Bella, four, and Celeste, three. Watts cried and shook in court as he listened to Shananns father, Frank Rzucek, speak about how his pregnant daughter and granddaughters lives were taken by an evil, heartless monster who took their bodies out like the trash. Frank said: God only knows what happened that night but le will never be the same. They had all their lives to live. They were taken by a heartless one, taken by an evil monster the heartless monster. You took them out like trash - you disgust me.  They were loving and caring people. You may have taken their bodies from them, but you have never taken the love they had for me you monster. You heartless monster you have to live with this vision every day of your le. You have no heart or feelings - prison is too good for you. Shananns mother also spoke to the court and addressed Watts, in part saying: Your faithful we trusted you, your daughters trusted you. I have no idea who gave you the right to take their lives, but I know God and his mighty angels were there at that moment to bring them home to paradise. Not only did you take your family of four, you took your own le. I want the world to know our daughter and her children were so loved by us. Watts parents Ronnie and Cindy also made a statament. It read: We are not here to ask for leniency we are not condoning or tolerating the crime that occurred and the pain caused we join in our daughter in law and grandchildrens family in saying this should never have happened. Theyaccept their son has done this they accept their son chose to plead guilty. They appreciate he is given the opportunity to serve this sentence.  It is not enough to make up for what he has done. Cindy Watts continued: This is something we will never get over, we will always mourn the loss of our family. I am still struggling to understand why and how this tragedy occurred. To my son Chris I have known you since the day you were born. You were a good friend, brother, father and son. I have loved you from the beginning and we still love you now. This might be hard for some to understand how I can sit here and tell you we are heartbroken. We cant imagine what could have led us to this day but we love you. As your mother Chris, I have always loved you and still do. I hate what has happened, we are struggling to understand but we will remain faithful as your family. We love you and we forgive you son. The court heard how Shanann was strangled to death, while his young girls were smothered. The court heard how Bella had fought for her le and bit her tongue during the struggle against her father.Imagine the horror in Bellas mind as her father took her last breaths away, a prosecutor said at Mondays sentencing, adding that Bella fought back for her le. Judge Marcelo Kopcow: This is perhaps the most inhumane and vicious crime that I have handled out of the thousands of cases that I have seen. Watts pleaded guilty to nine counts in total - including three counts of first degree murder after deliberation, two counts of first degree murder - a victim under  in a position of trust, one count of first-degree unlawful termination of a pregnancy and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body.  Speaking at a plea hearing where Watts pleaded guilty in exchange to avoid the death penalty, Judicial District Attorney Michael Rourke said: He deserves a le sentence for each and every act on top of each other. It was important that each of those beautul human beings was respected in that sentence. Watts buried his we in a shallow grave and stuffed his dead daughters in oil tanks where he worked, officials previously said. Their bodies were discovered days after the trio were reported missing from their home in Frederick, Colorado. After the trio vanished, Watts made a tearful TV plea to find them. Days later, on August , he was arrested but denied he had killed them.  But things then took a sinister turn and he repeatedly changed his story to police. He claimed that his we had strangled their daughters in revenge after he revealed he was having an affair and wanted to split. He allegedly told detectives that he flew into a rage and strangled Shanann after catching her in the act on a baby monitor screen. But police rejected his story and charged him with three counts of first-degree murder.

The helpless animals are forced to trot around in circles while carrying children and teenagers for four-hours a day, according to Chengdu Business Daily.

Zhou Bo, a manager at Tian Xiao Equestrian, said: Horses should be walked while willingly following their trainers commands. This makes sure their joints remain in a relaxed state.

The dad-of-three is the lead plaintf in the newly certied lawsuit and says he eats at McDonalds about once every two weeks at the insistence of his children, according to the court documents. He estimates he has spent hundreds of dollars on Happy Meals, which are childrens meals that come with toys.  Mr Bramante’s main issue is that the toys that come with the meals are mainly linked to popular film releases meaning children are desperate to get their hands on a “full set”. He also claims the restaurant is directly targeting children by displaying the Happy Meals toys at their eye level. Mr Bramante’s lawyer is arguing that the easiest thing to “give in to” is feeding your children and that parents have to “choose their battles”.

he does believe most Arabs will be in their usual seats at Tannadice and providing the kind of backing that’s become the envy of the rest of the second tier.“You have that Scotland game but the fans have been brilliant since I came in,” he said.“We took nearly , fans up to Ross County last weekend and we took , to Dunfermline the other week as well.“We’ve had great backing at home as well and, hopefully, they will turn up in numbers.“I understand midweek football means it’s always dficult for fans to make the journey.“We hope we can prove to them thatthey come along we’ll try to entertain and try to get a result.”As good as the backing so far has been, the manager does stress it remains down to his team to always make sure the supporters in the stands are given something to shout about.“The fans can make a massive dference but the initial stage will come from the players because the players, in the first  minutes of the game, have to set the tone,” he said.“They have to set the intensity and they have to get the fans off their seats.“If we can do that it reciprocates from the fans and we start putting pressure on teams and that’s what we need.”And that experience of playing with Hearts tells himthe support is on top form, at times it can mean points are picked up before a ball is even kicked.“I’ve played in venues where teams have come and you knew, because of the atmosphere and intensity, the game was done in the warm-up,” he said.“You knew you were going to win the game because the opposition couldn’t handle the atmosphere.“We need the supporters to try to give us that and we know they can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bf2bc8421f0d.jpg ","title":"nicola sturgeon opens new major trauma centre in

services","story":"If you were in charge of the council budget, how would you balance the books and keep everyone happy  vw, px\"  That’s the question Dundee City Council is putting to locals with a new online questionnaire, Conversation with the City, which asks taxpayers to prioritise public services including housing, street cleaning and education.Participants can even choose how much more council tax they would be willing to pay, from zero to more than %.The authority insists that far from being a box-ticking exercise, the survey will be used to help shape the council’s financial priorities for the year ahead.Finance spokesman Willie Sawers said: “We’re asking about the services that people value the most.“People have to recognise that the more money they pay into the council the better level of service we can provide.“The council doesn’t set charges for the sake of it – and often the charges we levy for services don’t actually cover the cost of the service itself.“The money that comes in through charges is used to provide services, so the survey is designed to reflect the dficult decisions the council has to make in the current harsh financial climate.”In an ideal world, telling the council you want to pay as little as possible for everything would result in a cheaper tax bill.However, while the survey will be used to inform the budget, the council isn’t quite handing all the power to the people.Mr Sawers would not be drawn on the extent to which the residents’ feedback will be implemented.“How influential the survey is will depend on the response rate – we would have to balance out the income we’re spending on services with what people say,” he said.Nearly half of council tax bills goes towards children and family services such as education.About a fth goes into providing health and social care services and just under % goes into neighbourhood services such as parks and housing. More goes into council administration, road repairs and capital projects such as building schools.The distribution of those funds is not fixed, meaning Dundonians could potentially have a real say in where their money goes.Askedthe council was shying away from making its own dficult decisions, Mr Sawers said: “We want to know what people’s priorities are but we’re not asking them to decide everything.“We’re not asking people to make every last decision for us – it’s not like we’re sticking  pages of questions on this survey and asking for changes on everything we do.“And many of the people who are most reliant on our services could be less representative then others in responding to the survey. We are aware of that.”The consultation has been partly inspired by the Dundee Decides survey, where residents voted on what projects they wanted to see funded by the council’s £ million community fund.Mr Sawers said: “If you look at the turnout at council elections, it is a lot lower than UK or Scottish elections. That indicates that there’s a disconnect between people and councils.“The survey is another way for us to engage with the public and spell out our range of services, by discussing them outwith our own organisation.“Going forward in future years, we’ll be looking at the types of questions we ask too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures dundee youngsters have a ball during in service days","story":"Football camps and fun sessions were among the activities organised by Leisure and Culture Dundee to keep children occupied during school in-service days on Thursday and Friday.The football camps at Dundee International Sports Centrewere open to youngsters aged from five- and they had a ball.Boys and girls took part in a series of games to test their skills and also learn some new ones.Fun sessions in the McTaggart Centre on Old Glamis Road – open to families with kids aged  and younger – were also fully booked."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed arsenal watched dundee prospect kerr waddell","story":"Dundee kid Kerr Waddell was watched by English Premier League giants Arsenal during the summer.And the -year-old’s progress continues to be monitored by a string of clubs from south of the border.Wednesday saw Waddell extend his loan at Championship outfit Morton until the end of the season, a move that will free him up to play in the Scottish Cup as well as league matches.Waddell made his temporary switch to Greenock, at first on a six-month deal, in early July but initially it had been pencilled in for a few weeks earlier so he could join the Ton at the start of their pre-season training programme.The loan was delayed, however, and he played in the Dark Blues opening build up game at Brechin City at the end of June, when he was watched by Gunners scouts.That was with a view to adding him to their U  squad and although the spying mission did not lead to an offer being tabled, Arsenal and others down south have been keeping tabs on his progress at Morton.New Dundee boss Jim McIntyre has also had reports on him but with good options available in defence, he’s decided the player’s development will be best served by remaining at Morton until the end of the season.Waddell broke into the first team at Dens early last season and got the goals that earned a vital win over Hearts a year past September.Injury and the arrival of experienced central defensive pair Genseric Kusunga and Steven Caulker in the early weeks of this year, saw his appearances in the second half of the campaign dry up.At Morton he’s made  appearances so far this term.The Dens gaffer has said he’s keeping an eye on all his players out on loan to see what they might add to the first-team should they be recalled in January.He said: “We send people to go and watch them so we are getting proper feedback.“Ideally, going forward I would like a position created for the loan players, somebody who keeps an eye on them so we are getting reports on each game.“The possibility is there for bringing them back but they need to be doing well where they are.”n Glen Kamara played  minutes for Finland last night in their -

ball about really well.“We scored some good goals which came from some good passing moves so I’m really pleased with the performance.“Credit to Turrf, they came to play football and have a go.“We did manage to create opportunities and take them.“But they are a good young team who just need time to learn and gain experience, but there is no question we were clinical.”Turrf manager Kris Hunter said: “I’m very disappointed, but for  minutes we did well and played good football.“We let Cove get a couple of goals that were avoidable and after that Cove showed their class.“They’ve got that many good attacking players going forward and we just couldn’t handle them defensively.“We tried to play football out from the back, but we got punished by a very good team.“They’ve got so much quality, cause you problems and they are the best team in the league.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bumper new scottish football tv deals agreed","story":"The SPFL has agreed new TV deals for Scottish football which are said to be the biggest broadcast investment for more than  years.New deals to show the Premiership, Betfred Cup and Irn-Bru Cup have been signed and are understood to be worth £million per season until .The contracts start from season   with Sky Sports agreeing an exclusive deal to show  Premiership matches per season as well up to six Premiership play-off matches.Premier Sports, who last week penned a deal to show the Scottish Cup, have taken over the Betfred Cup contract and will show between  and  live games as well as highlights.BBC Scotland have extended their existing TV highlights

from the Championship, League One and League Two play-offs.SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: “Every single deal is a major increase on our current contracts.“Taken together, these deals represent the largest ever injection of broadcast investment since the SPL was founded over  years ago.“Whilst we are not in a position to reveal exact figures, it’s indicative of the sums involved that the clubs quickly voted to accept the deals put before them.“Interest in the Scottish game is extremely high both at home and overseas.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

It was the first time we’ve performed an entire set of all our own work, which was pretty special.#Kirsteen said: #MOJO and the reception we got performing our own music for the first time was very special.#When asked where they would most like to perform, there was some surprisingly touching answers.Alana said: #I personally would love to play in Nashville, the country capital in the Bluebird Cafe.

Fiona Coughtrie, , and Stephen Thomson, , were caught metres away from targeted store Aldi in Prestwick after pinching the generator on June . The blundering thieves made attempts at a getaway but were snared a short distance away at the traffic lights on Ayr Road. Ayr Sherf Court heard the stolen electrical device was worth pound.. Defending Coughtrie, of Galloway Avenue, solicitor Tony Currie said: “Slightly unusual as I don’t think either of them have a caravan. “It requested both of them to carry the item out of the shop. “This is an offence that was against a background of a chaotic lestyle and drug issues.” Mr Currie explained the pair were then caught “literally straight at the traffic lights”. Sherf John Montgomery commented the theft attempt was “rather pathetic”. Defending Thomson, of Elba Gardens in Ayr, solicitor Ian Gillies said: “Mr Thomson and Miss Coughtrie were living together but they’ve decided to part – and I don’t think that’s a bad thing.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

general inspection since .MP John Lamont believes the figures show the Scottish Government is failing Borders pupils.He said: ldquoParents in the Borders will find it shocking that one in five schools have been waiting more than a decade for an assessment by Education Scotland.\"While I understand that inspections can be stressful for teachers, they need to be taking place more regularly than they are.\"Inspections are vital for parents to make an informed choice about their childrsquos education.\"Many young families look at these reports before a potential move and with so many out of date in the Borders, it can only be putting people off.\"But our hard-working teachers are also being let down because inspections provide important feedback and advice.\"Among the  local schools which havent been fully inspected in the past decade are Hawick High School , Priorsford Primary , Stow Primary , Walkerburn Primary , Broomlands Primary , Fountainhall Primary , Jedburgh Grammar Schooland Eyemouth High .Its also been nine years since Berwickshire High was inspected, eight years since Earlston High, seven years since either Peebles High or Kelso High were visited and five years since

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo.

What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire.

It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Oliver looks way younger than  years on this planet would suggest, and is relaxed, yet on the clock, given one of his brood has to picked up from school in an hour.He certainly has the energy to undertake a tour of the great theatre halls of the land with his new show, telling of the British Isles in  Places, Glasgow this week which expands upon the detail in his new book of the same title. But his is all new to him  ldquoIrsquove spoken in public before, at literary festivals, but not night after night, he says. ldquoI only get a couple of days off during the months and itrsquos quite intense and nerve wracking. Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views. Indeed, this bustling port on the Isle of Lewis has a thriving arts, culture and food scene that puts many bigger mainland towns to shame.Itrsquos also a place to soak up Gaelic hospitality, history and tradition, while appreciating the ever-changing terrains of this magical, wind-swept isle.Historical HighlightsKnown as Stjoacuternavaacutegr, or ldquosteering bay in Old Norse, Stornoway was founded by the Vikings in the early th century, people have inhabited Lewis for around  years.The main street, Cromwell Street, is named for Oliver Cromwell, whose forces fought to take control of the town in .Owned by the Mackenzies of Seaforth for more than  years, Lewis was sold to Sir James Matheson for pound, in . The new laird built Lews Castle, which still overlooks the bay, as well as many of the islandrsquos roads and schools.With its sheltered harbour and strategic location, Stornoway played a key role in both world wars. On New Yearrsquos Day , HMY Iolaire ndash Gaelic for eagle ndash sank in the harbour, killing at least  men ing home from the First World War.Oban guideAccording to the  census,  per cent of residents in greater Stornoway speak Gaelic.

The Sail Stornoway festival takes place every July, attracting hundreds of boats from all over Scotland and beyond.As you take in the sights and smells of the seafront there are plenty of places to stop for coffee, snacks or fish and chips. Itrsquos also worth walking up to the headland at the Holm Point end, where the poignant memorial to the Iolaire disaster stands.The walk along the seafront also takes you straight to An Lanntair , the arts, culture and community hub that opened in .

If yoursquore feeling lazy, a guided Segway touris the ideal way to whizz around. Therersquos a great cafeacute, too, which has ldquothe best scones in Stornoway, according to Jan Patience.Itrsquos worth remembering that many people on Lewis are very religious and consider Sunday to be a special day of the week. Most commercial activity stops, and the vast majority of businesses are closed, though ferries and flights now operate.Where to eatThe Cafeacute Bar at An Lanntair is a relaxed affair that serves delicious food from am till pm, complete with great sea views. The chowder, made with local ingredients, is a hearty meal in itself.Seafood fans are certainly spoiled for choice in Stornoway. Upmarket Digby Chick , run by chef-proprietor James Mackenzie, showcases the best of locally caught fish and shellfish.

I do not believe that everyone who graduated this year has sufficient skills in numeracy to be able to teach it to -year-olds at a reasonable standard.Cue bedlam. Here for the first time was a suggestion the slide in standards could be laid at the door of poorly prepared trainee teachers unable to pass on the essential skills required to make pupils literate and numerate.Even tabloid newspapers became interested in teacher training with the front page of next days Daily Record berating the Scottish Government under the headline \"You Do The Maths\".Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson seized the moment demanding new literacy and numeracy tests for primary teachers at the beginning and end of their course.There was even graver concern when the education committee received a follow-up report from universities which said student teachers on some four-year degree courses could spend as little as  hours on numeracy and  hours on literacy.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he was ldquovery concerned by the findings and raised the issue with both universities and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.More than a year on and there is still resentment from some involved in teacher education over the way the issue played out.\"The students were not a representative sample,\" one member of university staff said. \"They were a very specic group who had already written to complain to the committee and they were the only ones selected to speak. It was unfortunate and we are still dealing with the consequences.\"Professor Ian Rivers, chairman of the Scottish Council of Deans of Education, is also concerned about the weight given to some of the statements made to the committee.\"There was no actual evidence that teachers who leave university are unable to teach -year-olds to the appropriate standard,\" he said. \"Every university does its absolute best, working in partnership with experienced teachers, to make sure our students leave able to meet the requirements and professional standards expected of them.\"The committee wanted the literacy and numeracy work we do neatly calculated in terms of the number of hours we deliver, but that is a very narrow view of what we do. All of the work on literacy, numeracy is integrated into the course as a whole so it is very dficult to provide what they wanted. That does not mean that literacy and numeracy is being ignored.\"Mr Rivers also questions the current narrative from headteachers and council officials that the quality of new teachers is not what it was.Local authorities have recorded an increase in the number of probationers having to repeat a year because they were not seen as being of an appropriate standard and school leaders have also raised concerns over quality.ldquoWe do not allow anyone to graduatetheir practice is not up to scratch and that is done with assessments by a member of academic staff from the university in partnership with the classroom teacher they have been working with,\" said Mr Rivers.\"It is very important to understand that teacher education is the starting point of a journey and not the end point. When students are on probation councils are also heavily involved in the development of skills and knowledge as the teacher moves towards becoming a fully registered member of the profession.\"The other concern that has unsettled public confidence in teacher education is drop-out rates. Figures published earlier this year showed the number of new teachers leaving after less than a year had doubled in just four years. In total, almost  probationers have left the profession since the   school year.While the reasons for leaving are not given a wider survey of probationers conducted last year highlighted a number of worrying concerns about the quality of courses and the experience of probationers in schools.Some trainees told how their ldquoappalling experiences at the hands of disinterested lecturers and on placement in classrooms had made them re-think their career path. One said veteran teachers had told them to ldquoleave whilst you still can while another suggested bullying was re within the profession and staff rooms a \"poisonous environment\".The Scottish Council of Deans of Education argues that the drop out rates are not particularly high and are generally stable. However, they acknowledge a growing concern over the ever-increasing demands placed on trainee teachers and the requirement that universities provide the Scottish Government with evidence of how they are addressing a iety of additional areas including looked after children, children with autism, LBGTI pupils, black and ethnic minority pupils and pupils with mental health issues.Moyra Boland, a senior lecturer from Glasgow Universityrsquos School of Education, said all of these areas were crucial, but questioned whether it was wise to try and cram them all into a one-year postgraduate course.She said: \"You can never get everything into the curriculum. That will never happen because there is so much to know in schools and it is such a complicated job. You never stop learning as a teacher because every class provides new challenges with new combinations of children.\"Rather than thinking about covering absolutely everything in initial teacher education in Glasgow we are much more focused on how we give our students the skills and dispositions to find the knowledge that they need to support their changing classrooms from year to year.\"Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland , also has concerns over what is expected of trainee teachers and believes the time is ripe for a wider review.He said: \"It would be a good time to look at whether the current system of a one year postgraduate followed by a one year probationary year adequately prepares teachers for the range of youngsters and experiences they will face.\"There are huge added responsibilities on teachers, and therefore on teacher education programmes, and an expectation that everything has to be covered which creates pressures and dficulties.ldquoWe need to stand back and ask,we want teachers to be skilled in covering a wide range of areas from sex education to additional support needs, can we cram all that into an  week university postgraduate programme \"Mr Muir said one solution was to look at a longer period of induction that allowed teachers to undertake the additional studies they require once they were in school so they could focus on the areas most pertinent to the context of their schools.There is also more radical thinking on the current structure of initial teacher education.Professor Chris Chapman, chair of Educational Policy and Practice at Glasgow Universitys Robert Owen Centre, wants to see barriers broken down between universities and schools.\"If we are building new schools we should look at teacher preparation in the design of those buildings. You could have studio classrooms or experimental classrooms where trainee teachers are working with university staff and teachers in a more regular and dynamic way.\"I would like to see university staff co-located in schools and working much more closely on a day-to-day basis with teachers and student teachers and engaging with research. That would create a much more dynamic and reflective set of teachers.\"Raymond Soltysek, a former teaching lecturer at Strathclyde University and now an independent educational consultant, argues Scotland could go much further.He believes the inconsistencies highlighted in the way universities deliver basic skills is an indicator of a system where students at dferent institutions study dferent subjects for dferent s of time and are assessed in dferent ways.\"Perhaps more radical initiatives should be explored,\" he said. \"Many have suggested ious structural changes, including taking professional teacher training back into the public sector.\"However, a model of public ownership might take the form of a National College of Teacher Education ndash a central body run by the GTCS, councils, Education Scotland, teachersrsquo bodies and associations ndash which would centralise matters such as recruitment, course design, student placement coordination and assessment. That would provide much greater consistency in what is delivered across Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  May   s done the impossible - brought Leave and Remainers together  but only against her","story":"The Prime Minister made a dignied, resilient stand last week, before a House of Commons that loathes this proposal. But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

We are now all reaping the bitter harvest. The country has been landed with a bad deal and the unedying spectacle of a roguesrsquo gallery of hardline Brexiteers denouncing the product of their own actions.Parliamentary arithmetic means there is little hope of this deal surviving a vote in the Commons.With Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of the European Research Group in open rebellion, Dominic Raab joining an ever-growing list of former Brexit Ministers, and other Ministers going and gone, the Toriesrsquo time in Downing Street should surely be up. This is beyond a party political argument.So, of course, while there is an element of drama in watching the Tory party turning on itself, the problems of Theresa Mayrsquos deal are far more serious than that.One of Labourrsquos six tests for the Toriesrsquo Brexit is whether it delivers for all regions and nations of the UK. Theresa Mayrsquos negotiations have patently not produced a deal that delivers for the people of Scotland.Scottish Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal that best supports jobs and our economy. Which is why a few weeks after my election as Scottish Labour leader, I said that we needed a new comprehensive and permanent customs union ndash because you need that to protect our manufacturing industry and its supply chains. This would also be the cleanest and best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement.We also need a strong and stable single market relationship, one that is good for jobs in our service industries. And we need a deal that guarantees no erosion of workersrsquo and consumersrsquo rights and environmental standards.The Tories Brexit proposal delivers none of those things. For these reasons it has to be rejected by the House of Commons ndash and its why every one of Scotlandrsquos Members of Parliament, regardless of party, must vote down Theresa Mayrsquos deal.But the position of the Scottish Conservative Party is now totally untenable. Their leader, Ruth Davidson, and the Scottish Secretary David Mundell, threatened to resignthe deal did not protect the integrity of the UK. Theresa May ignored them ndash but so far they have clung on to their positions. It is remarkable that Dominic Raab has shown more backbone and integrity than either of Scotlandrsquos leading Tories.The SNPrsquos argument that there must be a separate deal for Scotland is not a matter of political principle. It is an exercise in cynical political posturing.For Scotland to be in a customs union, the logical position is for whole of the UK to be in customs union. A hard border between Scotland and the rest of UK would make even worse the economic damage of Brexit. And remember the UK single market is four times more important for Scotlandrsquos economy than the EU single market.But providing the SNP with the excuse to play fast and loose on this issue is yet another way in which Mayrsquos Brexit threatens the integrity of the UK.Should MPs vote the deal down then this would constitute a total loss of confidence in the Government. From there, the right outcome is a General Election so that the people can finish the job they started in  and sweep the Tories from power.A General Election and a change of government is necessary to break this Brexit deadlock and avoid the no deal outcome. A General Election and change of government would create the conditions for the European Union to stop the clock on Article  and to begin meaningful negotiations with a new government that can deliver a deal to parliament and the country.We need a deal that works for the whole of the UK and it is becoming increasingly clear that is something only an incoming Labour government can deliver."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-takes-swipe-at-tory-critics-ahead-of-critical-week-for-brexit","story":"The Prime Minister warned that a change of leadership would not make it easier to get a deal past parliament or the EU, after furious Brexiteer backbenchers started moves to remove her.She told Skyrsquos Ridge On Sunday that as far as she knew the -letter threshold for letters of no confidence needed to start a leadership battle had yet to be reached.In a message to those plotting her downfall, including members of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic MPs, she said she had not considered quitting.She added: ldquoA change of leadership at this point isnrsquot going to make the negotiations any easier and it isnrsquot going to change the parliamentary arithmetic.ldquoWhat it will do is bring in a degree of uncertainty.

If they fail to secure these and choose to resign, it could prove devastating for Downing Street.Last night it emerged frozen and chilled warehouses across the UK are running out of space as firms desperately seek to stockpile goods in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.Addressing a Confederation of British Industry conference today, Mrs May will acknowledge her Government faces \"an intense week of negotiations ahead of us in the run-up to the special European Council on Sunday\".She will say: \"During that time I expect us to hammer out the full and final details of the framework that will underpin our future relationship and I am confident we can strike a deal at the council that I can take back to the House of Commons.\"Ms Sturgeon reiterated her belief that Scotlands interests have been \"sidelined\" during the Brexit process, but she appeared to delay any imminent announcement on a second independence referendum.It came as the latest poll showed an increase in support for independence, but with a stubborn lead for staying in the UK.Britain Elects last night tweeted a Panelbase poll, from November -, saying the Scottish independence referendum voting intention stands at % for Yes and % for No.The First Minister previously indicated she would outline plans for another vote \"when Theresa May comes back and says Ive got the deal\".However speaking to the BBC, she said: \"I think its firstly appropriate to wait and see what the House of Commons does.\"This withdrawal agreement, as things stand right now, is not getting the approval of the Commons.\"Wait until the dust settles.

On Saturday, the Edinburgh-based newspaper was put into administration by its then-owners, Johnston Press, alongside a slew of other UK titles.The papers had been put up for sale a few weeks ago, but no potential buyer was willing or able to cover the poundm of debt attached, which was supposed to be re-paid next year.For a while, it looked as though the end was nigh for the -year-old Scotsman, as well as the Edinburgh |Evening News, the i-paper and the Yorkshire Post, another of the oldest papers in the UK, which serves a population the size of Scotland. Scores of other loyal local titles were also at risk.Later, a statement confirmed that a new company had been formed by Johnstonrsquos bondholders which, it seems, will preserve jobs and titles in the short-term. Whether there is a medium or indeed long-term future for the business remains less clear.Like most of those who work in the close-knit Scottish newspaper industry, I felt sad and a bit angry as the events unfolded. Sad that so many good, decent colleagues would be worrying about their jobs and wondering how they would look after their families, angry that they and the readers they serve had been put in this precarious situation in the first place.Make no mistake, those of us on the inside know all too well how the newspaper industry has struggled to respond to the huge challenges of the digital age, seeing our newsrooms reduce in size and scope as consumers stopped buying print products, advertising revenues fell and shareholders continued to expect big idends.But we also know how hard and tenaciously the journalists work to give readers quality news and comment in an increasingly uncertain world, how determined we are to evolve and carry on. Those of us who work for long-established brands are very aware that the trust our readers put in us, the authority we carry, has never been more valuable or vital than now, in todayrsquos fragmented, confusing world.With this in mind, journalists from up and down the land tweeted and retweeted messages of solidarity and empathy with colleagues at the Scotsman, while public figures from across the political ide, including the First Minister, also voiced support.It was shocking and dispiriting, therefore, to see others react with joy and even glee at news of the Scotsmanrsquos struggles, rushing to link the paperrsquos constitutional stance ndash it was against independence in the  referendum - with recent misfortunes, seemingly delighted to see two centuries of national journalism go down the tubes, all because they donrsquot agree with an editorial line.Taking aside the plain nastiness of revelling in the misfortune of others, the hubris and naivety inherent in this narrative is equally depressing. Do the authors of such social media threads truly believe failure to endorse a Yes vote in  has been instrumental in bringing down a mainstay in what they insist on calling the ldquomainsteam media, as opposed to economics and or poor management  Surelyit was a simple as this, my excellent colleagues at The National would be the bestselling newspaper in Scotland They seem to believe consumers buy newspapers solely on the basis of constitutional affiliation. Irsquove got news - they donrsquot.Isnrsquot it blatantly obvious that no publication is solely about its editorial stance  Thatrsquos simply not the way journalism or journalists work. Open any paper, tabloid or broadsheet, local or national, and you will find stories on an endless stream of subjects, written by people from every background and age bracket, race, gender and political persuasions, with a staggering array of interests, contacts and areas of expertise. The folk who write and edit newspapers are not perfect by any means ndash they are human and sometimes make mistakes. But in my experience the overwhelming majority thrive on interrogation and scrutiny. Indeed, thatrsquos why they became journalists in the first place.Those who relish the thought of newspapers disappearing should be very careful what they wish for. Do they honestly want to live in a society where only their own viewpoint is reflected, where positive coverage of the party, cause or person they support - be it independence, Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon or Donald Trump ndash is all they can cope with  Thatrsquos a dangerous and self-destructive road to go down, that is already blunting critical faculties and making us unable to handle complexity. It also makes us less kind.The digital world has given us a capacity for pluralism across newspaper brands, broadcasters and online outlets that is breathtaking. Ironically, social media is simultaneously driving us to shut down those we donrsquot agree with. We should resist this urge at all costs."},{"url":null,"title":"kelp-harvesting-bid-sparks-plea-from-sir-david-attenborough","story":"But one Scots company wants to harvest , tonnes of kelp off the west coast in a bid that has sparked controversy, amid concern for the preservation of these intricate systems, with Sir David Attenborough now stepping in to voice his concerns.It comes as Ayr-based Marine Biopolymersclaims Scotland could lose out on a pound million industryMSPs vote to ban the industrial harvesting of kelp in its waters.The firm wants to harvest the kelp using a revolutionary process it has developed to create a product that could be used to make ldquoinvisible armour or slow release cancer drugs.The nanocellulose it produces from the seaweed is the ldquobest in the world, it claims, and could have a whole host of possible applications ndash including an alternative to the vaginal mesh implants that have left some women in crippling pain.But MBL says this hi-tech new industrywill be haltedMSPs pass new legislation that bans dredging for kelp.After more than , people signed a petition against such dredging, Green MSP Mark Ruskell successfully amended the Scottish Crown Estate Bill to ban the removal of entire kelp plants.Veteran naturalist Sir David Attenborough has also lent his voiceto the cause, speaking to Fauna  Flora International , of which he is vice-president, saying: ldquoCharles Darwin was one of the first people to recognise just how important kelp forests are for our oceans, comparing them in ersity to rainforests.ldquoThese kelp forests, which can be found right here, around the coast of the British Isles, not only form an important part of the food chain, but also act as a vital habitat for a wide array of species.ldquoTheir thick foliage offers food and safety from predators, and provides a nursery ground where juvenile fish can mature in safety.ldquoLook closely among the intricate stems and fronds of kelp, and you will find a range of fascinating sea le, from invertebrates such as sea stars, anemones and limpets, to mammals such as sea otters.ldquoMany of the fish species, suchas cod, that are so important to us economically and culturally are alsofound here.ldquoFor these reasons and many morendash carbon storage being just one ndash it is imperative we protect our kelp forests.But MBL co-founder David Mackie insisted its plans to harvest the seaweed laminaria hyperborea are ldquoentirely sustainable, saying there is an estimated  million tonnes of it in Scotlandrsquoswaters.The kelp, which he described as ldquothe daddy of the seaweeds in Scottish waters, grows up to ft long, with the plants attaching themselves to rocky surfaces.He said: ldquoPeople say we intend to dredge. Well you canrsquot dredge a rocky bottom, so wersquore not doing that.As MBL developed its processes to remove alginate from the seaweed, it found marine cellulose was also produced.Dr Mark Dorris, a senior research fellow and lecturer in material science at Edinburghrsquos Napier University, has been working with that to create new bioplastic materials, the starting point of which are fibres that are ,th of the width of a human hair.Wood pulp is already used to produce nanocellulose, but Dr Dorris said when kelp is used the end result is ldquobetter than any nanocellulose in the world.This raw product can be turned into bioplastics to be used in food packagingfor products such as sandwiches andready meals, but work has also beentaking place with the Ministry of Defence to develop a ldquotransparent armourthat could be used for helmet visors and body shields by police and the armed services.The nanocellulose could also be usedto develop slow release drugs for treating colon cancer, as well as to helpconserve fragile, historic documentsand artefacts.Dr Dorris said: ldquoTherersquos loads of applications for this, medical implants, meshes. This stuff, because it is made from seaweed, is biocompatible, the wood cellulose isnrsquot.But Mr Mackie said he fears plans to develop such products could be haltedMSPs vote through the legislation as it currently stands on Wednesday.He said: ldquoWe worked long and hard to develop our process, basically we have turned the whole alginate processing upside down, to get to what is unique, nobody  does it.ldquoWersquove got this brilliant raw material, we do a wee bit of magic with it.ldquoThis is the thing I am most proud of that we have done, and when I see what these guys can do it is just incredible.For Sir David, though, his concerns for kelp remain.He said: ldquoIt is perfectly possible to harvest them sustainably by removing their fronds while leaving the rest of the plant intact.ldquoBut dredging ndash or indeed any kind of harvesting that removes the whole plant ndash is a wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds.ldquoI urge decision makers to take the necessary action to protect these vital,and globally important, habitats."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-why-this-brexit-fiasco-could-eventually-give-us-all-peace-of-mind","story":"Forty-seven years on from that revealing little moment in political history, Theresa May now faces a vote of her own in the Commons to pretty much undo all of Ted Heathrsquos work and it makes you wonder what music might be appropriate this time round. Messiaenrsquos Quartet for the End of Time perhaps. Or John Cagersquos piece for organ, As Slow as Possible, which takes  years to perform. Or maybe even Eh-Oh by the Teletubbies. Any of them might symbolise the mess wersquore in now: the disorder, the ision, the dragged-out damage.To make some sense of it all, it might be useful to remember what Edward Heath thought he had achieved in  as well as the approach he took to some of the controversies that are still with us, such as referendums. Mr Heath said in lsquo that he believed the British people would eventually see the wider benefits of the European Community, particularly peace and prosperity. ldquoI believe they will become convinced that this is where the future of modern Britain lies, he said.For a while, they did, although Ted Heath did have to fight hard to win a majority in the Commons. He also resisted the pressure to hold a referendum, which some said was the only way to avoid the claim that the Government was dragging the country into the Common Market against its will. Mr Heath took a view that now looks impossibly elitist or hugely realistic: in a parliamentary democracy, he said, it would be irresponsible to leave a decision on so critical and complex an issue to the electorate.It obviously wouldnrsquot be easy for a politician to express that kind of view now, but there are lessons for Theresa May to learn from Ted Heathrsquos experiences ndash not easy ones though. Specically, in one respect Mrs Mayneeds to do exactly the same as Ted Heath did, which is to aim for the reasonable centre of the electorate, which still exists and which supports remaining in the EU, a soft Brexit, or some pragmatic compromise.However, it now looks like she can only achieve that result , in another respect, she does exactly the opposite to Ted Heath. Heath thought referendums contradicted the principles of parliamentary democracy ndash and they do ndash but in the circumstances wersquore in, another public vote is the only way to get us away from the extremes of Brexit. In fact, a second vote may end up being one of the few redeeming features of this process by recalibrating us back to where all the good and sensible stuff happens in politics: the centre ground.It is likely to happen because of the logistics of where we are. Theresa May did not ndash and realistically could not ndash stick to her Remain principles when she took over as leader of the Conservative party, but she has achieved the best deal in the circumstances ndash some of which were unavoidable, some of which were self-inflicted.The unavoidable bit was the UKrsquos border with Ireland ndash a hard border is impossible without being a member of the customs union ndash whereas the self-inflicted bit was Mrs Mayrsquos insistence on ending the free movement of people, which ruled out membership of the single market. In this version of our world ndash part reality, part unreality created by Mrs May ndash the deal we have is the only practical option.All of that means that the next few stages in the process are pretty much inevitable. Mrs May is still trying to appease Brexiters by promising that a wonderful free trade deal is still on the horizon but unless we can reach a deal that avoids a hard border in Ireland ndash and no one has come up with one ndash then, under Mrs Mayrsquos plan, Britain will eventually enter the backstop outlined in the withdrawal agreement. Realistically, the backstop is also likely to form the basis of the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU: in other words, a UK-wide customs union with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market.However, we know, and Mrs May knows, that there is no majority in the Commons for that, which leaves only four options: three unlikely and one almost inevitable. The unlikely options are, first, a no-deal Brexitsecond, a re-negotiation of the deal, which the EU has already ruled out whatever Andrea Leadsom says and third, a general election, which neither Theresa May nor any other Tory PM would go for.Which leaves us with the fourth option: another referendum. Ted Heath was right to resist one when he was PM, but  years on, another public vote will soon be Mrs Mayrsquos only choice. She cannot appeal to the right-wing extremists who think the same way about Brexit as some Christian evangelists think about gay-cure therapy ndash that the facts of le can be changed by faith. In insisting on her version of Brexit, she has also ruled out support from the hardcore Remainers and the SNP.However, increating a situation where a second vote on Brexit is now the only option, Mrs May could be doing us all a favour. There is always a chance the result will be another vote for Leave, but the polls show a vote for Remain is increasingly likely. If so, that could help quieten the extremists of all kinds ndash Brexiter, Socialist, Northern Irish Unionist and Scottish Nationalist ndash and take us back to the centre of politics. A good result in a second referendum on Brexit might also achieve a little of what Edward Heath felt in Number  on the evening of th October : a sense that the world is in the right order, a feeling that we are doing whatrsquos best for Britain, and maybe even some longed-for peace of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-says-her-brexit-plan-is-best-for-britains-jobs-as-she-faces-critical-week","story":"In a message to her political rivals, the Prime Minister stressed that Brexit was not an exercise in \"political theory\" but something that affected peoples lives and livelihoods.In Brussels, Michel Barnier, the European Unions chief negotiator, said the Brexit process was at a \"key moment\" and urged all sides to remain \"calm\".One of the remaining details to be resolved is how long a possible extension to the transition period - effectively keeping the UK aligned with the EU after Brexit - could last for. This is an option because, in theory, it would help avoid having to have a backstop period.Intriguingly, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, talked up the prospect, saying it had ldquooption value.There has been speculation that a one-off extension,sought when the agreed transition period expired at the end of , could last until the end of .Mrs May conspicuously did not knock the idea down but stressed she would want it to be over by the time of the next scheduled general election in June , while Mr Barnier said an extension could not be \"indefinite\" and a deadline would be decided in talks this week.However, a question hangs over whether or not extending the transition would mean putting off the day the UK took back full control of its fishing waters.At present, Britain will become an independent coastal state on Brexit Day. However, the UK Government has agreed that for the transition period the countryrsquos fishing industry will comply with the regime of the hated Common Fisheries Policy until December .Given that quotas are set in December for the following  months, any extension to the transition could mean that UK fishermen would be bound by the CFP for another year. If, as Mr Barnier has suggested, the transition might extend to December , this could mean the UK adhering to CFP rules until December  more than seven years after the  vote to leave the EU.Any extension to the transition that meant UK fishermen continuing to abide by CFP rules would be anathema to Scottish Conservatives, who have threatened to vote against Mrs Mayrsquos proposed deal,this were the case.But it has been suggested the draft withdrawal agreement ldquokicks the can down the road as it simply says on the future of fisheries that both sides would use their ldquobest endeavours to come up with what happens beyond December  with an agreed plan by July .Mr Barnier and others have flagged up the possibility of slapping tarfs on UK fishing productsthere is no guarantee of continued access for EU boats to UK waters.This morning, the PM took her Brexit message to the CBI conference as she sought to win business backing for her plans.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the event in east London: \"It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress.\"She said firms were already spending hundreds of millions on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.In her keynote speech, Mrs May said: \"We are not talking about political theory but the reality of peoples lives and livelihoods. Jobs depend on us getting this right.\"And what we have agreed unashamedly puts our future economic success, and the livelihoods of working families up and down this country, first.\"But Brexit-supporting businessman Roger Kendrick challenged her over her plans, which he said would restrict the ability to strike trade deals with countries outside the EU, telling Mrs May: \"Think again about the economics of the whole thing.\"The PM told him: \"The portrayal that you have given of what has been agreed is a little inaccurate,\" adding: \"It makes sense for us to continue having a good trading relationship with the European Union...but also have the freedom, which we will have, to sign those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"In Brussels, Mr Barnier updated ministers from the  remaining EU nations on the state of the Brexit process.Austrian EU minister Gernot Blumel said it was \"a painful week in European politics\" and \"we have the orce papers on the table,  years of dficult marriage are coming to an end\".Luxembourgs foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said: \"This deal that is now on the table is the best there is. There is no better deal for this crazy Brexit.\"Askedhe thought Mrs May could survive, Mr Asselborn said: \"I believe she can convince her party and perhaps a part of parliament which is not on her side, so that this deal can become reality.\"The question of Mrs Mays survival is one that the EU are watching closely as Tory rebels continued to attack her plan although there still remained doubt as to whether or not they had the  signatories needed to spark a no-confidence vote. A total of  have gone public. Some MPs who were said to have put in letters to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee, refused to confirm publicly they had done so.The message from both the PM and the EU representatives in Brussels was that there could be no unpicking of the orce deal, although work on the blueprint for the future relationship continues.Mrs May made clear the proposed withdrawal plan had been \"agreed in full\" by both sides.However, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said: \"This deal is not what the people voted for. It will tie us to the customs union for years to come with no way out.\"But there is still time to negotiate a Canada+++ deal that delivers on the referendum. So lets get on with it.\"And Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, made yet another colourful attack on her plan.He used a column in Mondaysto describe the agreement as a \"-page fig leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat\".Calling for the scrapping of the Northern Ireland backstop, he added: \"We should massively accelerate our preparations to exit on World Trade Organisation terms, with a new Secretary of State responsible for all the cross-government work.\"There would, of course, be some disruption in that outcome, but by no means as much as sometimes predicted.\"And it is our failure to make proper preparations that has so gravely weakened our negotiations.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9061484.jpg?type=article-full","title":"facebooks-45m-fund-for-80-local-newspaper-jobs","story":"Newspaper companies and the National Council for the Training of Journalists will run the pilot scheme designed to bring more local reporters to communities.Recruits will have ied levels of education and experience and the NCTJ will steer and assess training.Called the Community News Project, it could be extendedsuccessful.Read more:Reporters to be hired as part of the BBCs local democracy talent poolNewsquest, JPIMedia, Reach, Archant and the Midland News Association have joined the scheme.The goal is to boost newsgathering from towns and villages \"which have lost their local newspaper or beat reporters\".Nick Wrenn, head of news partnerships at Facebook, above, said: \"Local newspapers keep people up to date on everything thats going on in a community, but also play a vital role in holding local councils and institutions to account.\"We recognise the important role Facebook plays in how people get their news today, and we want to do more to support local publishers.\"Sian Cox-Brooker, strategic partner manager at Facebook, said that local news \"is also the best way of finding out what is going on in your community\".She said: \"At Facebook we know that it is what people want to read.\"The news comes as the Cairncross Review, under the chairmanship of Dame Frances Cairncross, is looking at how to sustain high-quality journalism in a changing market.Read more:Facebook linking to more local news sitesToby Granville, editorial director at Newsquest, parent company of Herald and Times, said: \"This initiative will mean that we can e deeper into our communities to engage with them about what matters most at a more granular level.\"These new journalists will be able to help fill a void of rich content while establishing new audiences in otherwise untapped areas and help build a sustainable future for community news.\"The NCTJ and publishers will focus on recruiting trainees from a range of backgrounds, designed to reflect the ersity of local communities.Joanne Butcher, chief executive of the NCTJ said that community journalists will have access to a full training programme from the NCTJ while working.She said: \"Trainees without the NCTJ Diploma in Journalism will receive training to achieve the qualication, while those who have passed the diploma will work towards a new National Qualication in Journalism for community journalists.\"They will also have access to a range of training from Facebook focused on digital newsgathering skills.\"Read more: Two new national newspapers launched in ScotlandShe added: \"We are very proud to support the sustainability of quality local journalism by overseeing the recruitment of additional local news journalists from erse and inclusive backgrounds and by ensuring they are properly trained and qualied.\"Karyn Fleeting, head of audience at Reach PLC, said: \"Community news is shared widely on Facebook, on pages and in community groups, and this collaboration will help us reach communities which dont currently benefit from in-depth community news.\"We think it will be good for journalism, good for our newsrooms and good for the local communities we serve.\"Laura Adams, content director at Archant, added: \"We hope it can play a small part in boosting community engagement in towns, cities and counties across the UK, and open up new opportunities for the next generation of journalistic talent.\"The application process begins next year but the NCTJ and publishers will visit to schools, universities and industry events across the country to talk about the project, and encourage more young people to think about a career in journalism."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-mps-could-potentially-back-my-brexit-plan","story":"The First Minister said she believed the Commons could yet back remaining in the single market and customs union, despite many MPs regarding it as ldquoBrexit in name only.Ms Sturgeon also told the National Economic Forum in Dundee she feared Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit plan would leave Scotland at a ldquoreal competitive disadvantage to Northern Ireland.She said Ulsterrsquos tighter regulatory alignment with the EU -

are a blight on scenery and tourism as others hail them as a symbol of the countryrsquos progressive outlook on renewables.That argument is now set to intensy as moves are being made to almost double the size of turbines nearing the end of their lespans, according to a new report.The plans have also prompted environmental concerns as it would cause further disruption to Scotlandrsquos peatland - which most turbines are built on - damaging the soilrsquos vital carbon cutting resource.Mountaineering Scotland said the move would ldquoincrease the visual impacton Scotlandrsquos mountains and landscapes, and called for the ldquoenvironmental and aesthetic impact on the landscape to be made a ldquokey consideration.Environment Protection Scotland also said that the report, by researchers at the Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen, raises questions over the development of windfarm policy in Scotland.Charity spokesman John Bynorth said: ldquoScotlandrsquos peatlands have a powerful natural role to play in slowing climate change through carbon capture and everything must be done to prevent damage to this vital part of our eco-system.ldquoResearch by scientists has also found that even the lsquowakersquo from wind turbines can have an impact on air temperatures and humidity, impacting on the temperature of soil and on the surface of soil ndash so itrsquos clear that digging deeper or wider foundations in which to place bigger and more powerful windfarms will also potentially have a damaging impact on Scotlandrsquos environment.The report reveals that Scotland is home to more than , operational wind turbines, with a further , either under construction or awaiting planning permission.The majority of theseare on peatland.Renewable energy accounted for around % of the countryrsquos gross annual consumption in , up from just % in , with much of that increase attributed to onshore wind farms.The report revealed that as the turbines come to the end of their lespan, usually after around  years, they need to be upgraded or replaced via a process known as repowering.This means either disturbing the peat by regenerating existing turbine foundations or creating completely new foundations where on the site.The existing turbines would then be increased from  metres to roughly  metres to harness ldquobetter wind.Professor Susan Waldron, of the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, said that while the damage to peatland is serious, the ldquopayback time, i.e. the time it takes before the turbines become beneficial to the environment, is relatively short.Research suggests this is usually between two to three years, compared to the -year lespan of the turbine.Ms Waldron said the report wasof signicance internationally, and showed that Scotland is keen to lead the way in repowering, which has only been done on a small scale so far.ldquoWersquove completed the most comprehensive and collaborative report on repowering to date, she said, adding that it considers ldquothe ecological, hydrological, biogeochemical and carbon security impacts of the repowering process.ldquoThis shows that foundations could be re-engineered to take bigger turbines , but reusing the foundation generally requires more construction materials and disturbs the soil as much as a new foundation.She added that of the two repowering options,creating new foundations would be the most environmentally friendly as regeneration involved more materials and more disruption to the peat.Friends of the Earth Scotland said the report was a ldquohelpful contribution to the developing debate on repowering existing wind farms.Charity director Dr Richard Dixon said: ldquoScotland needs to develop our renewable energy capacitywe want to progress towards a zero carbon economy.ldquoThrough a process of engagement with stakeholders and expert analysis of the benefits arising, repowered sites can play a signicant role in the decades ahead.ldquoWith careful development on shallower peatland, the net emissions savings over the lespan of a turbine project can make a very large contribution to our collective climate action.Scottish

Downing Street suggested that the issue of whether or not fishing rights would be included in any transition extension was part of the ongoing negotiations.Extending the -month transition period as an alternative to the deeply isive issue of the backstop was raised by Theresa May at an EU summit last month. At the time the Prime Minister made clear this was not something she wanted to happen but,it did, it would only last a few months beyond December .Yet, because fishing quotas are set in December for the following  months, any transition extension that included fishing, would mean the UK not taking back full control of its fishing waters until December  at the earliest.However on Monday, Mrs May and Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, appeared more amenable to the option after Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, spoke about a possible extension to December .Mrs May told the CBIrsquos annual conference that any transition extension would have to end well before the next General Election due in June . But her remarks appeared to point to more than just a few months.Mr Clark noted how extending the transition would be beneficial to the business community, which did not want more than one change from the current position a backstop would involve two.The PMrsquos spokesman explainedboth sides were looking at a few weeks or months to complete the trade deal, then ldquothis is a decision to be taken around June  andhellipit will be at that point in time we would seek a short extension of the implementation period as opposed to going into the backstop.Askedthis was now the PMrsquos preferred option, he replied that it would ldquovery much depend on the facts at the time but stressed the key point was none of this was expected to happen as the PM believed the future relationship would be in place by January .Askedthe conditions of any extended transition period would be dferent from the planned transition ndash such as on fishing policy - the spokesman replied: ldquoThese are all things that would have to be discussed.Last week, the issue was raised in the Commons by Cornish Conservative MP Sheryll Murray to which the PM replied: ldquoWe have not changed our position, which is that, as of December , the UK should be an independent coastal state able to negotiate the issue of access to its waters for the following year and, obviously, for thereafter. MPs noted the word ldquoshould rather than will.Mr Mundell and his  fellow Scottish Conservative MPs have written to their party leader, threatening mutinyUK fishermen remain tied to the hated CFP beyond December .ldquoWe are leaving the CFP and becoming an independent coastal state in .

For while Labour grandee Peter Mandelson famously said that history would remember Mr Cameron ldquosimply as the prime minister who took us out of the EU, the legacy of another of the former member for Witneyrsquos bright ideas - austerity - shows just how unfit for office he really is.Dreamed up by Mr Cameron and fellow Bullingdon BoyGeorge Osborne - who, inexplicably, has reinvented himself as the Tory-bashing newspaper editor par excellence - austerity was announced in  as the antidote to the Labour Partyrsquos preceding ldquoage of irresponsibility. With the country brought low by unscrupulous bankers and misguided borrowers - not to mention profligate Labour politicians - the time had apparently come for us all to tighten our belts for the good of the nation.Yet while Mr Osbornersquos ldquowersquore all in this together mantra rang hollow right from the off, the extent to which austerity has ravaged the poor while allowing the rich to amble along just fine was last week laid bare in a damning report from the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. Indeed, thanks to austerity measures such as the introduction of what Mr Alston termed ldquoUniversal Discredit,  million people in the UK are now living in poverty, with the poor, women, racial and ethnic minorities, children, single parents, and people with disabilities most severely affected. Not only is this shameful in a nation that boasts the worldrsquos fth largest economy but, as Mr Alston said, it is ldquopatently unjust and contrary to British values.Nor can Scotland claim the moral high ground. Though the UN report noted that we have the lowest poverty rates of any UK nation, Scottish Government figures show that the number of people living in relative poverty north of the Border has increased by  per cent since the advent of austerity, from , in   to a million in  , , of whom are children. And while the Alston report praised measures such as the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fairer Scotland Action Plan and said its nascent benefits agency is ldquoguided by the principles of dignity and social security as a human right, the author stressed that accountability has not been written into the system while no mechanism is in place to ensure the most vulnerable can access what assistance is available to them.When he announced his age of austerity David Cameron said the intention was to show that ldquofiscal responsibility can go hand in hand with a social conscience. It is about as far from a ringing endorsement as you can get that Mr Alston has found the exact opposite to be the case, with his report highlighting that ldquoBritish compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach apparently designed to instil discipline where it is least useful, to impose a rigid order on the lives of those least capable of coping with todayrsquos world, and elevating the goal of enforcing blind compliance over a genuine concern to improve the wellbeing of those at the lowest levels of British society. Whether or not the policy has been ldquofiscally responsible, meanwhile, remains moot.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough, Warwick University economics professor Thiemo Fetzer published a paper earlier this year that drew a direct link between austerity and Brexit, with the deep cuts to welfare from  onwards thought to be responsible for pushing many in the UKrsquos most disadvantaged communities into the arms of UKIP and the vote-Leave camp. Sold on the promise of a new dawn of Great British prosperity, those voters - like the rest of us - are now forced to live in a country so economically damaged that the Financial Times reckons the average household is pound a year worse off than it was before the vote. What that figure will be once we make our final, shambolic exit from the European Union is anyonersquos guess, though we can all rest assured that it is highly unlikely to be heading south.Given his role in getting us into this mess, the idea that Mr Cameron is our best hope for getting out of it is far-fetched in the extreme. Whether he meant to or not, our former prime minister inflicted great misery on the UK the day he declared a new age of austerity, with his Brexit gamble only serving to compound the effect.The Tory Party under Theresa May may be intent on ripping itself ndash and the country ndash apart right now, but Mr Cameron is not the answer. Austerity and Brexit are indefensible allowing him to heap yet more misery on the people of the UK would be utterly unforgivable."},{"url":null,"title":"community gathers to remember mark","story":"Staff, parents and children of Logie Durno School gathered together on Friday afternoon to pay tribute to a local father.A remembrance event was held for Mark Mathers, who sadly died following an accident at his work on September .The green balloons were released by Marks family and friendsWhile taking part in the remembrance event, pupils wore ribbons that were green - Mark’s favourite colour.School pupils sang a number of songs at the event before Mark’s family released nine green biodegradable balloons.After the remembrance event was over, Mark’s we Deborah and sons Connor, Arron and Blair presented a cheque for £, to representatives of the Grampian Child Bereavement Network .Speaking to the Herald, Deborah said: “The money was raised at Mark’s funeral.The community gathered to watch the balloons float away“After we had the final total myself and Mark’s father thought about what charity we should donate it to.“We looked at ious charites but we thought it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the last couple of months and the staff at the school have been amazing.Commenting on the donation Jan Sanders of GCBN said: “For us it’s humbling that people going through something so sad like this choose to support us.“It’s an incredible amont to receive and it is a huge privilege to come here today.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Game of Thrones star Iain Glen may have recovered from deadly greyscale in the epic drama but hes asking his fellow Scots to own up to the inevitable and make a will. \"  \"  What do Iain Glen, Dame Judi Dench, Graham Norton and Robert Peston have in common  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“The money will be used to support other families to help them build hope for the future and to make them smile again.”Grampian Child Bereavement Network is a small charity that provides direct support to bereaved children and young people throughout the region."},{"url":null,"title":"academy hosts art exhibition","story":"Inverurie Academy held its second Art Exhibition on Thursday, November .The exhibition featured ious pieces of artwork by National , Higher and Advanced Higher pupils.Pupil Natalie Thomson with her work Pick  Mix TreatsHead of Creative Arts at Inverurie Academy, Olefine Richardson, said: “This year we have  National  exhibitors, ten Higher and one Advanced Higher.“The work on display is by our th, th and th year pupils.“This is the second year that we have held an art exhibition at the school and it is bigger than last year’s event.“The evening celebrates the pupils’ exceptional work and the phenomenal effort that they have put in to it.Many pupils created designs for new items including an apron, umbrella, and perfume boxes“We are really proud of them all and their hard work.”S Higher pupil Natalie Thomson had her work ‘ Pick  Mix Treats’ on display.Natalie said: “I chose Pick and Mix because it was fun to draw and I could eat it afterwards.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amPolice in Kirkwall are appealing for witnesses to an assault, which took place in the early hours of Sunday, to come forward.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Tuesday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

It’s not as bad a deal as characterised. It contains many positive elements in relation to the rights of EU citizens.“Going forward, it contains this hugely important prospect for Scottish businesses for being able to trade in the EU without tarfs, without quotas - that’s the number one thing that businesses have said that they want.”Read more: Jeremy Corbyn urged to meet Nicola Sturgeon and form united front for new Brexit voteFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said SNP MPs in Westminster will vote against the deal when it is put forward in the House of Commons.Mr Mundell suggested the reasons for doing so are linked to campaigning for a second Scottish independence referendum.He said: “That’s why Nicola Sturgeon is so keen on it, that’s why she’s mandating her MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit, because she understands that the chaos and disruption that a no-deal Brexit would bring would be the best recruiting base for her independence referendum.”SNP MSP Tom Arthur suggested Mr Mundell was refusing to put Scotland’s interests ahead of the interests of his party.He said: “David Mundell makes himself look and sound more ridiculous with every day that passes.“First he indicated he would resignNorthern Ireland was given special treatment, then he reportedly voiced concerns about the proposed deal while in Cabinet and now he has admitted Theresa May’s plan will leave Scotland worse off.“But still he clings to office, without a shred of principle or credibility.“It seems there is literally nothing that can happen that would lead David Mundell to put Scotland’s interests before the Tory party’s interests.“He is quite clearly the Cabinet’s man in Scotland rather than Scotland’s man in the Cabinet - and his position is now utterly untenable.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called Mr Mundell’s comments “unconvincing” and insisted there must be another vote on Brexit.He said: “The Scottish Secretary can’t bring himself to say the Prime Minister’s deal will make le better for people in Scotland and that’s because it won’t.“Tearing ourselves out of Europe will hit every single Scottish household.“People across the country watched the chaos of last week unfold and Conservative isions deepen.“Nobody is fooled by David Mundell’s unconvincing claim that this is the only way forward.“Those who favour a people’s vote now make up the biggest cohesive bloc in British politics.“Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding the chance to avoid a big Brexit blackhole.“Tory arrogance has taken us this far. People deserve better than to be marched into a terrible deal that will hurt their finances.“The Brexit decision needs to go back to the people.”Scottish Labour MP Lesley Laird said: “Theresa May once believed that no deal was better than a bad deal.“Now David Mundell is saying the exact opposite yet sees no conflict with his position in Cabinet.“To back this bad deal as the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit is to accept a  choice.“Instead of leadership from Theresa May’s government we are getting brinkmanship.“Parliament must be given a meaningful vote on the half-baked mess that Theresa May has brought back from Brussels and when, as appears likely, it is voted down, it is Parliament that must set out the next steps towards delivering a deal which delivers on the promises made to voters at the outset.”She added: “It was embarrassing to hear Mr Mundell unable to make any positive case for supporting Theresa May’s deal this morning.“It is clear the majority of his Scottish Tory colleagues are also unconvinced.“They should all now finally stand up for Scotland and reject this broken deal.“Scotland deserves better than Tory ministers and MPs who slavishly put party first and the people second.“Mr Mundell must resignhe is to retain even a scrap of credibility on this.”Read more: Lesley Riddoch: Now is the time for Nicola Sturgeon to reignite Scottish independence debate©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832071.1542649779!/image/image.jpg","title":"adopted children need help in school to have equal chance fiona aitken","story":"Earlier this year Adoption UK undertook a survey on well-being in schools, asking adoptive parents and their children to share their experiences of the education system. The responses painted a picture of a need for change and a lack of understanding of the needs of adopted children.Overwhelmingly, education has arisen as one of the main issues that adopted children are struggling with today.In Scotland,  per cent of parents feel their child’s experience of neglect or abuse in their early le has affected their schooling – and  per cent of parents feel that their children need more support.Adopted children were  per cent more likely to be excluded than their peers who had not experienced le in council care. Responses also showed that, of the adopted children who responded,  per cent had been teased or bullied because they were adopted, and that  per cent of parents felt that their children did not receive an equal chance in school.Our education system is grounded in the concept of GIRFEC – ‘Getting It Right For Every Child’. It is clear that we are not currently doing that for adopted and care-experienced children. In order to ‘get it right’, we must fully understand the needs of the children in our classrooms, and how best to respond to those needs.Adoption plays a crucial role for young people who are in the care system in Scotland. For children unable to remain with, orto, their birth family, adoption offers an opportunity for a permanent family and all that can offer a child. Adoption is a lelong process, but for families it begins with children who are at the heart of the process.The current and ongoing Independent Care Review, which is hoping to overhaul the existing care system in which the adoption process sits, has identied love as being one of the most crucial missing elements of the care system.In adoption, love is central to families. One phrase that prospective adopters may hear is that love is not enough, and any adoptive parent could tell you that loving their children will not automatically heal damage that may have occurred in their early lives.: Robert Swt: Thousands of kids are in care,  a year are adoptedAdoption is often considered to be a ‘happy ending’ for the children involved. This misconception means that the early experiences of children are not considered. It does not acknowledge the fact that more than  per cent of children who go on to be adopted have suffered abuse, neglect or trauma in their early lives.They are also living with the le-long impact of separation from their birth family, which is the unique factor that adopted children face within their group of care-experienced peers who may end up going in a dferent direction in the permanence system – adoption in the best-known form of permanence but this can also include long-term fostering and residential care.In addition to the emotional and attachment challenges faced, we are now increasingly aware of the growing number of care-experienced children who are living with the impact of drugs or alcohol while in utero. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is estimated to affect more than  per cent of children in care.It is the leading preventable cause of neurological dficulties and learning disabilities in the UK – and yet many professionals who work with children lack the knowledge and skills to adequately support them.In September this year, Adoption UK Scotland held a parliamentary event to raise awareness of our Equal Chance campaign, which is seeking a change in discourse about adopted children, and an acknowledgement of their needs in schools.: Dr Gary Clapton: Reunions after adoption can be complexThe highlight of this event was the voice of the young people themselves: five young people, from  to  years of age, spoke to a room full of professionals and policy-makers about their school experiences. They shared what worked, what didn’t – what had held them back and what had pushed them to achieve.Our Equal Chance campaign seeks and supports policy changes that will benefit our adopted young people. In Scottish schools, a child within the care system is automatically entitled to additional support and assessment of needs – the same child, who has the same history, and the same needs, loses this right as soon as the adoption order is passed.We want to support relevant government policies designed to raise attainment and emotional well-being for adopted children in school – we know that there are policies in place to better support all children, and we want to ensure that both schools and families are aware of where adopted children fit within these policies, and how they can be implemented to improve experiences for children and families. Recently the Scottish Government announced that they were giving an additional £ million pounds to local authorities to increase the remit of the Pupil Equity Fund to include care experienced children. Adopted children fit within this category, and it is crucial that parents and schools are aware of this to access the support that children are entitled to.At our event, the Minister of Children and Young People, Maree Todd MSP, commented that: “Earlier this year the Deputy First Minister announced an additional £ million over the le of this Parliament to supplement the opportunities for care experienced young people available through the Scottish Attainment Challenge. Local authorities, as Corporate Parents, should identy the ways in which the funding could be best used to improve attainment of their care experienced children and young people, including those that have been adopted.”For some children an equal chance means not necessarily being treated the same as their peers – but being offered the extra support and input that they require. The experience of adopted young people in Scotland is that they are not being given an equal chance. They have already experienced adversity and disadvantages in le, school should be the opportunity for them to reach their full potential. Not all children have an equal start in le. But we can give them an equal chance in school.Fiona Aitken is director of Adoption UK Scotland.

Scotland has been sidelined.”Andrew Marr replied: “So why don’t you have a second referendum ” Nicola Sturgeon responded: “You will have to wait for that statement – that will not be in the too distant future.”: Nicola Sturgeon: decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’So far, so unremarkable. The SNP leader’s been producing that “wait and see” line since last year’s snap general election. Even though it failed to convince when trotted out in response to Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens during First Ministers Questions last week when he pointed out that waiting for clarity over Brexit might mean waiting forever. Now maybe it’s no bad thing to have folk urging you to move a bit faster towards your constitutional destination of choice. But maybe it’s also a little weird.: Richard Leonard: Scottish independence vote would be worse than BrexitCommentators north and south of the Border assume the Scottish Government must be close to some kind of announcement on a second indyref, given the degree to which Scotland has been visibly carved out of the Brexit process, denied any whf of the dferential deals that proved possible for Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and Cyprus despite Scots voting more overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. But Nicola Sturgeon and Mike Russell spent the weekend promoting another cause – urging the UK to remain in the Customs Union and stay in the Single Market like Norway and Iceland. Now of course it’s a reasonable enough suggestion. Norway joined the halfway house after two referenda rejected EU membership so they could keep their recently-won political independence but win single market access for their outward facing economy. Access to the single market is not a great solution but it’s a heck of a lot more popular in Norway than full EU membershipor leaving the single market to plough the lonely free trade furrow advocated by Britain’s hard Brexiteers. But there are cultural reasons why single market access can work for Norway but not for Britain. Firstly, the arrangement means being a “rule-taker.” That may be easier for a small country that was never a full EU member in the first place than once “mighty” Britain where the very idea of “rule-taking” prompts overwrought talk about “vassal states”. Secondly, the acceptance of less-than-perfect deals is an everyday occurrence in Norway because it’s had proportional representation since  and thus daily experience of negotiation and compromise. Westminster’s first-past-the-post system, by contrast, breeds a confrontational “no surrender” approach to international relations which would make Britain a very bad fit with the small, consensual EEA nations. Thirdly, membership of the single market means accepting freedom of movement. This doesn’t particularly bother the Norwegians, who were part of a Nordic Travel Area  years before Schengen and joined that club despite remaining outside the EU to make le and travel easier for citizens and neighbours. Sadly though, freedom of movement is a massively big deal for the millions of Britons who voted to leave the EU. So while single market membership may make sense on paper, there’s absolutely no way the closet Brexiteer Jeremy Corbyn or the Ukip-fearing Theresa Maywill ever consider single market membership because it ends the illusion that control over British borders can ever be “taken back”. So, since neither the Tories nor Labour will ever accept this halfway house, why are the SNP still pushing it  Are they virtue signalling – demonstrating that the Scottish Government can embrace a rational solution to Britain’s Brexit problems evenit cannot be stomached by No   If so, why bother It’s hard to see how much more virtue the Scottish Government can possibly accumulate over Brexit. Scottish voters not living on another planet since  are fully aware that we voted to remain, the Scottish Government published an options document a full year before Westminster, political parties here are fairly relaxed about freedom of movement and even Ruth Davidson could support single market access as long as no one from London was watching. Butthis virtuous solution has no hope of being implemented, why does the SNP spend its only moment of UK-wide media continuing to advocate solutions for the whole of the UK when that makes it almost impossible to start making the case for independence As Britain’s constitutional crisis likely deepens this week, every other party will be laying out its stall – whether that is A Peoples’ Vote, A No Deal Brexit, Theresa May’s deal, a Tory leadership challenge or a general election. But Scottish independence is nowhere to be seen. Of course, everyone accepts that naming the date for another referendum is indeed impossible with uncertainty all around. But it seems that worry about naming a date is also stopping Nicola Sturgeon from making a case – and that’s becoming problematic. Scottish voters are being plunged into a Black Friday-style sale of constitutional options and voters are thinking deeply about the future . Does the SNP believe swithering Scots will hold onto their democratic currency, ignore all the whizzy offers being laid before them and keep their powder dry till the Indy Express finally rolls into town  If it takes too long, swithering voters may have ed to the Union fold.So it’s just as well the Greens have decided to move into the unoccupied political space of the Independence movement. Yesterday, Scottish Greens co-convener Maggie Chapman wrote about the need to get updated, Brexit-framed, modern arguments for independence into the public domain as a matter of urgency. SNP MP Mhairi Black made similar points.Many Yes activists are praying the SNP leadership has got over the snap election and will start talking in detail about the independence scenario it exists to promote. If Oscar Wilde is right and the only thing worse than being talked about is indeed not being talked about, then Westminster is actually winning as an institution by being the sole focus of attention right now. Playing it safe can be laudable – but not being a player at a time like this is not an option.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832114.1542656676!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence if uk didn t exist we d invent it pamela nash","story":"Unionists will take heart from new Survation poll, but Brexit still poses a threat, writes Pamela Nash, chief executive of the Scotland in Union campaign group.As soon as the EU referendum result was announced, Nicola Sturgeon predictably used it to revive her campaign for Scotland to leave the UK.Nationalists have not stopped campaigning since, using every twist and turn in the Brexit saga in a desperate attempt to boost support for the break-up of Britain.The SNP has no interest in getting a good Brexit deal or even stopping Brexit – it wants chaos in the hope that Remain voters will swing behind independence in the belief that Scotland could easily stay in the EU. It’s a cynical tactic that EU Remain voters must always remember: don’t let Nicola Sturgeon use your vote to break up the UK.The new poll from Survation, published in The Scotsman today, shows that Ms Sturgeon’s strategy is backfiring.If a contest was held tomorrow,  per cent of people in Scotland would vote to remain in the UK. In fact,  per cent of former Yes voters would now vote for Scotland to remain in the UK.This matches up with evidence that we hear first-hand at campaign events throughout the country.Contrary to SNP spin, there are many voters who backed the Yes campaign in  who no longer support independence.There are several reasons for their change of heart – not least the recent experience of the oil price crash, which would have exposed an independent Scotland to economic catastrophe and proved that Alex Salmond’s White Paper was a work of fiction.But Brexit – whether you support it or not – has demonstrated the intense complexities of leaving a political union.It has proved dficult – and it remains to be seenimpossible – to secure a orce deal with the EU, which in historical terms is a relatively new organisation. Just imagine what it would be like disentangling us from a -year-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.: Nicola Sturgeon: Decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’Alex Salmond’s White Paper fancully claimed a orce deal could be in place within  months. The SNP can never again peddle that lie.But more than anything, what we are hearing time and time again is that Brexit has brought home to voters just how precious being part of the UK is. The chaos of the Brexit negotiations highlights the stability and security we enjoy as part of the UK. Few voters want to be out of both the EU and the UK.If in today’s world the UK did not exist, we would need to invent it.So, it comes as little surprise thata second independence referendum was called after we leave the EU, this poll shows that voters would still choose to remain in the UK – with or without a Brexit deal in place.The wording in the poll was chosen deliberately. In , we were offered a yes no option and the no campaign won by around , votes. Ms Sturgeon insisted it was a “once-in-a-generation” referendum.But she used the  EU referendum to revive her campaign – a contest in which the Electoral Commission advised that voters should be offered a remain leave option.The independent experts came to the conclusion that a yes no option question is not the best option as it cannot be considered neutral when reflecting only one outcome in the question.Let’s be clear, there should not be a second independence referendum – it is not wanted and would damage Scotland – butthere was one, the precedent of using a remain leave question with both options in the question has now clearly been set. The Yes campaign will have to become the Leave campaign.: ‘Scottish independence case stronger after Scotland sidelined in Brexit talks’But while the poll makes for encouraging reading, those of us who believe in the UK must not be complacent.Just over a third of voters said Brexit makes them more likely to support Scotland leaving the UK. And while pro-UK parties have  per cent of support in Westminster voting intentions, it is still of concern that the SNP remains the largest single party.In recent weeks, senior Nationalist figures have floated the idea that a majority of Scottish MPs at the next election would be a mandate for independence.It’s reckless and dangerous talk, but it hasn’t been dismissed by the SNP leadership.SNP strategists know they are failing to turn most Scots towards independence, so are exploring other ways to break up the UK. Their underhand tactics cannot go unchecked.That’s why Scotland in Union will be campaigning hard in the weeks ahead to remind voters that whatever your views on Brexit, independence is not the answer.A separate Scotland would not automatically be in the EU and would face a long and painful application process, with absolutely no guarantee of entry.Like any club, there are rules which apply to new members.EU member states are expected to have a budget deficit of no more than three per cent of GDP.The latest official figures put Scotland’s deficit at a whopping . per cent – four times higher than the UK. The only way to get that down is by both hiking taxes and slashing spending on already-stretched public services such as schools and hospitals – meaning deeper, harmful austerity.All member countries must also commit to eventual membership of the euro, making any suggestion of financial independence nonsense as monetary policy would be handed to Frankfurt.Why harm our economy by leaving the UK – which is worth four times as much as our trade with the EU By remaining in the UK, families are better off by the equivalent of £,.It simply makes no sense to walk away from our oldest friends, neighbours, trading partners and allies.That’s why the majority of people in Scotland still want to remain in the United Kingdom.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4827978.1542664857!/image/image.jpg","title":"john curtice should we stay or should we go poll reveals many indy voters happy to be part of uk","story":"What we seemingly learn from this poll is there is a body of people who would like Scotland to be independent, but who would be quite happythat could be consistent with Scotland remaining part of the UK.Even during the independence referendum, it often appeared the question that Scotland was asking itself was not just whether it wanted to be independent. Most people want Scotland to be politically independent, with a strong parliament of its own. Rather, the key question is whether or not it wishes to go so far as leaving the UK.We should not be surprisedthere are some people who would like Scotland to be independent, but as part of the UK – and that when we ask a dferent poll question that focuses on Scotland being in or out of the UK rather than on it becoming independent, some people give a dferent answer.Does this mean that a dferent question should be asked in any second independence referendum  It might be argued the meaning of ‘leave the UK’ in the poll is not clear enough. If we follow the precedent established in , setting the referendum question would be a decision for the Scottish Government rather than the UK government. The obvious thing for the Scottish Government to do would be to ask the exact same question as in , which was tested and approved by the Electoral Commission.The poll includes several questions about what sort of impact Brexit might have on support for independence. As has been found before,you ask people such hypothetical questions, then by the time you ask them about leaving with no deal, you get very substantial movement towards independence. In this case, what was originally a - split in favour of remaining in the UK becomes just -.But beware of hypothetical questions. They invite people to focus on a particular element and in many respects they often tell you more about what people think of the condition they are being asked to take into account rather than their view of what the question is supposed to be about.Presented with such a question, people who do not like leaving the EU will say ‘of course that means we should get out of the UK’. But whether they would actually vote that way is another matter. We should remember there were lots of poll questions before the February  European Council summit to which people responded thatDavid Cameron came back with a piece of paper and said ‘it’s all fine, I’ve got a deal,’ they would vote Remain. But the polls did not move at all when he did come back with his deal. On its own it is far from clear that leaving the EU will necessarily result in increased support for independence. What is more likely to matter is whether or not the economy goes pear-shaped as a result.In the much milder question in the poll on whether the prospect of Brexit makes you more or less likely to vote for independence, the  per cent of No voters say they are more likely to do so are almost counterbalanced by  per cent of Yes voters who say they are less likely. These numbers suggest the impact of Brexit could be relatively small.Indeed, previous polling has shown while some people who voted No in  and Remain in  have switched to Yes, they have been counterbalanced by a similar number of people who voted Yes and Leave who would now vote No.It is thus somewhat surprising that, in the poll, people were more likely to say that Brexit was the more important issue than they were to state that independence was the bigger question. However, this may reflect the fact Brexit is what everybody is talking about at the moment while independence is not in the news.In truth, most Leave voters are unlikely to swing behind independencethere is no Brexit deal. They think that leaving without a deal would be fine anyway. The group that it might help sway are some Remain voters, most of whom strongly dislike leaving without a deal.However, we probably will not know before March whether such an outcome is going to happen. A government defeat on the meaningful vote will not automatically trigger no deal. If the government has not negotiated a successful deal by  January, it has to come to the House of Commons and say what it is going to do – and most MPs are opposed to no deal.In the meantime, this poll suggests in an early general election Labour could lose five of its seven seats in Scotland.

The call for unity came as Mr Corbyn faced criticism for again appearing to play down the prospects of a referendum on the terms of Brexit, claiming it was “not an option for today” and refusing to say how he would cast his ballot in a so-called “people’s vote”. Ms Sturgeon described Mrs May’s draft agreement as a “blindfold Brexit” that lacked clarity on the UK’s future relationship with the EU and confirmed SNP MPs would vote against it in the Commons.“If the House of Commons says we want to go down the road of single market and customs union membership, we want more time to take this back to the people of the UK in another vote, we need an extension of Article  –there is a clear change of direction – then I believe the EU  would be prepared to look at that,” the First Minister said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.“But that means those who don’t want this deal coming together.“Those who don’t think the Prime Minister’s deal is the right way to go have now a responsibility to come together and coalesce around an alternative.“I will seek to have discussions this week with other parties to get us into that position.”The First Minister said she was keen to talk to Mr Corbyn “and whoever ” in the Commons when she visits London.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said the SNP and Labour leaders should meet. “We need to build a broad front on the way forward, which I hope would be a people’s vote,” he said. Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler said: “Support is growing for a people’s vote, and there is an opportunity for Labour to get fully behind this and campaign to stop a reckless and damaging Brexit.“This is a time for strong leadership in the interests of the workers who our party represents.“I encourage Jeremy to engage with other party leaders, including Nicola Sturgeon, to address the Brexit crisis.”East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield said: “For Theresa May to understand that all of the parties that are in opposition are as one on this is useful for her to know.“There is an opportunity there for people to talk… that’s what needs to happen. The time has come to say that [a people’s vote] is what the majority of the country want.”He added: “If ever there was a time for people to start talking, now is it.”Last week Mr Corbyn raised hopes that opposition parties would present a united front when he joined Ms Sturgeon in signing a letter demanding MPs be able to amend the motion that puts the Brexit deal to a Commons vote.However, despite party policy stating that Labour will pursue a second EU referendumattempts to change the deal or force a general election fail, Mr Corbyn poured cold water on calls for Labour to support a people’s vote, saying it was “an option for the future” but “not an option for today”.In an interview with Sky’s Ridge On Sunday, he also told how his party couldn’t stop Brexit “because we don’t have the votes in Parliament to do so.“There was a referendum in , a majority voted to leave the EU, there are many reasons why people voted. “I don’t think you call a referendum and then say you don’t like the result and go away from it. You’ve got to understand why people voted and negotiate the best deal you can.” Asked about calls for a second referendum, Mr Corbyn said: “It’s an option for the future but it’s not an option for today,there was a referendum tomorrow what’s it going to be on, what’s the question going to be ”Asked which way he would vote in such a referendum, he said: “I don’t know how I am going to vote, what the options would be at that time.”The Labour leader will appeal to business to back his plan for a Brexit deal in a speech to the CBI conference in London today.Arguing that Labour can secure a deal with closer ties to the EU market and better protections for workers’ rights, Mr Corbyn will say: “The government is trying to force a bad deal that doesn’t meet our country’s needs by threatening us all with the chaos and serious damage to our economy of a no-deal outcome.“The Prime Minister knows that no-deal isn’t a real option. Neither the Cabinet nor Parliament would endorse such an extreme and dangerous course.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832162.1542700411!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 60 of scots would back remain in new scottish independence vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots would vote against independence by a wide marginthey were asked whether to leave or remain in the United Kingdom, a landmark poll has found.The poll’s release comes as Nicola Sturgeon and Theresa May are set for showdown talks, with the UK speeding towards an uncertain Brexit conclusion.The First Minister will meet opposition leaders at Westminster today in a bid to build a united front against the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal, promising a tense encounter with the Prime Minister in Downing Street.However, the meeting depends on other political forces, with the threat of a possible vote of no-confidence by her own MPs continuing to hang over Mrs May.: No-deal Brexit ‘catastrophic’ for Scotland, says David MundellMs Sturgeon said last night: “Brexit must not be a  choice between the deal the Prime Minister has presented and the no-deal outcome which even members of her own Cabinet now say would be disastrous.”The Survation poll, commissioned by a pro-Union group, found thata referendum were held now,  per cent of Scottish voters aged  and over would choose to stay in the UK and just  per cent would choose to leave, once the don’t knows are removed.: Fight to defeat Theresa May’s Brexit deal a national ‘emergency’, SNP saysAmong voters aged  and over the margin is even wider, with  per cent voting to remain in the UK and just  per cent choosing to leave, again once don’t knows are removed.The findings represent one of the highest levels of support for staying in the UK of any poll conducted since the  referendum.However, polls suggest Brexit could boost support for independence, particularlythere is a chaotic exit from the EU.The margin in favour of staying in the UK narrows to -the UK leaves the EU with a deal and is just -the country leaves without a deal. A total of  per cent of respondents said UK membership of the EU was more important than Scotland remaining part of the UK, compared to  per cent who put the UK first and  per cent who said the two Unions were equally important.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, the campaign group that commissioned the poll, said: “This bombshell poll shows that a huge majority of Scots want to remain in the UK and are turned off by Nicola Sturgeon’s desperate attempts to use Brexit to break up Britain. Voters know that we are better off as part of the UK and it makes sense to remain with our oldest friends, neighbours and allies rather than ide us in the name of nationalism.“The Nationalists will stop at nothing until Scotland is separated from the UK. That’s why they are weaponising Brexit in the hope of boosting support for independence.“But our trade with the rest of the UK is worth four times our trade with the EU. Why put our economy and jobs at risk ”Ms Nash added: “This poll reveals how the SNP’s tactics have backfired and shows that people in Scotland would vote to remain in the UK with or without a Brexit deal in place.“However, we know the Nationalists won’t stop campaigning, so we need to continue campaigning as well to ensure the voices of the majority of Scots are heard.“Whatever your views on Brexit, independence is not the answer.”The SNP said the findings made clear that Brexit was forcing Scots to reconsider their place in the UK. “It’s clear that Brexit is drawing more and more people towards the opportunities of independence as Scotland’s interests continue to be sidelined by Westminster,” SNP depute leader Keith Brown said.“And a majority are confident that an independent Scotland could take its place at Europe’s top table.“With crucial days ahead as we hurtle towards Brexit, the SNP will continue to stand up to the Tories and fight for what’s best for Scotland’s future.”As the Scottish Government prepares to restart the campaign for independence in earnest once the Brexit deal is settled, the findings will spark a debate about what question voters should be asked in any new referendum on Scotland’s constitutional future.Polling agency Survation used a wording based on the  EU referendum, asking people how they would vote in response to the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”In , the Edinburgh Agreement between the Scottish and UK governments that set the terms for the independence referendum gave Holyrood control over the franchise and referendum question, on the understanding that voters would be presented with a single question.David Cameron, the then-prime minister, is widely believed to have feared a two-question referendum preferred by Alex Salmond, asking voters whether they supported “devolution max” with sweeping new powers for the Scottish Parliament.The existing UK government has said it would not grant permission under the Scotland Act for a new independence referendum.Mrs May insists that voters made their choice in  and, while the Brexit process is ongoing, “now is not the time” for more constitutional upheaval. However, last week the First Minister said she would unveil plans for a new push towards independence “in the not-too-distant future”.Polling expert John Curtice said the results showed most Scots want “the best of both worlds”, with greater political autonomy while remaining in the UK. The Survation poll also confirmed the SNP’s continued strength, with voters set to send more Nationalist MPs to Westminster in the event of a snap election.Support for the SNP is at  per cent, up  per cent from the  general election. The two main Unionist parties would lose ground compared with the last election, with the Conservatives on  per cent, down  per cent, and Labour on  per cent, down  per cent. The Liberal Democrats would pick up one point, putting them on  per cent.Analysis by Mr Curtice suggests that result would give the SNP  MPs at Westminster, picking up five seats from Labour and two from the Conservatives. The Lib Dems would remain on four MPs. Mr Brown said: “People are continuing to put their trust in the SNP to stand up for Scotland.“We command a -point lead over the Tories, who are consumed by the complete and utter chaos of Brexit.“And Labour aren’t seen as a credible alternative. That’s why they’re languishing even further.“It seems this poll was commissioned by our opponents to land a political blow on the SNP, whereas it’s had the exact opposite effect. These figures make extremely encouraging reading for the independence movement while leaving the Tory and Labour parties extremely downhearted.”Survation questioned , people online between - November.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure!

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Tuesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

Speaking to second the motion, DUP Councillor Paul Reid said: The poppy is an emblem of remembrance used since .The poppy is not a political symbol, it is not a religions symbol but a reminder of those who fought for freedom.TUV Councillor Brian Collins thanked Cllrs Henry and Reid for bringing this matter to the attention of Mid and East Antrim Council.He said: This is a very emotive subject.To Cambridge Universitys Student Union, shame on you. Many a young man and women left the university and interrupted their studies to go a serve their nation, and many of them never ed to their studies.We have to remember the families. This is just disgraceful.The TUV fully support this important motion.UUP Councillor AP Wilson also supported the motion.He said: We share the disappointment with Cambridge Universitys student union.Cllr Wilson, however said he didnt think Council should get involved in: undergraduate student union politics, saying that: Sometimes there are lots of brains and not necessarily much common sense.He said that Council should do all they can to make sure remembrance was respectful and not party political.Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair was also concerned about getting involved in student politics.He said: We should reaffirm our support for Remembrance Sunday.After a recorded vote, Sinn Fein Councillors Hardy and McKeown voted against the motion while Councillor Paul Maguire, Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair and SDLP Councillor Declan OLoan abstained from voting. Every other resent councillor voted for the motion, therefore it was carried.Speaking afterwards, DUP Councillor Beth Clyde said: I think it is a disgrace that people wont support the memory of all that have fallen.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

Looking after the maintenance of it, the operations of it, all the visitors’ services, and the staff and all that side of things.“Anything that happens on the bridge is my responsibility and it’s my job to make sure it gets sorted out.”Trish Johnson making safety checks on the bridge.Born in Belfast, Trish grew up in Banbridge, attended St Mary’s Primary School and then Banbridge Academy where she completed her A Levels before going on to study engineering at the University of Salford, Manchester.After graduating, she says she “sort of fell into” bridge engineering and maintenance – an industry she has remained in for more than  years.Trish, who is better known to family and friends in Northern Ireland as Patricia, has been bridgemaster at Clton for the past two years. But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now. and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"   and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"  Christmas switch-on and twilight market tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October ."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

Theyre wrong about the draft agreement,\" she said. \"Its not perfect, but it is certainly a baseline to protect our economic interests and agreements.\"Its now very clear right across Ireland, north and south, that the key voices from business, agriculture and other sectors are coming out and facing down the very negative politics advanced by the DUP and Tory Brexiteers.\"Issuing a direct message to Mrs Foster, Ms McDonald said: \"Anyone who wishes to protect Ireland, north and south, needs to get off their Brexiteer high horse, face reality and understand that the current agreement is what Brexit looks like. If I were Arlene Foster I would wake up and smell the coffee, reassess my position and insist that the internal party wranglings within the DUP and Tory party cannot be allowed to drive any part of Ireland over the clf.\"Ms McDonald continued: \"Brexit isnt a passing phenomenon - this is for keeps - and we are still in very dangerous and choppy waters. \"All of us, irrespective of our party political persuasion, have to behave like adults. This is grown-up politics and its about protecting peoples livelihoods and jobs and the entire island of Ireland. \"So rather than adopting the reckless strategy that they have, the DUP now needs to listen to wider society and come on board with the rest of us who are absolutely determined to protect Ireland and Irish people, north and south. \"Now is the time for cool heads to ensure that the bottom lines around no hard border, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and crucially the protection of citizens rights are met. \"This is vital to protect everybody who lives and works on the island of Ireland,\" she added."},{"url":null,"title":"debtridden northern ireland schools need bengoastyle review mla","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Their joint interpretation captured the essence of yet another Mozart masterpiece, with the soloist giving a most sensitive performance of the blissful Adagio, which is one of those classical pieces most people recognize, but are sometimes not sure where it comes from.The second half was taken up by Schuberts Ninth Symphony, known as \"The Great\", which the Ulster Orchestra already performed this year at the end of its lunchtime series in early summer.Under the direction of Rustioni, this was a stately and measured performance of this truly \"great\" symphony, which finally burst into le in the finale.Schubert was never a composer to waste a good tune and he repeated the main theme all the way to its triumphant climax, to sustained and deserved applause.The Ulster Orchestra is looking for a new principal conductor, and Maestro Rustioni, on his third visit to Belfast, has certainly made his mark."},{"url":null,"title":"we would be trapped taoiseach comments show hard border never possible says arlene foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Fosters comments come amid growing pressure on the party from Northern Irelands business community to rethink its position on the proposed deal. On Friday influential farming and business organisations voiced their support for it. Appearing on RTEs The Week in Politics programme on Sunday, Mr Varadkar said his government was not contemplating a hard border on the island of Ireland in the event of a rejection of the draft Brexit withdrawal deal. \"We have been told that the backstop is only necessary to prevent such a hard border, but these comments make it clear that the EU’s insistence on a backstop was not aimed at this,\" said Mrs Foster.

We would be trapped,\" she added. \"Those attempting to sell the current deal are using the threat of no deal as the only other option. I appreciate the concerns people have about a no deal but this should not be a binary choice. It is absolutely clear that it is time to work for a better deal.”On Friday, Mr Varadkar warned against unpicking the current withdrawal deal and said signing up to the agreement was the only way of avoiding a hard border. In Belfast on Monday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley was speaking to business leaders in the province about the benefits of the proposed deal. Mrs Bradley said a no-deal Brexit would mean theof customs and regulatory checks on the island of Ireland with World Trade Organisation rules meaning it was \"very clear\" checks would be required. She also suggested the future of the Common Travel Area would become uncertain in the event of a no-deal Brexit. On Monday Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald hit out at Arlene Foster over her partys position on the current Brexit deal. Mary Lou McDonald insisted it was time for “grown-up politics” and to act to protect the island of Ireland’s economy from a no-deal Brexit.In a scathing assessment of the DUP position, Ms McDonald said “internal wrangles” within the party should not be allowed to drive Ireland “over the clf”."},{"url":null,"title":"which reveals 87 of black friday bargains were cheaper earlier","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A team led by Patricia Yang of the Georgia Institute of Technology found that wombats can take about two weeks to digest its food, meaning faeces becomes dry and solid before it is passed. Yes, that’s what you think it is..... you think it’s #wombatpoo that is! From our own extensive collection of animal poos... pic exprNpxAX— National Poo MuseumNovember , By inflating intestines with a long balloon, the researchers found that the wombats’ intestinal walls stretch unevenly, allowing for the formation of the cube shapes.They explained that as faeces move into the final % of the intestine, it changes from a liquid-like state into solid matter. At that stage, the dung takes on the shape of separated cubes measuring about two centimetres.The team of scientists said the findings could prove useful in areas beyond the natural world, explaining the study’s use in developing new manufacturing techniques.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The study said: “In the built world, cubic structures are created by extrusion or injection moulding, but there are few examples of this feat in nature. “This study addresses the long-standing mystery of cubic scat formation and provides insight into new manufacturing techniques for non-axisymmetric structures using soft tissues.”The team presented their findings at the st Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Atlanta."},{"url":null,"title":"this is why worldtoiletday is trending around the world","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The rationale for the chosen route has been explained in the Stage  Preferred Route Corridor Selection Report which will be available at both events as well as online from  November.”Ronan Gallagher, Communications Manager for the project, added: “One of our key objectives is to build infrastructure that will encourage people to cycle and walk to and from their destination in Derry or Muff, but particularly between the two locations. Once completed, not only will we link Muff to Derry, but students at Thornhill College and several primary schools will be able to cycle and walk to school in a safe, segregated environment.”At both events the general public will have an opportunity to leave comments on the proposals. For those who are unable to attend, plans and a comments card will be available at www.nwgreenway. After these events, both local authorities will proceed to lodge formal planning permissions in both jurisdictions and will engage with landowners along the route to agree accommodation works.

happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these customers, I believe they have a particular duty of care to our elderly neighbours. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions.

A number of focused engagements with industry specialists, FDI executives and venture capitalists took place throughout the week in both Philadelphia and Boston as part of the Trade and Investment mission led jointly by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, presenting the compelling investment proposition that the Northwest City Region has to offer.Potential investors heard from leading global company DuPont, which has a longstanding commitment to the region, taking advantage of the unique combination of benefits that the Northwest region has to offer including an accessible, connected and business friendly gateway region with a compelling vision for greater international impact.Investors learned that companies and businesses are attracted by a talented and educated workforce, the value balance, the superb quality of le and the supportive business environment. Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Cllr Seamus ODomhnaill, who led the delegation along with Cllr John Boyle Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, believes that these types of engagements are essentialwe are to raise the profile of the region as an investment location. “Having these key influencers and potential investors in a room focusing on the northwest region and sharing with them our vision and ambition as well as the practical supports and assistance available to businesses in the region is vital,” he stressed. “There is no better way to build meaningful connections and relationships than face to face engagements.”Mayor John Boyle believes that: “The strength of the region is underpinned by the strong collaborative approach which sees industry, government at both central and local level, and further and higher education institutions from both sides of the border working together to fuel further economic growth and prosperity. This is something that investors value greatly in terms of facilitating ease of access to supports in the region.” Local businesses from a range of sectors across both Council areas also participated in the mission meeting with potential clients and business partners with a view to increasing sales and expanding their businesses. Derry based Bridie Mullin Irish Linen Ltd. participated in the mission and brought her eponymous label of handcrafted quality Irish line to Boston in an effort to tap into the US market.Bridie explains that the trade visit was an opportunity to build on her own research, and to visit stores and meet with potential clients gaining a deeper understanding of what exactly the customer is looking for.

This project is being led by Assistant Professor Gareth Doherty in Hard GSD, who is originally from Donegal. Reaching out to the diaspora was also a key objective of the mission and this manested in events in both Philadelphia and Boston, where members of the diaspora from across the region attended and shared with the delegation the opportunities and challenges faced by the diaspora and their commitment to continue to engage in a way that is meaningful and mutually beneficial.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and donrsquot have to climb up to get them.Cararsquos infectious personality shone through in the programme as did her determinism to try out everything despite her stature.Her love of sweets are shown in the denrsquos decor which has Gummy Bear windows, a roof made of strawberry laces, a Coca-Cola-shaped door, a lolly-pop-themed dance floor so Cara can show off her moves and several sweet dispensers that are positioned at reaching height for her.One of the highlights is a height-adjustable desk that Cara can change to suit as she gets older.Cara lives with her mum Trish, a P teacher at Cedar Tree Integrated School in Crossgar, dad Sean and two year-old brother Noah.She shares the same condition with her mum and Noah.Mrs Mailey is delighted that Cara has this special space to play in.ldquoI had never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday. They were the nicest team and Cara was their number one priority throughout it all.ldquoAppearing in this programme has given Cara a lot of confidence.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges.

deliver best of both worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Brexit, of course. I’ve had my fill. Editorial ImageMy brain is tired trying to understand all its nuances. But worse than that, it is distracting me from what is the most important time of the year – Christmas. I have always loved the run-down to Christmas. It’s a time when we begin to think of others, and shop for the loved ones around us. But Brexit has come between me and the festive season making me feel ill towards anyone raising the subject when all I want to be bothered about is what size the turkey should be this year. Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser.

People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.
