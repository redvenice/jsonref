Three of these Marine cinematographers were killed in action.Even before the battle began, Marine Corps leaders knew they wanted a comprehensive visual account of the battle.          More than 6,800 Americans were killed on ships and landing craft aiding in the attack more than 19,200 were wounded         More than 50 Marine combat cameramen operated across the eight square miles of Iwo Jima during the battleBeyond a historical record, combat photography from Iwo Jima would assist in planning and training for the invasion of the Japanese main islands. Some Marine cameramen were assigned to the front lines of inidual units, and others to specific activities, like engineering and medical operations.Most of the cameramen on Iwo Jima used 100-foot film reels that could capture about two and a half minutes of film. Sgt. Genaust, who shot the color sequence atop Suribachi, shot at least 25 reels – just over an hour of film – before he was killed, roughly halfway through the campaign.Other cameramen who survived the entire battle produced significantly more. Sgt. Francis Cockrell was assigned to document the work of the 5th Division\u0027s medical activities. Shooting at least 89 reels, he probably produced almost four hours of film.Sgt. Louis L. Louft fought with the 13th Marines, an artillery regiment his more than 100 film reels likely resulted in more than four hours of content.Landing on the beach with engineers of the 4th Division on Feb. 25, 1945, Pfc. Angelo S. Abramo compiled over three hours of material in the month of fighting he witnessed.         At least 26 combat cameramen shot motion pictures while the rest shot still images. Three of the Marine cinematographers were killed in action         More than 50 Marine combat cameramen operated across the eight square miles of Iwo Jima during the battleEven taking a conservative average of an hour of film from each of the 26 combat cameramen, that suggests there was at least 24 hours of unique film from the battle. Many surviving elements of this record are now part of the film library of the Marine Corps History Division, which we\u0027re working with. The remainder are cataloged by the National Archives and Records Administration.While military historians visiting the History Division in the past have used this large library, the bulk of its films have not been readily available to the public, something that mass digitization is finally making possible.For many decades, the visual records made by Marines have been seen by the public only piecemeal, often with selected portions used as mere stock footage in films, documentaries and news programs, chosen because a shot has action, not because of the historical context of the imagery.Even when they are used responsibly by documentary filmmakers, the editing and selection of scenes imposes the filmmaker\u0027s interpretation on the images. Wilsbacher said: \u0027As a historian and archivist, though, I believe it is important for people to directly engage with historical sources of all types, including the films from Iwo Jima.\u0027After the battle, the Americans buried their dead in temporary cemeteries, awaiting transportation back to the U.S. The film segment just before the graveside scene shows a service honoring the Americans of all backgrounds who had bled and died together.At that service, Rabbi Roland B. Gittelsohn, the Marines\u0027 first-ever Jewish chaplain, gave a eulogy that has become one of the Marine Corps\u0027 most treasured texts. Noting the ersity of the dead, Gittelsohn said, \u0027Here lie officers and men, Negroes and whites, rich men and poor … together. Here are Protestants, Catholics, and Jews together. Here no man prefers another because of his faith or despises him because of his color.\u0027         At least 24 hours of footage was captured by cameramen from the Marines during the battle in February 1945         More than 50 Marine combat cameramen operated across the eight square miles of Iwo Jima during the battleGittelsohn called their collective sacrifice \u0027the highest and purest democracy.\u0027After the dedication ceremonies, Marines walked the 5th Division cemetery, looking for familiar names. The photographers were there, and one recorded the footage of the two Marines – names not known – and the dog, at a grave with only the number 322 as a visible marking.Wilsbacher said: \u0027The image stood out. The two Marines looking directly at the camera seemed to reach across the decades to compel a response. \u0027Researchers at the History Division identified the Marine beneath marker 322 as Pfc. Ernest Langbeen from Chicago. \u0027It felt appropriate and important to add his name to the online description for that film, so I did.\u0027I then located members of the Langbeen family, and told them that this part of their family\u0027s history existed in the History Division\u0027s collections and was now preserved and available online after more than seven decades.\u0027Speaking with the family, I learned more about the Marine in grave 322. \u0027One of the two Marines in the picture may well be his best friend from before the war, a friend who joined the Corps with him. \u0027They asked to serve together and were assigned to the same unit, the 13th Regiment.\u0027Now, family members who never knew this Marine have a new connection to their history and the country\u0027s history. More connections will come for others. \u0027The digital archive we\u0027re building will make it easier for researchers and the public at large to explore the military and personal history in each frame of every film.\u0027The visual library of more than 80 online videos from Iwo Jima carries in it countless Pfc. Langbeens, ordinary Americans whose lives were disrupted by a global war. Each film holds traces of lives cut short or otherwise irrevocably altered.\u0027The films are a reminder that, 75 years after World War II, all Americans remain tied to Iwo Jima, as well as battlegrounds across the world like Monte Cassino, Peleliu, Bataan and Colleville-sur-mer. \u0027Americans may find their relatives in this footage, or they may not. \u0027But what they will find is evidence of the sacrifices made by those fighting on their behalf, sacrifices that connect each and every American to the battle of Iwo Jima.\u0027            The photo of Marines planting the US flag atop Mount Suribachi after the Battle of Iwo Jima in February 1945 is one of the most iconic images from World War II  The Conversation Media Group Ltd Privacy Policy   "},{"url":null,"title":"Is Britains grumpiest landlord Pub owner makes customers pull pints","story":"Share this article He refused to tell a soul he had opened the pub and enjoyed getting drunk alone - but his brash and unorthodox manner created a buzz and the crowds began to flock back.He said: \u0027I was running the village shop seven years ago when the chance to take over the pub came up.

The 20 books in the running this year range from Kit de Waal’s first young adult novel, Becoming Dinah – a reimagining of Moby-Dick in which a teenage girl sets off on a trip in a camper van with a grumpy one-legged man – to Jennifer Donnelly’s take on Cinderella, Stepsister, and Sharon Dogar’s Monsters, about the creation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.A host of picture books up for the Kate Greenaway medal for illustration also give fresh takes on the classics. And the Ocean Was Our Sky, illustrated by Rovina Cai and written by Patrick Ness, tells the story of Moby-Dick from the perspective of the whale Quill Soup, illustrated by Dale Blankenaar, is an African retelling of the European folktale Stone Soup and Mary and Frankenstein, illustrated by Júlia Sardà and written by Linda Bailey, is another title to riff on the making of Frankenstein.This year also marks a first for the prize: Annet Schaap’s story of a lighthouse keeper’s daughter, Lampie, translated from Dutch by Laura Watkinson, is the the first translated book to be longlisted for the Carnegie. Chair of judges Julia Hale called it “as satisfyingly dark and light as the best fairy story adventures”.Taking as their mission “to inspire and empower the next generation to shape a better world through books and reading”, and focusing on finding an “outstanding reading experience”, judges also found a strong theme of homelessness and identity in the longlisted novels. In Susin Nielsen’s No Fixed Address, a boy and his mother live in a camper van, one step from homelessness, while in former winner Sarah Crossan’s Toffee, a teenager runs away from home and is taken in by an elderly woman with dementia. Angie Thomas’s On the Come Up follows an aspiring rapper trying to escape the poverty of her neighbourhood, while Nikesh Shukla’s The Boxer, about the aftermath of a racist attack, is “brilliantly nuanced”, said Hale, and left judges “simultaneously bruised, reeling and uplifted”.Hale said that among the 162 submissions for the two medals, there were lots of books about social media and the internet. But the titles chosen by a volunteer team of 14 children’s and youth librarians from across the UK were “more about universal things, like families and friendships and the way children and young people navigate the sort of challenges that they face in the world”.“Through writing and illustration, the authors and artists offer children and young people stories of hope, discovery and understanding about themselves and the world they live in,” said Hale. “There is a strong emphasis in the longlists on how young readers can navigate that journey, through relationships with families and friends and from learning more about themselves.”The shortlists for both prizes will be announced on 19 March, and the winners on 17 June.The Black Flamingo by Dean Atta, illustrated by Anshika KhullarA Pocketful of Stars by Aisha BushbyToffee by Sarah CrossanBecoming Dinah by Kit de WaalLouisiana’s Way Home by Kate DiCamilloMonsters by Sharon DogarStepsister by Jennifer DonnellyLenny’s Book of Everything by Karen FoxleeNowhere on Earth by Nick LakeLark by Anthony McGowanThe Skylarks’ War by Hilary McKayNo Fixed Address by Susin NielsenInkling by Kenneth OppelPatron Saints of Nothing by Randy RibayLampie written and illustrated by Annet Schaap and translated by Laura WatkinsonVoyages in the Underworld of Orpheus Black by Marcus Sedgwick and Julian Sedgwick, illustrated by Alexis DeaconThe Boxer by Nikesh ShuklaOn the Come Up by Angie ThomasGirl.

Lots of people are now saying ‘I’m sorry but this system sucks’.“In addition to being materially prosperous, we need empowerment and agency – that is the ability to shape our destiny through our own efforts – and we need solidarity – that is we need to be embedded within our social circles.”In a proposal floated ahead of the G20 summit in Saudi Arabia later this year, the dashboard would include four separate measurements of economic and social prosperity: GDP per capita and environmental performance, as well as two new indexes assessing the “solidarity” and “empowerment” of citizens.All four dimensions would need to be in harmony to show a country was adequately serving the needs of its citizens, according to the proposals drawn up by Snower and Katharina Lima de Miranda, an academic at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.The empowerment and solidarity indexes are drawn from existing major surveys of wellbeing compiled by the UN, World Bank and OECD, including assessments of job security, education levels, life expectancy, charitable activity, trust in strangers and confidence in government.Under the new dashboard, New Zealand, Finland and Iceland are among the most progressive nations on earth, while the US dramatically underperforms its level of GDP per head.India, China and Mexico rank among the worst performers on the dashboard of 35 nations.The report said that, over the past decade, the dashboard shows the empowerment of citizens and GDP levels in the UK have increased yet social solidarity has fallen, suggesting that the country has become more “neoliberal”.Although the plan could face resistance from some G20 nations and there is no guarantee the dashboard will ultimately be adopted, Snower said the proposal was the first stage in a drive to get countries to look beyond GDP as a signal of success.In the last four decades, globalisation and technological advances have generated significant growth in GDP, but have been accompanied by rising inequality, global heating and a sense of disempowerment among various groups.Several countries around the world are staging attempts to move beyond GDP and focus instead on the wellbeing of citizens. Last year, New Zealand’s Labour coalition government unveiled what it said was a “world-first” wellbeing budget, raising its spending on mental health services and tackling child poverty.Snower said that had nations monitored the wellbeing of citizens as much as GDP they would have had earlier warning signs about the fragmentation of society and rise of populist politics. He added: “Globalisation has costs that we’ve been blind to, and solidarity and empowerment have suffered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7cadbd63fb4cbdbec4af6cd168296a3c9853675/177_154_2104_1262/master/2104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62dde09573ca3a24e8831d82eab37df9","title":"tools to succeed small business owners reveal the tech they rely on","story":"You don’t have to be a giant of Silicon Valley to take advantage of AI. From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9415730b283fe47c3de76992534a285b6c3e2b46/24_0_3451_2072/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06d794b9e4070e1fda897c72f9c1973c","title":"bernie sanders democratic debate centrists","story":"The contest has become Bernie Sanders v a delusional sideshow of centrists bent on mutual annihilationWe have officially reached the Hunger Games stage of this Democratic primary season. The stage where you can grab the “horse-faced lesbian” weapon and hurl it at an “arrogant” billionaire within the first minutes of the show starting.It’s the stage where a young midwestern mayor can trash the experience of a midwestern senator, who turns right back at him and says, “Are you trying to say I’m dumb or are you mocking me here?” So much for all that midwestern niceness.There’s a reason why the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday turned into such an epic Donnybrook. It’s called the primary calendar, which is inexorably counting down to the Super Tuesday contests in less than two weeks.At that point, one of the candidates on stage will emerge with a delegate lead that puts an end to all the quadrennial talk of a brokered convention. At this point, that candidate looks like Bernie Sanders.In the meantime, his five rivals on the debate stage have engaged in an entirely delusional sideshow of mutual annihilation.The odds will never be in their favor. They don’t have the time for all the cannon fire before they lose the Nevada caucus and then watch Sanders sweep the majority of California delegates.Instead they engaged in an entirely futile effort to knock each other out of the contest so they could confront the frontrunner alone. This is something that Mike Bloomberg’s advisers acknowledged is the only realistic prospect of stopping Sanders.Which prompted Amy Klobuchar to accuse Bloomberg of telling women like her to wait her turn and step aside. If Elizabeth Warren hadn’t already thrown the horse-faced line at Bloomberg, Klobuchar might have earned a few of the many gasps of shock and awe that rumbled through the audience.Until now, each new frontrunner in this long primary contest has faded under the fire of everyone else. At various points over the last year, Kamala Harris hemmed, Elizabeth Warren wilted and Pete Buttigieg bumbled.By the time it was Bernie Sanders’ turn in the barrel, it was his great good fortune that most of the fire was turned on everyone else.“Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist?” asked NBC’s Chuck Todd, crystallizing in one short question how ludicrous this primary contest has become. Faced with a metaphysical question about his own existence, the Democrats’ favorite billionaire admitted the obvious. “I’ve made a lot of money, and I’m giving it away,” he said, justifying his existence with his munificence.On stage alongside a hostile gang of millionaires, our beleaguered billionaire found his stride by defending the otherwise defenseless figure of the American economy. “We’re not going to throw out capitalism,” he said, sounding unscripted and unplugged for the first time. “We tried that. Other countries tried that. It was called communism and it doesn’t work.”For the first time during the debate, there were more gasps from the people on stage than from those in the audience.This topical argument about capitalism v communism led to an awesome series of counterpunches. Bernie said Mike was wealthier than the bottom 125 million Americans. Mike said Bernie was a socialist millionaire with three homes. Elizabeth talked about a wealth tax. Mike said he wanted to roll back the tax cuts of the Obama, um, Trump administration.One of the many pitfalls of political analysis is the temptation to treat the next election like the last one. But hindsight is not foresight, even when the names and faces look familiar.This Democratic primary is not the same as it was four years ago nor is it like the Republican contest of the same cycle. After three years of Trumpian dysfunction and disinformation, nothing is the same.Take Bernie Sanders. Four years ago he was the bitter insurgent, railing against the establishment and capitalism, while trashing the delegate count. Today he is the clear frontrunner, railing against the establishment and capitalism, while loving the delegate count.Wednesday’s debate was meant to be the biggest test for the former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose lavish spending has launched him late into the primary spotlight.But the expectations of Bloomberg were somewhere between subway and sewer levels. He was supposedly so ill-prepared for public gaze, and such a clunky gazillionaire, that his ability to communicate with the great unwashed was limited to him buying the services of professional meme-bots.Somehow Bloomberg was underwhelming at the same time as overperforming. He crossed the bar in the most boring way possible.In substance and style, this is Sanders’ contest. He has skewed the entire field towards his socialized healthcare proposal known as Medicare for All, so that the supposedly centrist candidates are calling for a Sanders-lite plan that Barack Obama never proposed – because he couldn’t pass it through a Senate where Democrats held a filibuster-proof 60 votes.But it is the tone of the debate that Bernie owns, not just the policy frame. Nobody can turn his fire on other candidates like the Vermont senator. When pushed hard on how he would pay for his new public healthcare system, Sanders accused his critics of being owned by healthcare CEOs. When pushed for his long-promised medical records, Sanders challenged his questioners to join him for pushups on the campaign trail.Sanders doesn’t just dodge questions he destroys the questioner. On those terms, the other angry candidates sounded like pale imitations of the angry old socialist.Joe Biden said he was best equipped to beat Donald Trump. Mike Bloomberg said he would spend his money to beat Donald Trump. Amy Klobuchar said she won in Minnesota so she would obviously beat Donald Trump. Only Bernie Sanders sounded like he would dismember Donald Trump.This would be fine if there weren’t a billion dollars of disinformation headed towards Sanders for his socialism and his medical records. If there weren’t endless examples of successful scare tactics against socialists, Sanders could sail on regardless.Instead we face an election between a Democratic nominee who was pro-Soviet Russia versus a Republican president who is pro-Putin Russia. What a time to be alive.“We shouldn’t have to choose between a candidate who wants to burn this party down and another who wants to buy this party out,” said Mayor Pete in one of the lines his developers hardcoded into his haircut.They shouldn’t. But they will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6b71e01e3c027a2e41dcf4ce25d85f5918cdb1/0_0_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b79f3fe2d3fef4eae9507090a9c5f3eb","title":"the guardian view on a new immigration policy make it more than tabloid fodder","story":"The government’s proposed immigration reforms represent perhaps the biggest change to British life since the Maastricht treaty almost three decades ago gave Europeans the freedom to live and work in this country. It is to be regretted deeply that free movement of people, a high-minded ideal that was intended to make the European Union more popular, was weaponised to make membership so unpopular that the British public voted to leave the bloc. In its place, Boris Johnson proposes new routes for high-skilled migrants to enter Britain while closing the door on large-scale unskilled immigration.For Mr Johnson, having decided immigration was the driver of the Brexit vote, there is no trade-off between controlling borders and trading with Europe. From next year businesses can no longer recruit from outside the UK for unskilled workers and will only offer jobs to those with an A-level or above and who are to be paid more than £25,600 annually. There will be a level playing field for immigrants from the EU and the rest of the world. For certain privileged categories – the plans cite foreign nurses – there will be exceptions. The government says overall numbers of migrants will fall. Ministers might be right, but it’s not certain. If the economy suffers – the sudden loss of EU workers may lead to widespread labour shortages – then we may see ministers U-turn and relax the rules further to let numbers rise.At the heart of the debate lies an argument about class interests. It has been argued that the benefits of low-wage immigration flow largely to the affluent consumers of labour-intensive services, while the costs fall on low-wage workers. The starkest version of this analysis claims the wealthy wanted to run businesses with low-wage employees while their children could be looked after by cheap domestic help. Until the Labour party can defeat these arguments, expect Mr Johnson to press home the political advantage. What works in politics may not in economics. On farms there will be lettuce that needs picking and potatoes that must be harvested. Foreign labour is imported to do that work because workers here will not. If crops end up rotting in fields, how will the government react? Given that the hospitality sector runs on EU labour, who will staff the hotels and restaurants that Britons use for weekend breaks and family outings?Priti Patel, the home secretary, was grasping at straws when she said that businesses ought to enlist the 8 million “economically inactive” to plug the gaps. She argued that industry will be forced to increase training of local hires and raise levels of pay to attract UK talent. That may be right, but if the argument works in the unskilled sector then why not apply the same rationale to software coders? And what of the jobs that do not need training or an apprenticeship? The decision by No 10 to hire Prof Alison Wolf to look at local training and education is a sign that such questions are not being left, thankfully, to Ms Patel.Mr Johnson has to balance the interests of leave voters with the economic interests that have traditionally shaped the Conservative party. Nowhere is this more obvious than in social care, where big chains, often owned by private equity, claim that without cheap labour their businesses, squeezed by local authority cuts, might not be viable. Ministers might reclassify social care as skilled labour to enable foreign workers to be imported and resolve a brewing crisis. But there is a wider problem about how jobs that need empathy, kindness and patience are seen in Whitehall. It speaks volumes about the lack of thought given to a workforce needed to look after us in our old age. Mr Johnson has dressed up his policies to be tabloid fodder, with headlines about immigrants having to speak English. This is deplorable, rabble-rousing stuff. However, he ought to be credited for tapping into questions not just of immigration, but more profound ones about the nature of work. Too little attention has been paid to those doing jobs which carry little social prestige. We will notice these workers when they are no longer here.

These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce. Identify one metric to improve upon, set a deadline, and keep track of the progress.Empower your business.

No one wants it but I don’t feel like I have a choice,” said Anh Le, who teaches political theory at Manchester University.“This is the third big strike in three years. My work, research and teaching are disrupted. My students are angry but they understand we’re doing this not just for ourselves but for the future of British education as well.”Some university staff expressed anger at the amount of money being spent on new university buildings and vice-chancellor salaries, rather than on improving staff pay and conditions.Students, meanwhile, were upset and bewildered about the loss of tuition and the impact on their degrees, but many blamed university management rather than their lecturers.“I work very hard to give my students the best education I can, so I feel an element of guilt that they will be adversely affected,” said an academic at Heriot Watt University. “However, the assault on pay and conditions in universities has been going on too long, and eventually you just can’t ignore that and have to look after yourself.“I am fed up hearing how my university – and others – can’t afford a decent increase in staff pay when I continually see new buildings, vanity projects in many cases, being constructed on campus.”Andrea Graf, a lecturer in psychology at Roehampton University, said she would also go on strike: “It stresses me to strike, but this is less stressful than not striking … the university is not a place of education and learning and at times it feels like it is a sausage factory. It is absolutely necessary, but I will struggle financially by taking part.”An international student, Eric Vu, studying design management and cultures at University of the Arts London, said the strike action meant he would lose a third of of his contact time with tutors, which he estimated was worth £200 a week.Vu said he supported the strike, and criticised money being spent on renovations and “utilities such as fancy catering and new buildings” rather than investing in teaching and research.Not everyone who contacted the  supported the strike, however. One lecturer in the politics department at the University of Edinburgh, calling it misguided.“A very large proportion of my department is intending to strike but I feel strongly that I should not strike. Although I would certainly not mind being paid more, lecturers have comfortable salaries.“And while I cannot speak to others’ circumstances, my workload is not oppressive in the least – I used to work at a university in the States where demands were much greater. There are those of us staff who believe strongly that the rationale for the strike is misguided.”Earlier this week, university employers said they had moved a long way to address staff concerns but union demands on pensions, pay and conditions were unaffordable and would put vulnerable institutions that were already in deficit at even greater risk.Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “Vice-chancellors have had months to come up with serious offers to avoid widespread disruption on UK campuses. Their failings are clear for all to see today and the blame for the disruption caused by the strikes lays squarely at their door.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7ac4fbab07bdf3a19fa238d67d7cdf0587f27b/0_329_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c782b65399620bfb13aecd940af4bc3","title":"ancient fish meals chart sahara climate shift savannah desert","story":"Bones of fish eaten by humans thousands of years ago offer clue to region’s ancient climateThe Sahara’s shift from savannah with abundant lakes to a largely arid expanse has been traced in the remains of fish eaten thousands of years ago. It is not the first time fish remains have been found in what are now dry regions of the desert, but the team say it is the first time the ancient climate of the region has been traced through animal remains.The discovery is the latest in a string of finds from the large Takarkori rock shelter, a site, about 50-60 metres long and 30 metres high, that is thought to have been first used by hunter gatherers more than 10,000 years ago.Prof Savino di Lernia, a co-author of the study from Sapienza University of Rome, said previous finds at the shelter included evidence of rock art, the earliest signs in Africa of wild cereals being cultivated and their seeds stored, and evidence from pottery shards of dairy practices in Africa dating back nearly 7,000 years ago.Naturally mummified human remains of Neolithic pastoralists have also been discovered at the shelter, while the uppermost layers of the site are composed of dung left by the animals of nomadic herders that later camped at the site between 5,900 and 4,650 years ago.“The amount of fish is decreasing through time and the contribution of mammals increases, showing that people at Takarkori focussed gradually more on hunting and livestock keeping,” the authors write. But, they add: “It is unclear if this was an intentional process or if this shift could be related to increasing aridity, which made the environment less favourable for fishes.”The findings chime with previous evidence from the Sahara, including from sediments and geological features, that have highlighted a shift in the climate from a wetter environment with vegetation and abundant lakes more than 10,000 years ago, to a period of fluctuating dry and wet conditions, until about 5,500 years ago the region became increasingly arid, resulting in the landscape seen today.Dr Clayton Magill of Heriot-Watt University, who was not part of the research team but previously explored climate change in the African savannah, said the shift to desert conditions in the Sahara region was one of the most remarkable ecological transitions in the Earth’s recent past.

Hidden from view, models are transformed from gawky 19-year-olds into the living embodiment of a luxury brand’s vision via the judicious application of make-up and wigs.The Gucci show in Milan on Wednesday took an unexpected turn, then, by positioning its backstage area on a revolving curtained platform in the middle of the catwalk. Dry ice filled the room, the curtain raised and the key players were revealed: models in their white dressing gowns, make-up artists, hair stylists and dressers, brushing hair, applying lipstick, pulling up socks and arranging hat brims just so. The soundtrack, Ravel’s Bolero, lent a balletic air to the calm, methodical work.“I wanted to show what happens on the other side,” said creative director Alessandro Michele after his show. “Fashion is not only about garments, about clothing. That is only part of the story. I wanted to say that fashion is a complex mechanism. It is also a ritual. Something sacred, liturgical, almost like a religion.”Michele has been an industry sensation since 2015, when he radically transformed Gucci, then a fading icon of glossy noughties glamour, into a purveyor of quirky, eccentric maximalist chic. His shows present a disparate cast of characters, who appear to have been beamed in from the world’s most comprehensive and luxurious thrift shop. This season’s stand-out looks included full-skirted, Tudor-style dresses styled with bondage harnesses and high-shine neck cuffs, and black velvet dresses with Puritan collars. There was a childlike air to some of the collection – socks pulled up to the knee, a buttercup yellow knee-length dress with a Peter Pan collar.Michele said he had been thinking about his childhood a lot, and collecting vintage children’s clothing from the second world war, and from the 1970s, which he found inspiring “in the perfection of its proportions and its freedom. Children don’t have to justify what they do or what they wear.” There were crucifixes too, which Michele said tied into the ritualistic nature of fashion and attending a fashion show, “a symbol of belonging, of loyalty to something”.In its celebration of difference and iniduality the Michele era at Gucci aims to distill the aspirations for a certain type of open-minded, urban, millennial consumer, with whom it has had a large amount of success. Brand ambassadors include Harry Styles, who wore a Gucci suit with pearl necklace and, later, a Gucci lace jumpsuit to the Brit awards on Tuesday night.A number of incidents have undermined that inclusive vision, however, notably the backlash around a polo-neck jumper that looked offensively like blackface, and had to be removed from shops last February. Afterwards the brand apologised and appointed a ersity chief.The Kering CEO, Francois-Henri Pinault, recently warned investors to expect a dip: “Our environment has changed significantly with the coronavirus outbreak. Due to the evolving nature of the situation, it is impossible at this time to fully evaluate the impact on business and how fast it will recover.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4efeb570ed0db93a115d8f4c8be066f9f54bf4ae/0_0_3663_2198/master/3663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fa2c6b014cca8e92a527840a3575aef","title":"london fashion week autumnwinter 2020 the key shows in pictures","story":"This season saw a heady mix of schedule regulars as well as up-and-coming stars – with a focus on sustainability "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1da1e51244581d55f75008b0abe74637402588df/0_210_4947_2968/master/4947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6470a2f11a7d79bd3b42a450d104f6d","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury day two deliberations","story":"Jurors wanted to reread Miriam Haley’s testimony and asked to see Weinstein and Haley’s emails on day two of deliberations The jury at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial in New York is wrestling with one of the most fiercely contested aspects of the case – the contact the disgraced movie mogul maintained with his accusers even after he allegedly sexually assaulted them.As the jury entered the second day of their deliberations at the New York supreme court in Manhattan on Wednesday, the five women and seven men sent a note to the judge asking to see key evidence relating to Miriam Haley, a former Project Runway assistant producer. They want to be reread Haley’s testimony relating to when she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Weinstein in July 2006 as well as a second encounter in which she had sex with him in a Beverly Hills hotel about two weeks later.The jurors also asked to see all emails between Weinstein and Haley, and between Weinstein and any third party relating to Haley.The requests appear to go to the heart of the most fraught element of the Weinstein prosecution in which he faces possible life imprisonment on five counts of rape, forced oral sex and predatory sexual assault. In an exceptionally rare move, the New York district attorney’s office decided to press ahead to trial with two main accusers – one of whom is Haley – who kept in touch with their alleged attacker even after they claim they were sexually assaulted by him.That aspect of the case has been heavily emphasized by Weinstein’s defense lawyers. In cross-examination, Haley admitted she had accepted plane tickets to Los Angeles and London paid for by Weinstein shortly after the alleged sex attack, and that she kept in touch with him professionally via email.“You wanted a connection with Mr Weinstein to help your career,” Damon Cheronis, a lawyer on the defense team, asked her on the witness stand.In her testimony, Haley said that she had been lured to Weinstein’s apartment on 10 July 2006. There he turned on her, pushed her on to his bed and forced her to have oral sex.When she protested that she was on her period, he allegedly yanked out her tampon and carried on. “I was just crying, ‘No.’ I kept trying to tell him, ‘No, don’t go there.’ I was in such shock that I just checked out,” she told the court.The jury has asked to have that part of her testimony reread to them. They also want to hear again the section of the court transcript in which she described agreeing to meet Weinstein again just two weeks later on 26 July 2006 in the Tribeca Grand hotel in Beverly Hills.Asked why she would have accepted an invitation to meet her alleged attacker so soon after a violent and degrading experience, she said: “I feel like I was trying to regain some sort of power or something.”In tune with their general strategy, Weinstein’s lawyers have made much of the second sexual encounter, which is not included in the charges. In cross-examination and in closing arguments they have argued it proves that Haley was in a consensual sexual relationship with the defendant and that she lied about him forcing oral sex on to her in the earlier incident.In fact, Haley’s testimony about the Tribeca Grand incident is far more ambiguous than that. “I just laid there. He had intercourse with me. I was laying there motionless, I felt like an idiot and I felt numb,” she said.Her testimony described a sexual event that was not so much consensual but one in which she failed to resist. Asked whether Weinstein had forced himself on her at the Tribeca Grand, she replied: “I didn’t physically resist but I felt that, yeah.”The jury is now grappling with what to make of all these interactions. The eventual interpretation they reach could have immense consequences, resulting in a possible acquittal on a couple of the five counts facing Weinstein or alternatively conviction of a criminal sex act that carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison.By Wednesday afternoon the jury appeared to have moved on from Haley to consider the evidence relating to Sciorra. They sent a fresh request to the judge asking to reread the testimony of the actor Rosie Perez who said she had been told by her friend Sciorra that she had been raped.The jury also wanted to see all emails and digital communication between Weinstein and his friend Paul Feldsher, who was called by the defense to give evidence. Feldsher testified that Sciorra had told him she had done a “crazy thing with Harvey” – implying that their sexual encounter was consensual and not rape.But Feldsher’s testimony backfired on Weinstein when the witness was forced under cross-examination to admit that he had called the defendant a “sex addict”.As an additional request, the jury asked to see all emails between Weinstein and Black Cube, the detective firm of former Israeli intelligence agents employed by the defendant to investigate Sciorra before she went public with her allegations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/494fbf7d3a6ead262fe1cbacf7b21786f5de0d47/0_167_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=149e7efe7d1466f4658d39090bd2fecb","title":"atalanta produce a night to remember in defeat of valencia","story":"Hans Hateboer scored twice as Atalanta beat Valencia 4-1 in the first leg of the Champions League’s round of 16, putting the Italian team on the verge of extending their first season in the competition.Roughly a third of the population of the small town of Bergamo was present at the San Siro stadium to see Hateboer, Josip Ilii and Remo Freuler score for Atalanta.The substitute Denis Cheryshev scored a consolation goal for Valencia to give the Spanish team a glimmer of hope for the second leg on 10 March.Atalanta was forced into a late change as the defender Berat Djimsiti picked up a knock during the warmup and had to be replaced by Mattia Caldara.The home side started brightly and Alejandro Gómez sent a free kick narrowly over before Mario Paali forced a smart stop from the Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Doménech.Atalanta broke the deadlock in the 16th minute when Hateboer slid in at the back post to turn in Gómez’s cross from the left. Robin Gosens hit the side-netting shortly afterwards before Valencia got into the match and almost levelled on the half-hour mark following a quickly-taken free kick, but Ferrán Torres effort crashed off the right-hand post.Valencia went close again when Gonçalo Guedes’s cross-shot flew past Eliaquim Mangala sliding in at the far post.But Atalanta doubled their lead three minutes from the interval as Ilii held off two defenders before firing into the top left corner.Atalanta dominated from the restart and Freuler extended his side’s lead in the 57th minute, curling a spectacular effort into the top right corner. The noise in the stadium was ramped up even more five minutes later when Hateboer ran almost half the length of the pitch before shooting past Doménech. Cheryshev replaced Guedes in the 64th minute and pulled one back for Valencia two minutes later, drilling a low shot into the bottom corner.Atalanta qualified for Europe’s top competition for the first time after a surprise third-place finish in Serie A last season. And they progressed to the knockout stages despite losing their first three matches in the competition.They are playing their matches at San Siro as their own stadium did not meet Uefa requirements.

They recovered from this position when they broke Ajax’s hearts and reached the Champions League final last season. Last May, however, Spurs had the option of bringing Fernando Llorente off the bench and spreading chaos with an aerial bombardment.This time there is no target man to unleash in emergency situations and José Mourinho, who has been joking about bringing Peter Crouch out of retirement, is painfully aware the attacking crisis is not going to ease any time soon.The hamstrung Harry Kane is unlikely to return until April at the earliest. Son Heung-min may not play again this season after fracturing his right arm. Unless Mourinho suddenly turns to Troy Parrott, the 18-year-old Irish prospect, his squad will contain no recognised strikers when they travel to Germany for the second leg on 10 March.Spurs struggled as an attacking force for much of this uneven contest. Lucas Moura was ineffective against a side missing their three first-choice centre-backs. Dele Alli played a more advanced role than usual but his main contribution was throwing a water bottle and one of his boots to the ground after being substituted in the 64th minute.Leipzig were superior throughout and while Mourinho refused to throw in the towel he stressed that the one attacking player on his bench, Erik Lamela, was not even fit enough to train properly the day before the game.The consolation for Spurs is the damage could have been more severe. Leipzig, a point behind Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga, were a class above and Julian Nagelsmann’s slick side should have had more to show for their efforts than a penalty from Timo Werner, the game’s outstanding player.What a start Leipzig made. While their 32-year-old manager has been dubbed the Mini Mourinho, Nagelsmann has been at pains to suggest his style is closer to Pep Guardiola and it was astonishing to watch the Germans break through the lines with those electrifying early surges. The first two minutes must have felt like two hours for Spurs and Hugo Lloris had to be at his best to preserve his side’s dignity.The first warning shot came from Patrik Schick, volleying just wide from 18 yards, and the next sequence of events beggared belief. A cross from the right reached Werner, who saw his goalbound effort blocked by Davinson Sánchez. Angeliño charged in from the left flank and struck a shot that Lloris erted on to the near post. The danger passed once Lloris had smothered another jab from Werner.The only thing missing was a goal and that allowed Spurs to gain a foothold. They shook their heads clear and remembered that Leipzig were stretched at the back because of Dayot Upamecano’s suspension and injuries to Ibrahima Konaté and Willi Orban. They went close to taking the lead when Steven Bergwijn, who has impressed since joining from PSV Eindhoven last month, tested Peter Gulacsi with an excellent curling effort.Yet Leizpig remained in control. Their 3-4-3 system gave them the edge, especially on the flanks, and Werner’s elusive movement, that easy way he drifted into pockets of space from his starting position on the left of the front three, showed why he is coveted by Bayern, Chelsea and Liverpool. Werner’s only problem was finding a way past Lloris the Spurs goalkeeper denied him again in the 36th minute.That ability to hang on in games has been a feature of Spurs’ recent wins but relying on opponents fluffing their lines in front of goal is hardly a recipe for success in the long run. Mourinho could not bank on another 45 minutes of carelessness from Leipzig. He had seen Marcel Sabitzer and Konrad Laimer outpass Harry Winks and Giovani Lo Celso in midfield. Gedson Fernandes was quiet. Spurs had to show more adventure and there was more aggression at the start of the second half, Serge Aurier whipping in a cross for Moura. Gulacsi saved the Brazilian’s flick and Bergwijn steered the rebound wide.In the 56th minute, Werner veered in from the left and chipped a ball towards Laimer, who controlled with his chest before falling over a clumsy challenge from Ben Davies. It was a blatant foul from the Spurs left-back and Werner fizzed a low penalty past Lloris.Leipzig might have killed the game on the break. Angeliño burst down the left and Werner’s brilliant dummy left Schick in the clear but Lloris pushed the striker’s shot away.While Spurs raised their level, going close when Gulacsi tipped the increasingly influential Lo Celso’s free-kick wide, Leipzig were comfortable. Ethan Ampadu, the on-loan Chelsea defender, cruised through the game and Spurs have it all to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c723fd45f69662f8b889456fb707192fb94d62c/0_310_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894e76b527b4785e48ebff2e15ac2aad","title":"coal workers are orphans the children and slaves mining pakistans coal","story":"Injuries and fatalities are common among thousands of debt-bonded men and children toiling in one of the world’s harshest work environmentsAll photographs by Mashal Balochby  Shah Meer Baloch and  Hannah Ellis-PetersenThe spectre of death hovers over the coal mines of Balochistan. Under scorching skies, this turbulent south-west region of Pakistan is home to one of the world’s harshest work environments, where tens of thousands of men and children descend below the surface each day to dig up thousands of tonnes of coal.The threats of underground explosions, methane gas poisoning, suffocation, or mine walls collapsing are omnipresent and there is barely a single worker across the state’s five massive commercial coal mines who has not been touched by the fatalities that are common here.“Twenty people that I know of have died underground,” says Luqman Shakir, a 24-year-old from Swat, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Nine years ago, aged 15, Shakir travelled to Balochistan looking for work he has been a miner ever since. “People often die because of a mine collapse and it takes us 18, sometimes 24, hours to take them out because there is no machinery to remove the collapse we are on our own.”Wiping his dust-blackened face, Shakir sighs. “When we pull them out, often their bodies are so mangled they cannot even be recognised. Every time I go down the mine, in the back of my mind I always know there is a possibility that I might not come back up.”Shakir hasn’t seen a sunset for almost a decade. He goes underground before dawn and emerges after dark six days a week, and sleeps for most of his single day off. “Summers are suffocating,” he says, explaining that his impoverished background and lack of education make the mines his only option for work.“This is my life now.”Coal was first extracted in the mineral-rich Balochistan in the 1850s by the British, who built the railway line still used today to transport the coal through the treacherous mountains of the Bolan Pass.It has grown into a massive modern industry. With five major coalfields – Mach, Shahrag, Dukki, Chamalang and Quetta – Balochistan still has approximately 2.2bn tonnes of coal reserves. As a result, the mining operation across the state is huge at least 15,000 tonnes of coal are produced daily, selling for an of average 14,000 PKR (£70) per tonne. It is big business for the country’s coffers, too. The provincial government takes a cut of 130 PKR (£0.65) per tonne and the federal government 500 PKR (£2.50).An operation on this scale requires a massive workforce at the Mach coal mines alone it is estimated that there are between 10,000 and 20,000 workers. Child labour is rife: at all the coal mines visited by the  in January, child labourers were seen working above ground sorting coal, collecting iron and picking up pieces of coal spilled across the fields.“Coal workers in Balochistan are orphans,” says Asif Qambrani, a research scholar whose work focuses on the mining industry in the region.At the mine in Shahrag, sitting on the floor working to remove impurities from freshly mined coal, are Noor Mohammed Marri, 15, and nine-year-old Gul Zaman Marri, who earn between 300 and 400 PKR (£1.50-£2) a day.“My father had died due to an accident so I am an orphan and I have no one except a few family elders and one of them is working here,” says Noor. “We come here to do some work under his supervision. We can’t survive if we don’t work.”There have been multiple recent reports of child sexual abuse at the mines in Shahrag, and while Noor is adamant he has not been harassed, he says he fears for other young orphans who have no family working in the mines to look out for them.The story of the coal miners of Balochistan is one of debt bondage and human rights abuses, an absence of basic health and safety measures, and brutal working and living conditions. Many of the conditions of modern slavery are evident across these mines, which have not modernised in decades. Adult miners earn around £5 a day. Pakistan’s first Mines Act was passed in 1923 to enshrine workers’ rights. It stipulates that canteens, shelters, medical equipment and first aid rooms should be provided at every mine where more than 100 people are employed. Yet there was no obvious sign of these facilities when the  visited the Mach and Shahrag mines. At Mach, the workers’ quarters were a mud building in which more than 10 people shared each tiny room. There was no electricity, running water or a proper bathroom, and drinking water was not provided.The issues are compounded by the fact that that many of the workers have either migrated from Swat or neighbouring Afghanistan, and are not legally registered, meaning their very existence – and therefore their rights – can be easily dismissed. According to the Mines Act, all workers should be registered with firms and leaseholders. But there is little pressure from the authorities to enforce this.“The problem in Balochistan is that most coal mine owners and leaseholders are either influential people in Karachi and Lahore who took ownership in the 1950s and 1960s and have never even visited the mines themselves to see the conditions, or they are politicians, feudal or tribal chiefs who are in provincial and central government,” says Qambrani. “These owners never enforce registration of mine workers because then they have to provide all basic facilities, which would decrease their profits.”There is also little will or incentive for the state government to enforce the act’s provisions or subsequent iterations of the law intended to regulate the industry. Many key provincial assembly members are either owners of mines or have major stakes in Balochistan’s mining industry, including Jam Kamal Khan, who is both the state’s chief minister and minister for mining and minerals. Khan declined to comment when approached by the .According to the Pakistan Central Mines Labour Federation, between 100 and 200 labourers die on average in coal mine accidents every year, but many incidents go unreported. In January a Mach miner was trapped for over 48 hours and had to be dug out by fellow workers after the government failed to help with the rescue operation. In February, four miners died in a landslide at Duki. According to figures taken from records and news reports, from 2010 to May 2019 at least 414 miners were killed, though the real total is thought to be much higher.The unforgiving conditions take a heavy toll on the body. Many workers spoke of the constant threat of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease, an incurable but preventable illness caused by inhaling coal mine dust. Bakth Nazar, a 55-year-old coal manager at a mine in Mach, says he has worked in the coalfields for about 30 years. In that time he has lost three family members in coal mines – including his son – due to the unsafe conditions.“We work with no facilities, no training and no safety measures,” says Nazar. “But the dilemma for us is that we don’t get paid when we don’t work. The company doesn’t care about our health.”“The government did not pay a penny for my brother Azam Khan and cousin who got trapped in coal mines and died last year,” says Nazar.Speaking on condition of anonymity, one mine inspector candidly depicts the horrors he has seen workers endure. Necessary breathing equipment is deemed “too expensive” and therefore not provided, he says. He also describes how a lack of training for workers can have dire consequences.He recounts one incident at a mine in Dagari in August 2019, where a cable caught fire underground and ignited gas within the mine, causing workers to fall unconscious and become trapped. Due to a lack of training for such scenarios, other workers and management turned on the fans, which only served to fuel the fire. In that incident two people died and eight suffered life-changing burns.“There are no emergency ambulances in the majority of coalfields and their surrounding areas. There is a lack of basic health units and hospitals. And even if by luck there is a hospital, you won’t find a doctor or equipment there. There is nothing inspectors can do,” he says.Khaliqdad Bugti, in charge of a mine in Shahrag, describes how during rainy season the roads often become blocked, leaving workers stranded without food for days and with only their mud huts to shelter in.Debt bondage is also a huge issue. Mohammed Ibrahim, a frail 40-year-old with one hand, explains that this is the situation in which he has found himself. Hundreds of miles away from his home and seven children in Afghanistan, Ibrahim works as a haulage driver to pay off the 50,000 PKR (£250) he borrowed from the manager of the coal mine to get this job in the first place.“I chose this work because I couldn’t find any other work,” says Ibrahim, “It is very difficult but I have no other way of paying off the debt. I have to work here until I pay the debt.”As well as being a mine manager, Ali works as a jori-sir, whose task is to find and provide mine workers for the contractor – mainly from poverty-stricken villages. He earns at least 10 PKR for each labourer he provides.“I find labourers and jobless people and provide them advance money if they need it, and in return bring them to work here in coal mines,” says Ali. “They will keep working until they pay the debts. I know who owes money and they are not allowed to leave. This business is being run on debt between labourers to petty managers. Labourers owe me money and I owe money to the contractor. In short, we both can’t leave until we pay our money.”The fatalities keep coming. When the  visited the Shahrag mine in January, an incident had occurred just 10 days earlier. Two workers, Faiz Mohammed and Samiullah, who had travelled from Afghanistan in desperate search of work and ended up in the mines, died after a mining trolley broke, throwing their bodies 1,000ft into the pit. Ghulam Raza, another worker at Mach who is originally from Ghazni in Afghanistan, describes the daily fear that has haunted him since he witnessed a portion of a mine wall collapse, killing a co-worker. The death was never investigated. “I got really scared,” says Raza. “When the incident happened, no one came from the government, not even an ambulance. The Frontier Corps just came to inquire about what happened and then told us to take the body to the bazar.”“Due to my debt, I cannot go back to my wife and son,” says Raza. “But if I had a choice, I wouldn’t stay an hour longer here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92bb70990d1368610092081791f93f45164700ba/0_0_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a357d034e3d1983b6eb69e0d864d4a5","title":"space austerity plane seats and change rooms neednt bring out our worst","story":"Hell is other people in confined spaces – but remembering each other’s humanity is the best antidote to late capitalism’s callousnessIf you don’t normally subscribe to the idea that hell is other people, you might after a long-haul flight in economy class. Seats reclined up against your face, legs manspreading into your tiny space and – my personal misanthropy fuel – a stranger’s bare feet poking in between the seats.Thanks to the internet and the ubiquity of air rage videos on social media, you don’t even have to be flying to be drawn into this maddening coupling of deep discomfort and pure intimacy with strangers. In the latest one, a woman sits with her seat reclined on an American Airlines flight, filming over her shoulder. Behind her, a man slouches in his chair, with one hand up, punching the back of her seat incessantly. The video reignited the extremely tedious and never-ending debate about reclining your seat. As with most things, I was on the writer Roxane Gay’s side: “Reclining is impolite but punching someone’s seat over and over and over … That is even more wrong.”Every time one of these videos surfaces, it’s hard not to think we should save plenty of ire for the airlines themselves. I make no excuses for the seat-punching jerk, but there is an absurdity to endlessly debating the etiquette here without asking – maybe it’s also the seats, and the companies who profit from selling them so close together, that are the problem?Air travel is getting more uncomfortable: people are getting bigger but seats are generally getting smaller and closer together. The flight attendants’ union in the US last year warned this cramming was a safety issue, increasing conflict while also running the risk of making emergency evacuations slower. The trade-off for cheaper air travel over the past few decades has been a relentless pursuit of efficiency of space, which literally pits us against each other.But it’s not just air travel. So many spaces where we interact with each other in the era of late capitalism bring out our absolute worst and threaten to make cranks of us all.We jostle and squabble in queues at underfunded public services. We grow irritated stuck on buses behind streams of slow cyclists in cities that have failed to build proper bike lanes. We find ourselves cursing into strangers’ armpits or tussling with their backpacks on overcrowded public transport.I always feel like I’ve entered a scene from The Purge anytime I’ve shopped at Zara at lunchtime. The ratio of customers to change rooms in their stores always seems to be 7,000:1, leading women to try on what they can in the aisles – strewing clothes around the store, clogging the floors and fighting for mirror space. At sale time, you can feel like you need body armour.At the core of all these issues is usually bad design and organisation, with profit, private interests and cost-cutting, not people, in mind. In spaces where human needs seem like an afterthought, it’s little wonder our empathy diminishes. And it’s a burden felt by some more than others. These are largely situations some pay their way out of – there aren’t too many air rage videos coming out of first class, or fights over mirror space in Miu Miu. You’re less likely to think hell is other people when you don’t have to be squeezed up against them constantly as you move through the world.In a rankling epilogue to last week’s viral video, the CEO of Delta airlines dispensed some etiquette advice about reclining: “I think that the proper thing to do is if you’re going to recline into somebody, that you ask if it’s OK first,” he said. Of course he would – the forbearance of passengers even under increasingly undignified circumstances is integral to the business model at this point.But trying to hold on to our humanity in these vexing situations is more than worth it for us. Firstly, obviously, because it makes life more bearable. But secondly, because it’s camaraderie and seeing people around you as real, whole people, not just competitors for space, or objects to be wedged in place, that is the best antidote to the ruthless ideology shaping these experiences in the first place.On one trip home to Australia from the US a few years back I found myself wondering what I had done wrong in a past life to be sat next to bodybuilder – a giant of a man with arms and legs like felled logs that tumbled over the armrests and out from the bounds of his seat. He started chatting to me – loudly – as soon as I sat down, in his thick New Jersey accent, as he wiped beads of sweat from his brow.I quickly realised the poor guy was overcome with nerves. He confessed to me he’d never actually been on a plane before, but he had to, because he’d fallen for an Australian girl. She was from Queensland, a dancer on a cruise ship. He showed me pictures of her on his phone (“bewdiful, right?”). She wanted him to come meet her family. He was crazy about her. So he booked a damn flight.All my irritation melted away and I found myself both getting very invested in this transpacific love story and taking on the role of flight doula. I asked him questions about toning my glutes I would literally never put in to practise to keep him talking, while sharing all the usual soothing platitudes about the relative safety of air travel. I also gave him permission to squeeze my arm if he got scared. For the next 14 hours I had almost no legroom, no armrest and no sleep, with a big stranger’s hand gripping my forearm intermittently. And I wasn’t the least bit mad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de59ce3ce85880754de01de579900e72b9aa3891/0_59_5109_3066/master/5109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f6109a90ef6de1b15ec3c184d34fe2d","title":"brits 2020 the best of the red carpet and ceremony in pictures","story":"The highlights from the 40th Brit Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e442b6fddbea0c4dc9ae84c55f67c34544db73/0_23_5440_3265/master/5440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6c05afb2bf5ba9854b2f01f18708061","title":"weatherwatch scott of the antarctics most dreadful hours","story":"In February 1904 the explorer’s ship was stuck on a shoal being battered by heavy seas and a howling galeIt is February 1904 and Robert Falcon Scott’s ship is on a shoal off the coast of Antarctica. “We were in the worst possible position, dead to windward of the bank, with wind, sea and current all tending to set us faster ashore,” he writes in The Voyage of the Discovery (1905).“The hours that followed were truly the most dreadful I have ever spent.

The choice of destination can be overwhelming, let alone picking an inidual resort. And don’t expect Google to have the answer. Unless the question is: “Which ski resorts are best at search engine optimisation?”Here’s everything you need to know about skiing in France, Switzerland and Japan.Family-friendly fun in FranceTypical ski season: December-MayThe appeal is helped by France’s proximity to the UK, which means short flight times and plenty of low-cost airline choice, along with the opportunity to drive or take the environmentally-friendly train option.And French resorts are especially good for family snow trips, thanks to their English-speaking ski schools, tailored beginner areas and fun snow parks for kids. Many resorts also have an impressive array of non-ski activities to keep things enjoyable for children.Nestled in an enchanted pine forest at 1,750 metres, Club Med Les Arcs Panorama is a great choice for families, as it’s right on the slopes and has children’s classes and clubs available from four months up. Kids will love the playful animal sculptures dotted around the property, the ski trails through the woods and the resort’s famed toboggan runs.A luxury treat in SwitzerlandTypical ski season: November-MaySkiing in Switzerland is for those who want to push the boat out – a place of chocolate box beauty, where time appears to have stood still. But its popularity with Britons is also because it boasts some of the best ski resorts in Europe, with great pistes for all levels, excellent snow records, and renowned ski schools.Saint-Moritz was the world’s first winter sports resort and continues to have a reputation for glitz and glamour. By staying at the Club Med Saint-Moritz Roi Soleil you can enjoy all the chicness from a safe distance, knowing the price of your all-inclusive holiday was fixed in advance. The resort is linked to the extensive Engadin valley, and off-piste activities include Nordic skiing, riding in horse-drawn carriages and cosy fondue suppers.Crowd-free adventures in JapanTypical ski season: December-MarchHeading to Japan is the ultimate choice for adventurous skiers and snowboarders who want a fresh and original take on their winter break. Yes, you have to travel farther, but once you’re there Japan will more than deliver on the experience, as more and more British travellers are discovering each year.Hokkaido in the north of the country is the premier spot for skiing and snowboarding.

It said this showed councils were not the block to the government’s target of creating 300,000 new homes a year.Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary, is reportedly considering taking planning powers away from councils in an attempt to speed up housebuilding. Ministers are due to produce a long-awaited white paper on shaking up the planning system in the next few months.Last week the government announced that eight local councils in London, the south-east or east of England would lose some planning powers after failing to meet targets for completed new homes.The LGA found that the number of granted planning permissions for new homes in England almost doubled between 2012-13 and 2018-19, from 198,800 to 361,800.While the organisation acknowledges there is an inevitable time lag between permissions being granted and the homes being built, it notes that over the same period the number of newbuild completions has risen more slowly, from 118,540 to 213,860.The LGA argues the figures show that rather than taking planning powers from councils, the white paper should consider other measures, notably allowing local authorities to build on land that has planning permission, for example by assisting compulsory purchase on such land, and allowing councils to charge full council tax on unbuilt developments.It is also calling on the government to change the right to buy system, under which tenants can purchase local authority homes, by letting councils keep all the money from such sales to help them to replace them.David Renard, the leader of Swindon council and the LGA’s housing spokesman, said: “The planning system is not a barrier to housebuilding. The number of homes granted planning permission has far outpaced the number of homes being built.“No one can live in a planning permission, or a half-built house where work on a site has begun but not been completed. Councils need powers to tackle our housing backlog and step in where a site with planning permission lies dormant and housebuilding has stalled. If we are to solve our housing shortage, councils need to be able to get building again and resume their role as major builders of affordable homes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f1210c754b59469609be768d30b1ad6de1c0a9/0_139_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5468a23cc1ad9ceb64777684ca5c8939","title":"mclaren adopt strict safety policy on spread of coronavirus","story":"McLaren are adhering to a strict policy in an attempt to safeguard their personnel from the coronavirus. The team clarified their position after it emerged they are not allowing anyone who has visited China in the past 14 days to enter their motorhome during testing in Barcelona. It is understood no other team in the paddock has adopted the same policy.The Chinese Grand Prix has already been postponed because of the coronavirus and the threat is still being taken seriously at McLaren, who emailed a Chinese journalist who had just arrived in Europe and informed him he should not enter their motorhome.Zak Brown, the McLaren chief executive, said the safety of his team remained paramount. “We would never do anything that puts our people at risk and I don’t believe that F1 would,” he said.In a statement the team said: “Given the coronavirus outbreak and based on recent updates to UK government and World Health Organization directives, McLaren has issued a policy setting out restrictions and conditions we believe prudent to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our people, contractors and customers and protect our operations.“Among these measures is a precaution that anyone who has travelled from China in the last 14 days is not permitted to enter a McLaren operated building or facility for up to 14 days. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will revise our policy as circumstances change, while working with Formula 1 and the FIA.”The policy is in force at the team’s base in Woking and McLaren have taken steps to reroute staff who were travelling to the Australian Grand Prix through Hong Kong. Mercedes are understood to have made similar adjustments to their travel arrangements.Vietnam is to host its first race in Hanoi on 5 April and the situation there is being monitored.

Sixteen cases of the virus have been confirmed in Vietnam and last week the authorities placed 10,000 people in the Son Loi farming region under quarantine when six cases were reported there. The district is 25 miles from Hanoi.Lewis Hamilton began the season with a confident and quick run at the Circuit de Catalunya to continue the same form with which he closed out 2019.Hamilton’s teammate Valtteri Bottas was the fastest in the morning session as Mercedes laid down an early marker. Hamilton took to the track in the afternoon and completed a relentless 94 laps during which he set the fastest time of 1min 16.976sec. Bottas was second quickest, four-tenths behind. Sergio Pérez was third for Racing Point.Sebastian Vettel was expected to drive for Ferrari but was replaced by Charles Leclerc because the German was feeling unwell. Leclerc was 11th on the timesheets, while Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was fourth.With stable regulations this season evolution rather than revolution is the order of the day and Mercedes were expected to maintain the form that has secured the past six drivers’ and constructors’ championships. Nonetheless as a first outing to iron out kinks in the new car it was a textbook performance. With Bottas completing 78 laps in the morning the team put in a total of 167 laps, almost three times the distance of the Spanish Grand Prix.Williams made the start they desperately wanted having missed the opening two days of practice last year because their car was not ready. George Russell was the first driver out and completed 73 laps to finish sixth in the morning running.The 22-year-old Briton said: “The general handling is much better, last year the car was quite scary to drive in the opening laps. It was a character-building year last year but I am confident we can go racing this time and have a bit more fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56c579ca5372f73700c6e6d60a80395561e89260/0_0_1365_819/master/1365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811bd769f8fa59b9a898a9cfcdcc9699","title":"bono andy farrell ireland the edge england six nations","story":"Andy Farrell hopes he has found what he’s looking for. By inviting the U2 frontman Bono to speak to his players a few days before Ireland face England, and by bringing the former captain Paul O’Connell into camp for the week, Farrell’s message to his squad is clear. Identity matters. “Irishness” is something to be proud of and to be used to their advantage.If that sounds familiar it is because Eddie Jones, his opposite number on Sunday, has been trying to do the same thing with England since taking over in 2016. Indeed, he writes about it at length in his recently published autobiography and claims that, out of all the countries he was worked with, instilling an identity in his England team has been the hardest.His predecessor, Stuart Lancaster, tried with limited success too and it cannot be coincidence that Farrell has worked under both at Saracens and England respectively. But he is undaunted by their difficulties.It is a topic about which Farrell speaks eloquently and, listening to his players, they were evidently in thrall to Bono, who talked to the squad for an hour and 40 minutes. Suffice it to say that “Irishness” in this instance goes beyond Guinness-glugging or “smiling eyes” or whatever lazy stereotype rolled out in the past.• All times GMT all matches on BBC or ITVCJ Stander, one of the form players of the Six Nations so far, was born in South Africa but qualified for Ireland on residency. He is an example of a “project player” Ireland have been criticised for in the past but the idea of Irishness is not lost on the Munster forward. “It is not something you can put into words, or something you can define, it is not something you tap into, it is something that is in you,” he said. “I’m not saying it is in me but I have seen it over the years coming out of players and people. Bono said it is something that comes out when the going gets tough.”In Farrell’s eyes, the blueprint for how “Irishness” manifests itself on the pitch is Ireland’s 43-13 win against England in 2007. It was the first match between the two sides to played at Croke Park, the home of the GAA, and while Farrell ended up on the losing side it is a contest to which he frequently harks back. “I definitely felt a difference that day,” he said.Wins at Twickenham have been harder to come by for Ireland over the years but in 2018 they were resounding winners to clinch the third grand slam. Later that year Ireland beat New Zealand in Dublin, rounding off their annus mirabilis under Joe Schmidt before stagnating in the buildup to the World Cup. Indeed, they were on the receiving end of two thumpings by England in 2019 but Farrell has been taking steps to bring about a return to their 2018 form as they seek to claim the triple crown.Ireland players, having grown weary of the tight leash on which Schimdt kept them, have been only too happy to extol the virtues of the relaxed atmosphere under Farrell. Of course, had Jones had his way, Farrell would be working for him now, again writing in his book that in 2018 he sought to appoint him as defence coach after Paul Gustard’s departure. It was Jones’s call to get rid of Farrell when taking over England – one of the hardest decisions he has had to make – but at the time he felt the family soap opera with Owen Farrell at that stage not captain would be detrimental."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be0a3b685b932a2c940d627f1990b60045ab6df2/0_89_2313_1388/master/2313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08da6da68f7b60003cc382b8c307a3cd","title":"molly strano drafted into australias t20 world cup squad with tayla vlaeminck out","story":"Australia could throw a World Cup bolter into their biggest women’s match on home soil in history after Tayla Vlaeminck was ruled out on the eve of the competition.The Australians will open their campaign against India in what is likely to be a packed out Sydney Showground on Friday night, with unprecedented interest in the home tournament.Victorian spinner Molly Strano was on Thursday rushed into the squad after Vlaeminck was ruled out with stress fracture in her foot. The injury could have one of several implications for Australia.Teenager Annabel Sutherland could be thrust into the Australian’s’ first-choice side, after only making her debut in a tri-series against England and India earlier this month.At 18, she is generally regarded as the next quickest bowler in the squad alongside Ellyse Perry and could now figure as an extra pace-bowling allrounder in the tournament.“That is the bonus of the tri-series, we got to plan Annabel in a few of those games,” captain Meg Lanning said. “She looked pretty comfortable at that level with both bat and ball. She could potentially play a role for us.“We haven’t settled on a line up yet but it could potentially bring in another pace bowler for us. If Annabel was to play a little bit more of a role with the ball, I would certainly be very comfortable with that.”Strano herself could be an option to be parachuted straight into the XI. Jess Jonassen will play as first-choice spinner and other turning allrounders Erin Burns (knee) and Sophie Molineux (cork) are both expected to be available along with the fit Georgia Wareham.But Strano comes with her advantages. She has removed dangerous Indian opener Shafali Verma five times in seven games for Australia A and the Governor General’s XI this summer. The 27-year-old Strano, who played five T20 games for Australia in 2017, was also one of the form bowlers of the Women’s Big Bash League.“She’s definitely in contention to play tomorrow, as everyone is,” Lanning said. “She does have a good record against Verma. It’s something we will be thinking about. We will just have to have a good look at the wicket and decide what we think will be the best combination, and a lot of that will be down to match-ups.”Vlaeminck’s injury is almost one of the worst possible blows for Australia, given there is no other bowler in the country who can bowl at the speed she does. It comes as the Australians desperately want their most dynamic bat – Alyssa Healy – to return to form after she was player of the tournament in their 2018 success.“There’s no real like-for-like replacement for Tay, no one does what she does,” Lanning said. “It’s a massive loss and she is obviously pretty shattered with the timing of it. She was set for a big role for us. I’m pretty devastated for her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0864b8f170a5fb8570fd81b18098a94edd833829/92_402_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b9b4afdbe0121c4cb278c274798b4b1","title":"national theatre boss denies being part of left of centre elite","story":"Rufus Norris rebuffs Downton creator Julian Fellowes’ claim that NT is in a cultural bubbleRufus Norris, the director of the National Theatre, has taken aim at a suggestion he is in a “left-of-centre metropolitan” bubble as he announced he was to stay in post for another five yearsThe Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, a Tory peer, complained over the weekend of the people who “control everything – not just the BBC … but the National Theatre, the National Gallery, the National Trust, the national this, the national that”. He said they all spoke with one voice, “a kind of Hampstead voice”, which expressed opinions as facts.Norris rejected the criticism as he announced details of the theatre’s plans for 2020-21 on Wednesday.“I don’t know Julian and I’ve not seen him here recently,” Norris said. “I totally dispute the idea that we’re speaking in any particular bubble.”Norris said the NT’s work was increasingly nationwide, “more than the theatre has ever done. I expect that fact is not known to him because he hasn’t looked”.Fellowes made his comments in a Sunday Times interview in which he talked about the types of people resisting inevitable social change. Once it was the grand elite walking towards the abyss, now the “quite good” run “of the left-of-centre metropolitan elite” was coming to an end, he said.Norris’s run at the National Theatre is definitely not coming to an end, as he revealed he had recently signed up for a second five-year term in the job.He announced nine productions at its South Bank stages for 2020-21, which include an adaptation of Rachel Cusk’s trilogy of “Faye” novels, Outline, Transit and Kudos, and the first major revival in 35 years of the Welsh classsic The Corn is Green by Emlyn Williams.Standing at the Sky’s Edge, a musical celebration of life on Sheffield’s Park Hill estate with songs by Richard Hawley, which premiered at the city’s Crucible theatre last year, will come to the National’s Olivier stage in January 2021.New plays include Kerry Jackson by April de Angelis, set in a Hackney restaurant at the frontline of gentrification, and After Life by Jack Thorne, adapted from the Japanese film with characters between life and death who have to choose a memory they will live in for eternity.There will also be a “radical” new adaptation of Racine’s Phaedra by Simon Stone and starring Kristin Scott Thomas in her NT debut, and a new production of Pearl Cleage’s Blues for an Alabama Sky, starring Giles Terera, best known as Aaron Burr in Hamilton.He also denied reports of a rift between the theatre and its patron Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, saying there was “ongoing, very productive dialogue with the duchess and her team”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b82b967394bda72744fe1dce03778f0b3e1841/0_600_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eba05e3273c865b4465535e4b76f5966","title":"smart car gig rental app trapped","story":"I rented a car through the Gig app. But when I lost cellphone service, I found myself stuck by a remote highwayOn Saturday morning, I used an app on my phone to unlock a vehicle from Gig, a car sharing startup, and set off for a Valentine’s Day weekend trip to northern California with my partner.By late Sunday afternoon, we were sitting on the side of a remote highway, a software issue on our smart car rendering it unusable. It was getting dark, we had no way of getting home, and I was contemplating the limits of the sharing economy and the ultimate costs of convenience.Gig is a company that rents a fleet of hybrid Toyota Priuses and electric Chevrolet Bolts in the Bay Area and Sacramento to 65,000 users, according to a spokesman for the company. It is part of a growing field of car-sharing services – including Zipcar, the now-defunct Share Now, and recently Lyft – that allow users to rent standardized vehicles on the go. Other peer-to-peer car sharing companies such as Getaround and Turo allow users to rent their own cars to one another.The services make it incredibly convenient to hit the road – no paperwork or trips to the rental company required – but come with their own costs, as I learned this weekend.We had stopped the car for a quick hike down to the beach and when we returned found we could no longer use my phone to start the car. A customer service representative told us by phone the car’s software could not be remotely reset as it was out of cellular service range. It needed to be towed.“Does this happen often?” I asked the representative, incredulously. “On that highway, yes,” she replied. I later discovered this particular stretch of California State Route 1 no cell service for an approximately 40-mile radius.According to an email from Gig sent that afternoon – which I did not receive until much later – to offer customers the “best experience”, cars are re-synced automatically every 24 hours in other words, the car needs to update its connection to the cloud for security purposes. Without the ability to re-sync the car, customer service agents cannot remotely assist members, the company explained to me in a separate follow-up email.However, the car cannot be re-synced easily if it is more than 50 miles outside of the “HomeZone”, out of cell range, or if the vehicle is moving.A software engineer with experience in the field told me this was common with such technology: the longer the car goes without an update, the more vulnerable it becomes to security issues.“It works great if you have a dependable cell connection,” the engineer, who asked to be quoted anonymously because he works at a company similar to Gig, said.So we waited, and waited. I had enough cell service to send futile tweets about the saga but not to extricate myself from it. Eventually, Gig had us towed back to our Airbnb, where our wifi was useless in restarting the vehicle, which needed to be synced through the cellular network.We pleaded with Gig employees to send us a second tow truck and then pleaded with them to reset the car after they told us we had already reset it the maximum number of times that day. We had to explain to numerous American Automobile Association (AAA) representatives and one rural tow truck driver what a connected smart car is.Finally, five hours, two tow trucks, and more than 20 phone calls to Gig’s customer service line later, we got the car to start again. “Can I give you one more piece of advice?” the customer service representative said to us after the car finally turned back on. “Get the hell out of there – now.”Driving a smart car into rural California seems, in retrospect, ill-advised. But others have told me they experienced similar issues, even within the city limits of Oakland and San Francisco.Kate Wolffe, a reporter at KQED, said she had been stranded a few weeks ago at Redwood regional park in Oakland and walked for an hour and a half  to get a Lyft after abandoning the car. One Twitter user told me she and her friends got stranded in Muir Woods – about 16 miles outside of San Francisco – and pushed the car, in neutral, to an area with cell service. When that didn’t work, they abandoned the car and had Gig retrieve it later.This time last year, a Reddit poster shared a an experience similar to mine, in which his car stopped working when it lost cell service on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge. In September 2019, the Atlantic’s Annie Lowrey wrote about getting stranded by Zipcar in a similar fashion.In the aftermath of the saga, a customer service representative from Gig alerted me that users can order a radio frequency identification (RFID) card to lock or unlock the car in areas of poor cell service. Buried in the company’s website it suggests users order one, which takes two weeks to ship, before they “roam far” outside San Francisco. In the more than 40 times I have used Gig car since August 2019, I had never heard of the RFID card, and that precaution appears pages below the company’s promises to let users “sign up instantly” and “get going”.A spokesman from AAA, which is the parent company of Gig, apologized by email for the experience.“We are committed to improving our service and customer care, and will assess this situation for learnings,” a spokesman, Sergio Avila, said. “One immediate action is to improve communication to our Members about the important role that Gig Cards play in helping start a vehicle no matter where or when they need to use them before a trip even begins, so they are not dependent on cell service or Bluetooth alone. Our review of this Member experience is ongoing, and we will continue to identify ways to improve.“Our goal is to always have Members reach their destinations and we did not meet that expectation during your trip,” he said.Ultimately, I was refunded for the trip and given an $85 credit for my troubles I’m also being sent a Gig Card for long trips in the future. And when I walked outside this morning, the car I had gone through hours of trouble with was gone – someone else had checked it out and taken it on its way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876096927baa714a75ea5d2c27b0ec1a1bf97dd9/705_651_3358_2015/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4209cedcdc31f7972a745c046539bc","title":"samsung galaxy z flip review back to the folding flip phone future","story":"Revamp of 2000’s flip phone means big screen folds in half into a compact clamshell that fits in small pocketsIt’s not often something comes along to genuinely change the game, but the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip does just that, bringing foldable displays closer to the mainstream and reinventing the flip phone for 2020 in the process.Screens that fold in half finally arrived last year with the Galaxy Fold, which was originally plagued by durability issues causing a delay and a reworking of the device.The £1,300 Galaxy Z Flip is therefore Samsung’s crucial second bite at the cherry. And it’s a very impressive one at that.Instead of a tall smartphone opening out into a square tablet, the Galaxy Z Flip is a tall smartphone that folds in half like mid-2000s flip-phones. I won’t beat about the bush: folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Flip is a tremendous experience.The hinge opens and will hold the screen at any angle, similar to a laptop. It’s smooth and reassuringly solid. What you can’t easily do is flip it open with one finger, but you probably shouldn’t even if you could because the screen is fairly fragile – more on that later.Closed, the phone is a compact wedge shape with little rubber feet and magnets holding the two ends together. You’ll be able to fit it in most pockets, including the often useless-for-phones tiny pockets women are burdened with.There’s a small 1.1in oblong screen on the lid of the device adjacent to the main camera. It shows the time, the battery charge and a little notification dot if there’s something waiting for you. Double tap to light it up, swipe left for music controls and right for notification icons, which you can tap and see a little bit with scrolling text. It’s useful when you want it, but also easy to ignore, freeing you somewhat from the burden of notifications.Open it out and the 6.7in screen is remarkable. It looks and feels just like one of Samsung’s regular super-sized smartphones, which is a very good thing, apart from one caveat: there’s a crease in the middle. You can feel it, and get a reflection on the screen and you can see it.What feels weird at first under your thumb immediately becomes normal. It’s more visible when the screen is black, which makes the Galaxy Z Flip the first phone that looks worse in dark mode. You can’t see it while browsing a white web page or similar.The crease is one of the compromises of having a massive screen that rivals the very biggest smartphones available today, but that folds down into a small, pocketable package. I think it’s a worthy trade-off for now.The power button doubles as a fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, mounted below the volume buttons on the upper half of the phone.The screen works, looks great and the hinge feels sturdy. It’s rated for more than 200,000 folds, which is 100 openings a day for 5.5 years. It has nylon fibres in the hinge to literally sweep dust and dirt away as you open and close it, while the edges of the folding part have plastic T-shaped caps to try to block dirt from getting in that way.But there’s a massive question mark over the screen’s durability. It comes with care instructions wrapped around it in the box, including advice not to press hard on the screen with hard objects, such as your fingernail don’t fold something else in when closing the phone the phone isn’t dust or water resistant don’t put stickers or screen protectors on it and keep the phone away from credit cards as it has magnets in it. You can’t say you haven’t been warned.I was only given three working days to test the device and in that time it worked perfectly. Others haven’t been so lucky. Realistically you need at least several months of daily use to truly know if it will stand the test of time.Then there’s the scratch resistance of the glass screen: basically there isn’t any. It uses ultra-thin glass that can fold, which is remarkable, but it’s covered in a plastic layer and is so thin it’s easy to poke holes in. The screen is fairly well protected when closed, but it’s possible to get grit in between the two halves, while pushing hard with your fingernail could damage it.All in you have to treat it with the respect deserving of a £1,300 device, and even then you might run into trouble. If you’re at all blasé with the way you treat your smartphone, this isn’t for you.The Galaxy Z Flip has Qualcomm’s top-of-the-range chip from late 2019, the Snapdragon 855+, not this year’s top chip, the Snapdragon 865. It also has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which isn’t expandable with microSD.Performance all-round was good. Snappy, fast and smooth, similar to the Galaxy Note 10+, but not as rapid as the best, the OnePlus 7T Pro despite having the same chipset. If you’re into hardcore mobile gaming this isn’t the phone for you.Battery life was solid but not quite up to the standards set by the very best last year. The Galaxy Z Flip lasted about 27 hours between charges of medium to heavy usage.That was while using the phone as my primary device, lots of email, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 45 minutes of Netflix and about 10 photos.The Galaxy Z Flip has relatively slow 15W charging, taking close to two hours for a full charge, but has wireless charging and wireless powersharing to wirelessly charge something else from the phone’s back, such as a set of earbuds or a smartwatch.Samsung’s version of Android 10 is called One UI 2, which itself is an evolution of One UI launched on the Galaxy S10 last year.One UI 2 treats the phone’s screen differently to most other versions of Android. Broadly speaking the top half is for displaying information, while the bottom half is used for bits you have to touch and interact with. It’s a clever use of space helping you reach the bits you have to tap (with the exception of the notification bar), which is useful for a screen as long as the Galaxy Z Flip’s.As too are Android 10’s gestures: swipe up from the bottom for recently used apps, or across the bottom to switch the last used apps. Swipe in from either side for back. It’s simple, fast and easy to use on big-screen phones.Samsung has also made great strides in the speed of Android updates over recent years, bringing One UI 2 based on Android 10 as an update to the Galaxy S10 line in around three months from its release by Google.Overall, One UI 2 is a pleasing form of Android to use, with useful additions and, importantly, the full Google suite of apps and services, from which competitor Huawei is barred from using due to US trade sanctions.The Galaxy Z Flip has two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one normal and one ultra-wide, and one 10-megapixel selfie camera peeking through a small hole in the top of the screen.The rear cameras are good but not class leading. The main camera shoots excellent pictures in good lighting, deals relatively well with high-contrast scenes with the addition of an HDR mode, but starts to struggle in middling light conditions. Images shot in the foyer of a theatre suffered from a bit of grain and noise.Likewise, the camera doesn’t have the best low-light performance, although the automatic Night Mode helps. The ultrawide works great in good light, but the lack of a telephoto camera is disappointing.The selfie camera is reasonable, shooting detailed images in good lighting, but again struggles in middling light, unexpectedly producing some blurry pictures. I got better results closing the phone, double-pressing the power button to bring up the main camera, which shows a small preview in the cover display.Samsung’s camera app has a load of tricks. One of the most interesting is the “single take” mode. Press the shutter button and let it run until you think you have enough. The camera shoots photos, videos and produces gifs all at once, showing you a portfolio of content at the end from which you can pick and choose the best. If you’re not sure what will work best, this mode is for you.You can also prop the phone up by closing it part way and use either the selfie camera or the main camera, which works as a makeshift tripod producing some interesting results.Overall the Galaxy Z Flip is a fun camera to use, but won’t win any awards. It’s good enough, just not the best – but that’s not what you’re paying for here.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is a tantalising, desirable look at one possible future of the smartphone.A big phone that folds into a compact square is surprisingly pleasing to use, much easier to pocket and has the side benefit of adding a bit of distance between you and your phone. Unfolding it and unlocking it is much more of a deliberate act than it is to glance at a traditional flat phone, potentially helping you avoid notification overload.It looks great, makes you stand out and feels solid, like the premium, cutting-edge product that it is. It’s exciting, different and delightfully tactile. But only having had three working days with it, I just can’t tell you whether it’ll go the distance. Months of daily use is the only thing that will really test the Galaxy Z Flip’s durability.Buy the £1,300 Galaxy Z Flip if you want something different, but only if you can stomach the uncertainty surrounding its durability. You might get three years of problem-free use out of it, but then you might not. Only time will tell. But looking at the sea of boring metal and glass slabs, many of which are similar in price to the Galaxy Z Flip, I want one, and maybe you do too.Pros: a screen that folds in half, big screen made pocketable, stands on its own, good camera, day+ battery life, exciting and different, One UI 2, good gestures, wireless charging and powersharing, nano sim and esimCons: durability unknowns, no dust or water resistance, high cost, no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, no expandable storage This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Vodafone has said it will cost €200m (£169m) to comply across Europe, although in the UK it is already almost compliant.The government has committed to a total £200m investment in testbeds and trials across the UK to explore new ways 5G can be used, such as in farming, connectivity on trains, connecting rural communities, tourism and healthcare.“We’re determined to make the UK a world-leader in 5G and deliver on our promise to improve connections for people and businesses across the country,” said Oliver Dowden, the DCMS secretary. “This includes seeing how it could create new jobs in the countryside, make businesses more productive and unleash even more ideas in our cutting-edge creative industries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c371acf4c6b9486bdb2a62d3b0d936aeaaea9d33/441_0_1262_757/master/1262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b872b1f4efbce68d6b4a895c35172740","title":"10 best bars near europe main railway stations berlin paris brussels","story":"Weary, bleary, or just plain thirsty, travellers can rest easy at this cool and cosy collectionPlus enter our competition to win two first-class Interrail passesThe Amano Grand Central hotel’s Apartment Bar is by far the swishest in the area and just five minutes’ walk from Berlin Hauptbahnhof.

It was dressing-up day at Corfe Castle, the Dorset fortress knocked up by William the Conqueror 1,000 years ago, knocked down by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 and today the site of a royal battle for a throne nobody in their right minds would want.Both Pasquale and Harry Redknapp are kings of the jungle, each having won I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here. But which of them is the true king? Pretend you care. The matter could only be decided by the two reality show reciists mincing around in costume holding toy swords while tourists held up phones to record the moment for posterity. Imagine two cockney muppets wading through treacle while trading under-scripted boy bants and you’ll get the gist.I thought of Agincourt and of another Harry. Truly, there were gentlemen a-bed in England holding their manhoods cheap while these two made a mockery of medieval combat (Redknapp was wearing shorts and trainers throughout). Now we know what drove Meghan and Harry to the other side of the world. It wasn’t racism or press intrusion but the prospect of overseeing nonsense like this for the rest of their professional lives.Finally, though, while Pasquale was distracted by the state of his genitals, Redknapp swept in with his sword and delivered a blow to his adversary’s aforementioned crown jewels. The referee proclaimed Redknapp victor, though having ex-Millwall and Liverpool enforcer Neil “Razor” Ruddock officiate was the very definition of insanity.Harry Redknapp’s Sandbanks Summer (ITV) involves the 72-year-old ex-Hammers midfielder, former Spurs manager and brazen spokesman for some gambling website, yucking it up with mates at his home in the most expensive corner of Britain and going to nearby tourist attractions. My respects to the makers of this show for wringing half an hour of serviceable telly from this lame premise. We last saw Redknapp and his mates on telly a year ago in Harry’s Heroes: The Full English, in which Redknapp coached a team of overweight footballing has-beens – Ruddock and John Barnes among them – to slim down, shape up and then beat a team of Germans. Did his lardy lads stick it to the Boche? Frankly, I don’t know: I didn’t get to the end of the series. The same, I fear, will be true of Harry Redknapp’s Sandbanks Summer. In later episodes, Barnes and another genial footballing proselytiser for fleecing the vulnerable through gambling, namely Chris Kamara, will present their credentials. I haven’t got the strength.Here again Ruddock was the butt. “Pull up your pants, this isn’t Southend,” shouted Redknapp from the shore, as Ruddock paddled in the sea with Pasquale. Redknapp was on the touchline again, dispensing advice – only this time to keep Razor’s battered saveloy and mushy peas off Sandbanks’ genteel menu. The camera withdrew to a chaste long shot, so Razor’s builder’s cleavage was more suggestion than fact, though I suspect I won’t be the only one having nightmares about it.Harry and his mates found a penthouse flat on sale for £5m in Sandbanks, where real estate is more costly than Manhattan. Say what you want about Manhattan, but does it have a view of Poole Harbour or a Tesco ? Have its beaches earned a Blue Flag 32 years straight? Of course not. The only problem with this free publicity for the Dorset Tourist Board is that it may be too successful. This summer Sandbanks’ beaches will be packed thanks to this show. Just see if they aren’t.The estate agent, who needs to work on his sales patter, said this flat was “almost dead man’s shoes”. Very few properties come up for sale in Sandbanks because if you have one you hold on to it until you’re taken out feet first. It was like Location, Location, Location without Phil and Kirstie, which is a bonus – or watching somebody else’s staycation, which is not. If this is what Brexit Britain means holiday-wise, we have just made a terrible mistake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aab746631013ea089c11aa164b5e8a1c123bf27/0_23_2180_1309/master/2180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74a7d6dc17265d45b55a2bedc71d81e7","title":"democratic debate mike bloomberg las vegas nevada latest","story":"The top six Democratic presidential candidates faced off in Las Vegas on Wednesday in the most combative debate of the election and days before the high-stakes caucuses in Nevada. It was the first debate for Mike Bloomberg, and the former New York mayor’s rivals in the Democratic race for president immediately took aim – attacking him for his legacy on racist policing and reports of sexist comments and discrimination at his companies.In the first minutes of the debate, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders argued that Bloomberg’s legacy of stop-and-frisk made it impossible for him to broaden the Democratic party’s coalition and defeat Donald Trump.The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren compared Bloomberg to Trump in her opening remarks: “Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.”From there, the attacks didn’t let up. Bloomberg gave unpointed responses to a series of stop-and-frisk questions, saying he was “embarrassed” by the tactic deployed in New York while he was mayor: “I’ve apologized. I’ve asked for forgiveness. We stopped too many people.”He also claimed he “discovered” the city was conducting too many stops and that he reduced use of the policy. In reality, a court ordered the city to stop the practice, deeming it unconstitutional.According to Warren, that wasn’t enough. “You need a different apology,” she said.Warren also targeted Bloomberg over non-disclosure agreements several women at his company have signed while settling lawsuits. She repeatedly urged him to disclose how many NDAs women had signed and to let the women speak freely about their experiences. Bloomberg demurred and ultimately refused to answer her direct questions, leading to boos from the crowd.“In my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities,” Bloomberg responded.“I hope you heard what his defense was: ‘I’ve been nice to some women,” Warren shot back.The debate at the Paris Theater in Vegas came one week after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, setting the stage for a primary battle between the Vermont senator and the more moderate candidates. On the heels of a strong performance in the chaotic Iowa caucuses, former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg came in a close second in New Hampshire, where Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar’s unexpected surge won her third place, and Warren and Joe Biden both experienced disappointing results. Bloomberg is not competing in Nevada, but he had been climbing in polls after spending more on ads than any candidate in US political history. He also sat out the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries and had mostly been making his case to voters through TV ads and scripted public events up until Wednesday’s debate.  Buttigieg and Klobuchar, the more centrist candidates from the midwest, were looking on Wednesday to broaden their coalitions in states like Nevada that are significantly more erse than Iowa and New Hampshire.Buttigieg went after Sanders and Bloomberg, claiming that they were “the two most polarizing figures on this stage” and that he had broader appeal.But he clashed most fiercely with Klobuchar. Both midwestern candidates are competing in a crowded central lane, and tore each other down near the end of the debate. “You memorized a bunch of talking points,” Klobuchar said, telling the former mayor he has not been “in the arena”.Buttigieg responded: “I’m used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important. You don’t have to be in Washington to matter.”Earlier in the evening, Buttigieg had criticized Klobuchar, for forgetting the name of the president of Mexico, she responded: “Are you trying to say that I’m dumb? Are you mocking me here, Pete?”Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, also faced difficult questions over her criminal justice record and her recent inability to name the president of Mexico.  Biden’s campaign had deployed additional staff to Nevada, hoping the caucus will deliver some sort of comeback after his poor performance in the first two states led to a significant drop in his national poll numbers. The former vice-president went after Bloomberg with some energetic remarks, but faced renewed questions about his record from Warren and other candidates and generally failed to break through.With the long-shot candidate Andrew Yang out of the race, the debate once again featured an all white lineup.Inside the busy lobby of the Paris Theater on Wednesday afternoon, groups of Nevada voters had tried to get seats to the final debate before their polls. “This is the biggest election of our lifetime,” said Linda Gannon, a 49-year-old Vegas resident who showed up to the debate hoping to get a seat to see Buttigieg, her top choice. “I’m a bit worried about him in Nevada, but I think he’s got a shot. I feel confident any of the Democrats can beat Trump. We have to feel that way, and I will support any of them.”Lorraine Oliver, a 68-year-old public health nurse in line to get into the debate, said she recently got a chance to meet Warren in person and was sold.“She has such in-depth knowledge. But she’s not polling as well as I’d like. I need her to shoot up in the polls,” she said, adding: “I’m excited for an opportunity to get rid of Trump. He’s done enough to make people angry. We’re gonna fight back.”Also on line were several Andrew Yang fans who said they were continuing to advocate for their favorite candidate, even though he has already suspended his campaign.“It’s larger than him. It’s about his movement,” said Hannah Won, a 37-year-old arts advocate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6f73f84c7121a1b280ba2b93059433b44d1a3df/0_57_4428_2657/master/4428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d94909e5fa12141d2798d404fd431d44","title":"debate tonight live democratic news nevada bernie sanders mike bloomberg latest","story":"That’s all from me for tonight. Here’s how the night played out: Nathan Robinson says Mike Bloomberg was “ill-prepared, uncharismatic, and unlikable”. The other candidates ran rings around him. Elizabeth Warren sank her teeth in early, interrupting Bloomberg’s opening statement to point out how his long history of sexist comments about women made him a lot like Donald Trump. Warren landed even more brutal blows later in the debate, when she challenged Bloomberg to release women from the non-disclosure agreements his company had forced them to sign in sexual harassment lawsuits. Bloomberg mumbled some lame excuse about how the agreements were consensual, but was clearly caught off-guard, and Warren wouldn’t let the issue go.Bloomberg looked feeble, and after the debate some Democratic bigwigs were already reportedly concluding that “Bloomberg isn’t the answer.”Read the full comment piece here: Reflecting on tonight’s debate, Richard Wolffe says, “We have officially reached the Hunger Games stage of this Democratic primary season.”There’s a reason why the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday turned into such an epic Donnybrook. It’s called the primary calendar, which is inexorably counting down to the Super Tuesday contests in less than two weeks.At that point, one of the candidates on stage will emerge with a delegate lead that puts an end to all the quadrennial talk of a brokered convention. At this point, that candidate looks like Bernie Sanders.In the meantime, his five rivals on the debate stage have engaged in an entirely delusional sideshow of mutual annihilation.Read the full comment piece here:There were lots of disagreements on Wednesday’s debate stage in Las Vegas, but one thing that everyone seems to agree on is that the debate marked the most intense and combative one of the primary cycle. Bloomberg went after Sanders, Buttigieg went after Klobuchar, and Warren pretty much went after everyone.Here’s our early analysis ... Bloomberg under attack from the outsetBloomberg’s rivals challenged the former New York Mayor from the outset, critiquing his legacy on stop-and-frisk, reports of past sexist remarks, and the non-disclosure agreements several women at his company have signed while settling lawsuits.“Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another,” Warren said, comparing Bloomberg to Donald Trump.Having posted disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Warren needed a strong performance. She came out swinging, criticizing her rivals with well prepared remarks. Here’s how she ripped through the healthcare plans of her rivals earlier in tonight’s debate:She also landed one of the punchiest attacks on Bloomberg, bringing the attention to his history of derogatory remarks about women:Pete and Amy appeared out to destroy each otherBoth midwestern candidates are competing in a crowded central lane, and tore each other down near the end of the debate. “You memorized a bunch of talking points,” Klobuchar said, telling the former mayor he has not been “in the arena”.Buttigieg responded: “I’m used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important. You don’t have to be in Washington to matter.”Earlier in the evening, Buttigieg had criticized Klobuchar, for forgetting the name of the president of Mexico, she responded: “Are you trying to say that I’m dumb? Are you mocking me here, Pete?”Amid the attacks on Bloomberg and the rivalry between Buttigieg and Klobuchar, Sanders faced relatively little scrutiny. What a debate that was. Here’s how people have been responding to it online, with the battles between the candidates drawing particular attention (and in some cases delight): While Warren went in on Bloomberg, whose policies and record stand in sharp contrast to hers, she didn’t take on front-runner Bernie Sanders as much. Her surrogates brushed off questions as to why. “It’s about showing who can bring together that coalition,” said Allison Stevens, a DNC committeewoman from Nevada. Warren can bring “people who look like me and people who look like Nevada together,” she said, adding, “And I happen to be a millennial of color.”Though Sanders currently had the most support from young people and people of color, Stevens said Warren has shown she has the “fighting spirit” required to beat Donald Trump in the general election. Here are the final tallies for each candidate’s speaking time tonight, with Elizabeth Warren coming out top, followed closely by Amy Klobuchar:Julian Castro — who has been a surrogate for Elizabeth Warren since dropping out of the presidential race himself — said the Massachusetts senator had “won the debate, hands down.” “She showed why she’s the best person to take on Donald Trump,” Castro said, emphasizing Warren’s sparring with Mike Bloomberg. Bloomberg “was completely exposed and it was obvious the whole night,” Castro said. Democrats’ closing statements were marked by a dramatic intervention, when protesters erupted in the middle of Joe Biden’s final remarks.Looks like those protesters were immigrant rights activists, who lamented the lack of discussion around immigration during the debate. Here’s video of the moment. The immigrant rights group Raices claimed responsibility for the protest afterwards. Should billionaires exist? This is a question the candidates have been made to grapple with tonight. While Bernie Sanders, whose tweet last year inspired the question, is firmly on the side of getting rid of billionaires, he’s the only one onstage who supports the idea. But not all viewers are so against it:The debate is wrapping up, and candidates are making their closing arguments. As Amy Klobuchar put it, “This has been quite a debate.”Klobuchar: “I wish everyone was as perfect as you”. Defending her record, she said to Buttigieg, “You’ve memorized a bunch of talking points, and a bunch of things,” after listing off immigration reform legislation she’s worked on as senator. There doesn’t seem to be much love lost between the two moderate contenders tonight.

This included the location of sex work spaces in our city,” the council said.For instance: “If the location is too remote, there is a bigger safety risk and it becomes more difficult to supervise it. Also, it must be easily reachable via public transport.“Sex work is a normal job and the idea is not to chase prostitution from the city,” the council said.The erotic centre will not just cater to pleasures of the flesh but also house a beauty salon, a hair dresser and a tanning studio.The council said it hoped to finalise its plans before the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96cb964e74104543865f0c72ec48a1751aafe7e/0_360_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a26aed1669478dd7e03b6dcfa27a013","title":"coronavirus westerdam cruise ship stranded cambodia","story":"Travel options have been narrowed by a growing list of countries denying entry to passengers from the shipThe cheers of celebration have faded. The waving of roses has ceased. Having finally reached a friendly port willing to accept them after nearly two weeks of uncertainty at sea, hundreds of cruise ship passengers stranded in Cambodia by the new coronavirus outbreak are now simply trying to find a way home.“It’s a weird feeling to travel and go on a trip and you don’t know when you can come home,” said US citizen Lydia Miller, 55, who is camped out at a hotel in Phnom Penh, waiting to hear how she and her husband might be able to return home.The MS Westerdam arrived in Cambodia on 13 February, after repeatedly being denied entry to other ports. But the thrill of the moment, has now evaporated for those still facing a logistical nightmare.Travel options – already limited by the number of airlines serving Cambodia – have been narrowed by a growing list of countries denying entry to passengers from the ship.“We showed up in a city unexpected and there’s only so many flights a night and we have a lot of people we’re trying to funnel through that system and we’re putting a lot of stress on that system,” said Orlando Ashford, president of the Holland America Line, which operates the Westerdam.“It’s a math problem: wow many people do you have? How many seats do you have?”Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan are among those refusing to allow passengers in, making flying to Europe and the Americas difficult. Some airlines, such as Emirates, make a stop in Bangkok before proceeding to hubs such as Dubai, further limiting available flights.Still, Ashford expressed hope that remaining passengers would be on their way home “in a couple of days”.The Westerdam, with 2,257 passengers and crew aboard, began letting passengers off on Friday as they found flights home. But that was stopped once news broke that an 83-year-old American woman who had been on the ship and subsequently traveled to Malaysia was found to be carrying the virus. Some 255 passengers and 747 crew members were held on the ship while further testing was conducted.Cambodia’s ministry of health said on Wednesday that all the tests came back negative and that all passengers were reported to be healthy and fever-free. After that, remaining passengers were allowed off the ship.Tony Martin-Vegue, whose wife, Christina Kerby, remains in Phnom Penh, began immediately preparing for her return home to California’s Bay Area once she got off the ship. Now he’s not sure when that might happen.“It’s kind of limbo right now,” he said. “I’m worried about how she’s going to get home.”Kerby said “jubilation and relief” of reaching land has given way to the realization she doesn’t know when she’ll return home.“As the days go on I just feel like the probability of getting her home soon seems to be shrinking as the disease spreads and governments are continuing to react to it,” Martin-Vegue said.

The 77-metre cargo vessel’s odyssey came to an end during Storm Dennis last Sunday when it ran aground near Ballycotton, a fishing village in County Cork, Ireland, overlooking the Celtic Sea.Photographers gained access to the site on Wednesday, giving the first proper close-up look at a ship that has caught the public’s imagination. A local coastguard official called the landing a one in a million chance.For a derelict ruin it looked rather impressive: hulking steel, largely intact, with a navy blue hull offering a vivid contrast to grey skies and sea.A person claiming to represent the Alta’s owner has contacted Ireland’s revenue commissioners, who act as “receiver of wreck”, a statutory function. “An inidual purporting to represent the owner has made contact,” a spokesman said in a brief statement. He declined to elaborate.Built in 1976, the Alta was flagged in Tanzania, changed owner in 2017 and was sailing from Greece to Haiti in September 2018 when it become disabled about 1,380 miles (2,220km) south-east of Bermuda.Unable to make repairs, the 10-strong crew was rescued by the US coastguard cutter Confidence, which brought the crew members to Puerto Rico.The ship was reportedly towed to Guyana and then hijacked, with its subsequent fate unclear until August 2019 when a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, HMS Protector, encountered it in the mid-Atlantic, apparently unmanned.It is thought to have later drifted up from Africa and past Spain to Ireland, a solitary counterpoint to the cruise liners in Asia jammed with passengers facing quarantine because of the coronavirus.Marine contractors working for Cork county council boarded the freighter on Tuesday and carried out a preliminary examination of the ship and any pollution risk from potential fuel spillage.Not all fuel tanks were accessible but initial indications suggested they held only a small amount of diesel fuel.There is no cargo on board but some sealed containers with oil could pose a pollution risk in the event of spillage, the council said in a statement.The contractor was due to start pumping water from the vessel on Wednesday, and there are plans to remove the containers.The council expressed alarm at reports that members of the public had boarded the wreck, saying this was extremely perilous. “It is located on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and is in an unstable condition.”Ghost ships, mythical and real, are part of ocean lore. The Flying Dutchman, supposedly doomed never to make port, is a legend dating from the 1700s. The Mary Celeste was real, discovered adrift off the Azores in 1872, the crew’s fate a mystery.More recently, in 2006 the tanker Jian Seng was found off the coast of Queensland, Australia, without a crew, the identity of its owner and its origins unclear.In 2016 a wooden houseboat washed ashore on Ireland’s Atlantic coast. Made with driftwood and polystyrene and fitted with solar panels, it turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbd1d97dbe3566f43875d3999cc1615f15e210be/0_15_4806_2884/master/4806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7b71081a7cfd5177023aa0911af1719","title":"montreal canada pile up accident highway","story":"Nearly 70 people have been injured in a pile-up involving about 200 vehicles on a busy highway in a suburb of the Canadian city of Montreal.Two people were still trapped in their cars hours after the crash, which happened at 12.30pm on Wednesday in La Prairie, Quebec, said Sgt Marie-Michelle Moore with the Sûreté du Québec, the province’s police force and highway patrol authority.According to news reports, nearly 70 people were injured, some of them critically.

Sapra suffered losses of over $F500,000 (US$227,000).“The trees were stripped of all their leaves, a lot of heritage trees fell over, crops were almost completely wiped out,” says Sapra. “Unless it was underground it didn’t survive.”The majority of the production losses to Sapra’s 90-acre farm in Taveuni, the third-largest island in Fiji, were to his kava crop, a valuable cash crop which is fragile to strong winds. But Sapra also saw a drop in the numbers of native parrots, doves and bats which are instrumental for pollination.The damage to Sapra’s land, his family has been farming for nearly a century, was reflected across the country. Winston, which struck Fiji on 20 February 2016, was the most intense cyclone in the southern hemisphere. It killed 44 people in Fiji and resulted in huge losses for Fiji’s economy.But since the storm, Sapra has been rebuilding and re-planting differently and his methods may help the country’s agricultural sector mitigate damage from future – and increasing – cyclone events.Surveying the aftermath of Winston, Sapra noticed two key things that convinced him that there was a need to return to older farming practices.The first was in his kava fields.“In areas with tree cover, the kava was saved since the trees created natural windbreaks, branches that fell formed a protective blanket. But where there were no trees the crops were completely uprooted,” he said.The second observation was that down by the coast, most of the land had been eaten away by the strong waves that swept 30-50 feet inland, except the area held in place by the roots of a massive heritage tree that had been growing for more than 100 years.In the years before the cyclone struck, farming on Sapra’s estate was cleared of forests, which meant weeds and vines, naturally controlled by the shade of the trees, proliferated.“My grandfather began using herbicides to control the weeds, and as the soil quality began to worsen he implemented the use of chemical fertilisers to keep production at a steady rate. Gradually our soil began to disappear revealing mostly volcanic rock making planting more difficult and the land became more acidic.”Dr Sanjay Anand, a professor of soil science at the University of the South Pacific, says this practice of land-clearing has led to a loss of bioersity and increase in soil erosion, and is on the rise across Fiji.“As the population grows, so does the need for more food production, leading to more new areas being cleared for farming,” he said.On his regular hikes into the forest, Sapra observed the structure of the forest – where large trees, which provided shelter to fruit bats and birds, would shelter smaller plants.As he tried to rebuild and replant his farm in the wake of the cyclone, Sapra planted a variety of crops – intercropping kava with coffee, turmeric, ginger – in ways that mimicked the structure of nearby forests, underneath large trees to provide shelter. He has eschewed chemical fertilisers in favour of mulch and organic-based fertilisers such as those made from seaweed.Within a year of starting this project, Sapra began noticing renewed health of the soil and increased blooms and fruit production from his citrus, breadfruit and mango plants.His kava plants, which are planted among a mix of trees known for their nitrogen fixing properties, as well as others that act as windbreakers and provide shade, have a much lower incidence rate of “shot-hole” disease, which damages the health of the kava plant and is identifiable by several spots and holes in its heart shaped leaves.As maturing trees have shed their leaves, natural mulch is created, which feeds snails, centipedes and various fungi species. On re-planting heritage species, he saw a rise in the numbers of iconic and endemic birds, such as doves and red shining parrots and bats each year.“The ground is softer, easier to dig into, holds more moisture, and is a rich black colour. And with trees in place, the rich top soil does not wash away as easily in the rain,” he says.John Bennett, a prominent ethnobotanist in the Pacific region, says such an approach is ideal, but as prices for some crops soar – particularly kava, the root of which is ground up and mixed with water into a traditional psychoactive brew, which is starting to gain international appeal – it is difficult to persuade some farmers, especially those with limited leases, to prioritise soil health over profit.“Some farmers practice intercropping,” said Bennett. “But with increased mono-cropping of kava due to its increased value, many areas are being opened up to plant kava with little regard to sustainability”.After witnessing the positive results, farmers who work on Sapra’s farm have begun adopting similar practices on their lands.When Fiji was hit by Tino, a category-3 cyclone in January – the second cyclone to hit the country in less than a month – there was minimal damage to Sapra’s crops and soil, something he credits to the regenerative agriculture practices he has implemented.As experts warn that warming seas will result in more frequent cyclones across the Pacific, working to protect agricultural land is essential.Bennett says Sapra is on the right path. “Abhishek’s holistic approach is, without question, both appropriate, and, with our present climate anomalies, imperative.”For Sapra, his methods are equally motivated by philosophy and economy.“The main purpose is to create a working farm resilient to harsh climate, where people are able to make economical use of the land without degrading the environment,” said Sapra."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2db4b6adbd9a2a1891c884ca454cfce5843f73/0_243_6444_3866/master/6444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99a83f994afadce788a68c16661a5600","title":"the highway that determines the future for syria and its citizens","story":"900,000 have fled up the M5 in search of safety as Assad tries to regain last rebel strongholdIt was dawn when the Hussein family packed up to leave their home in Saraqeb. The whine of Russian and Syrian government warplanes had got too close for comfort in the last few days, and the thuds of bombs and artillery fire were scaring Odai al-Hussein’s 7-month-old son, Yahya.Odai and his wife Banan spent two weeks agonising over whether to leave home and take Syria’s M5 highway north, into the unknown. But in the end, the looming violence of Bashar al-Assad’s new campaign against Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in the country, led them to pack up the car. Hussein’s father cried as he bid farewell to his house.The family joined 900,000 others who have made their way up the highway in the largest displacement of people to date in Syria’s long war. For civilians who now have nowhere else to flee, the northbound M5 was the route to relative safety. Now totally under the control of Assad’s forces, the highway is instead the regime’s road to victory.The M5, or Syria’s “international road”, threads all of Syria’s major cities and six provinces together. The 450km (280 miles) artery joins the political capital Damascus to the economic centre of Aleppo. Stretching as far as Turkey in the north and the southern Jordanian border, which then linked Syria to the Gulf states, the M5 was essential for the movement of wheat and cotton, carrying an estimated $25m in goods and commodities every day before the war broke out in 2011.Recapturing the M5 has always been a high priority for Assad. Sections of the vital highway have been in the hands of opposition and jihadist fighters for the last eight years, but with Russia’s help, the Syrian government has slowly clawed back control since 2014, emptying towns and cities along the route via a series of blistering air campaigns and sieges.By the summer of 2018, Idlib, a rural farming province in the country’s northeast, was the only part of Syria out of Assad’s control. The population of the city of Idlib and the surrounding countryside’s population has swollen from 1 million to approximately 3 million as people afraid to wait for regime troops to arrive in their neighbourhoods have fled north in wave after wave of displacement.Even though the area was protected by a de-escalation deal brokered by Turkey – which backs some opposition groups – and Assad’s allies in Moscow, part of the M5 cuts through the Idlib countryside. And in December, Damascus launched a ferocious new campaign to recapture the last slivers of the road, finally taking the last rebel-controlled section around the village of Khan al-Assal last week.The regime victory has come at a high price for civilians. Bumper-to-bumper traffic has clogged the M5 and other roads leading north towards the closed Turkish border, those who can afford the fuel fleeing in cars, motorbikes and flatbed trucks, often taking no more than what they can carry.Even these escape routes have become hazardous options: sniper and artillery fire targeting civilian convoys has killed at least 15 people. So far, the regime campaign has killed more than 300 in bombings that have hit medical facilities, bakeries and other civilian infrastructure in the last three months. Footage has emerged on social media of regime troops allegedly desecrating graves in newly-retaken rebel towns.Regaining full control of the M5 is a major victory for Assad, according to Danny Makki, a Syrian analyst. “The highway’s recapture will inevitably galvanise the Assad government both economically and strategically, despite the losses they have suffered in men and equipment in their numerous attempts to secure it,” he said.“It also alleviates the logistical nightmare of supplying Aleppo and Syria’s embattled north, which has relied on reinforcements and supplies through dangerous and poorly-maintained alternatives.”The Syrian president himself made a rare televised address on Tuesday following the capture of the road, congratulating his troops and vowing to press ahead with the campaign.“This liberation does not mean the end of war and it does not mean… our enemies will surrender,” he said.“But it means that we rubbed their noses in the dirt as a prelude for complete victory and ahead of their defeat sooner or later. We should not rest, but continue to prepare for coming battles.”For the 3 million civilians cowering in Idlib, his words carry a terrifying weight. The situation is already desperate, with the UN and aid agencies warning the area could face “the worst humanitarian disaster of the century”. Turkish attempts to repel the regime advance with an influx of 12,000 troops have so far led to nothing.Aid response efforts are at breaking point. On Wednesday footage emerged on social media of displaced people tired of waiting ransacking an aid warehouse and grabbing what they can. Hundreds of thousands more are camped out in tents and other substandard accommodation on the Turkish border in freezing winter conditions, begging Turkish soldiers to open the border.Hussein counts himself and his family as lucky: they have managed to find an unfurnished apartment in Azaz, which is under Turkish control, although they are already longing to go home.“I heard that regime soldiers set fire to the houses of those who oppose the regime in Saraqeb and I saw pictures of soldiers looting. Our future is unclear,” Hussein said.“I don’t think I am afraid to die in the war, in bombing. But I know for certain I can never live alongside the men who fight for Assad – the animals who have done this to us.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178856.1582143494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"council to refuse applications for airbnb style short term dublin lets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFull-time use of houses and apartments in Dublin city for Airbnb-style rentals is set to be eliminated.

Of these eight were refused planning permission, two applications were declared invalid, three were withdrawn by the applicant and three are still awaiting decision by the council.In a report to be presented to councillors next week, the council said its policy is “to refuse planning permission for any development which would result in the loss of permanent residential units within designated rent pressure zones”.The policy effectively means no houses or apartments, that could be used as full-time rental homes, will be granted planning permission for short-term letting."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178788.1582138560!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"entry screening for coronavirus wouldn t work","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan says entry screening, as it is carried out in some jurisdictions, is not done in Ireland and  ‘would be a waste of resources’.  Photograph: Dave Meehan“Entry screening” for Covid-19 “doesn’t work, wouldn’t work” and would be a “waste of resources”, the chief medical officer has said.Dr Tony Holohan was speaking after it was reported that two Irish people who had been passengers on Westerdam, a cruise ship which is now quarantined, had returned to the country last weekend without being screened. While he would not be drawn on inidual cases, he said entry screening, as it is carried out in some jurisdictions, is not done in Ireland. Often this involves screening inbound passengers for high temperatures, but he said this would not be a good use of resources. “It doesn’t work it wouldn’t work it would be a waste of resources. And to test people who are asymptomatic is also something that wouldn’t be part of our protocols.”Speaking at the Department of Health on Wednesday, he said Ireland’s approach was to ask people coming from affected parts of the world to make contact with their GP or health authorities, and get advice as to what to do from there. Health authorities then identify a course of action deemed appropriate, which may involve testing or a period of self-isolation. Generally those without symptoms are not tested, he said.He said high-risk cases are being identified and tested, arising from the processes and protocols Ireland had put in place. “It’s not as if we’re not picking these up 78 people so far have been the subject of that assessment and have been put into those kind of arrangements where testing has been done, and that testing has turned out negative in each of the cases so far.”Self-isolationHe said the number of people who had been asked to place themselves in self-isolation was higher than the number of people who had been tested for the virus. This means, in all practical terms, avoiding contact with others, and some iniduals may be in a position not to work, he said. Dr Holohan said the public health service was examining a wide variety of information on potential contacts with people who may be high risk, for example on an airliner. “All that information is trapped and made available to the public health people and that provides them details in terms of contact training.”He said that contact with passengers on aircraft was a feature of nearly every suspected case or high-risk case that had occurred in the country, due to how people enter the State. Information about how long a person potentially infected was on a flight, as well as who was sitting close to them, is gathered from passenger manifests and analysed, he said, and people may be contacted depending on the result of this process.Dr Holohan also said he expects cases of coronavirus in Ireland, but has expressed confidence in the State’s capacity to handle the virus without it spreading among the population.Speaking at the Department of Health yesterday, Dr Holohan said “it’s not a certainty that a case won’t occur, we’ve been saying all along, we expect to see a case at some point, and it’s not going to change our public health management”. ‘No loopholes’He said there are “no loopholes” in the global, European or Irish approach to combating the spread of the virus, which emerged earlier this year in mainland China and has spread – albeit in smaller numbers – to dozens of other countries since then.“If a case were to get through, it wouldn’t mean that our system had failed. We’re expecting to see cases. What’s much more important from our point of view is can we be confident that even if we do get a case, we have a high likelihood of putting in place containment measures that prevent this case from passing on to other people in our community and become established in terms of community transition.“We have confidence about that, but not certainty,” he said.Dr Holohan was speaking after it was reported that two Irish people, who had been passengers on a cruise ship which is now quarantined, had returned to the country last weekend without being screened. Meanwhile, hundreds of passengers aboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, walked on dry land on Wednesday for the first time in two weeks.InfectedTwo Irish citizens who were on board the cruise ship had tested positive for the coronavirus and are being cared for at a military hospital in Tokyo having been transferred from the ship to the hospital on February 16th.They were among six Irish citizens on board the ship. About 500 passengers were expected to leave the ship by the end of Wednesday after an ordeal in which more than 540 of the 3,711 people on board were infected with the potentially fatal disease – the largest cluster outside China.Japan’s government says those released yesterday had fulfilled local quarantine requirements after testing negative for the virus.

Video: Irish Coast Guard\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Russian liner Lyubov Orlova: ‘Somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland.’The running aground of “ghost ship” MV Alta, on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork on Sunday, was not the first time such a derelict vessel has haunted our shores.In 2014 there were reports that the abandoned former Soviet cruise liner Lyubov Orlova was off the Irish coast bringing with it ominous headlines warning of “cannibal rats” aboard a “ghost ship” heading our way.The Irish Coast Guard on Tuesday said it suspects the liner has probably sunk but is “still vigilant” in relation to it. The 4,200-tonne ship was once the glittering choice of Soviet holidaymakers and later wealthy Russians touring the Artic and Antarctic.It is one of a number of ‘ghost ships’, unmanned but still afloat at last sighting, the whereabouts of which are now unknown.The 100m long Lyubov Orlova was seen adrift off the coast of Newfoundland in February 2013. The ship had been sold for scrap and taken under tow from St John’s, heading for the Dominican Republic. But less than a day into the journey the tow line broke and the ship drifted into international waters.As National Geographic put it in March 2014, “somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland”.Finding such a ship in the ocean is\u0026nbspnot easy. The International Maritime Organisation’s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires international ships, with 300 or more gross tonnage and all passenger ships, to carry beacons which function as automatic identification systems (AIS).Historical AIS data is also used for analysing the vessels movements on a global scale. In the case of the Lyubov Orlova, it would probably have its transponders off because power ran out. In addition, satellite recorders are not able to easily find a ship in the vast Atlantic unless they know a precise area in which to look.In its efforts to find the cruise ship the Irish Coast Guard combined AIS tracking with radar allowing it to “see” the ghosts . First, radar satellites scanned vast areas of the sea surface, where vessels showed up as blips as on a radar screen. These were then cross-referenced with AIS satellite maps, which showed the positions of all the active ships. In theory, the ghost ship would be the only radar blip not broadcasting a signal. During efforts to find the Russian cruiser an illegal fishing vessel near Scotland which had its transponder turned off\u0026nbspwas discovered.But all attempts to locate the MV Lyubov Orlova by the Irish Coast Guard proved unsuccessful.In 2016 another unmanned vessel washed up on Irish shores. In November of that year a makeshift solar-powered houseboat landed on a beach in Co Mayo after drifting across the Atlantic from Canada. Authorities said the owner of the 20ft timber and polystyrene boat was intending to sail on the “floating caravan”, but was talked out of it before it broke loose from its mooring in Newfoundland. It turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned.In December 2000 a Spanish boat, Zorro Zaurre, drifted 140 miles to the southwest Irish coast before foundering on rocks yards from where its sister ship, Nuestra Senora de Gardotza, sank 10 years earlier at Roancarrig lighthouse in Bantry Bay, Co Cork. The 13 crew members had been airlifted a month earlier after the vessel sprang a leak.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178867.1582144104!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il names team for formal government formation talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMicheál Martin: ‘This will not be an easy process, but it is a hugely important one.’ Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGettyFianna Fáil has said that government formation talks will move from informal contacts to a “more formal process of negotiation” ahead of the return of the Dáil on Thursday.Party leader Micheál Martin has announced his negotiating team for the talks, including deputy leader Dara Calleary, Anne Rabbitte, Michael McGrath, Barry Cowen, Darragh O’Brien and Thomas Byrne.“This will not be an easy process, but it is a hugely important one. We will approach the process in a positive, calm and constructive way, as we work to deliver a change of government and a new approach in the areas of housing, health, cost of living and climate change,” Mr Martin said.Sinn Féin held a series of meetings with smaller parties on Wednesday. Talks were held with the Green Party, Solidarity-People before Profit and Social Democrats as well as well as a number of independents.The party was questioned on its plans for forming a government and also on the costings in its manifesto.A source present at one of the meetings said the Sinn Féin negotiating team were still leaving the option of forming a government with Fianna Fáil open even though no talks between the two had happened yet.Fianna Fáil has consistently said it will not go into government with Sinn Féin.Funding questionsKerry TDs Michael and Danny Healy-Rae also met Sinn Féin and said there were questions about how the party planned to fund the promises contained in its manifesto.“A lot of the Sinn Féin policies, they sound fine, but it is who pays for it, where does the money come from. These are the very clear questions,” Michael Healy-Rae said.He said he wanted to know “how exactly it will be financed”, adding that “there is no such thing as a free lunch”.The Solidarity-People Before Profit group said it believed a left-led minority Government could work, and suggested it may not vote for Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald as taoiseach if she would not rule out working with Fianna Fáil.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said: “We sent the same message to Sinn Féin that we intend to send to the Social Democrats. We intend to pursue a left government to give effect to the demands for change that were clearly made by the electorate and to radically drive through the changes we need.”“They are keeping open the option of other arrangements that might include Fianna Fáil. For us, that it just not on. We certainly do not want our vote to be facilitating a return to power of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael,” he said.Taoiseach nominationsFianna Fáil will also nominate Micheál Martin for the position of taoiseach, Fine Gael will nominate Leo Varadkar and the Green Party will nominate Eamon Ryan. It is expected that none will have the adequate numbers to be successful on Thursday.Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty described discussions his party had on Wednesday with the secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach as “productive”. The party will meet the Social Democrats on Thursday morning. The Social Democrats say they are still deciding which way to vote in relation to a potential taoiseach.Labour is also expected to meet on Thursday morning to decide the same.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

File photograph: Alan BetsonMr Martin told a meeting of his parliamentary party, on the eve of the first sitting of the 33rd Dáil on Thursday, that it could be two months before a new government is formed.His comments come ahead of what is highly likely to be an unsuccessful vote by the Dáil for a new taoiseach at the first sitting of the House since the general election.Mr Martin, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan are all expected to put their names forward.None will come close to the required 80 Dáil votes to succeed, with tentative negotiations on forming a new government ongoing.Ms McDonald may attract the support of some left-wing TDs and left-leaning Independents as she continues with her efforts to form a Sinn Féin-led minority government. Her party’s negotiating team is continuing its meetings with Independents and others.The brief meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party in Leinster House on Wednesday evening also heard Mr Martin tell his TDs that substantive talks will get under way with the Green Party next week. The Greens will also meet Sinn Féin and others.He cautioned, however, that the process of forming a government would be lengthy and noted that numerous parties would need to hold special conferences to ratify any deal or programme for government that is agreed.“He said it could be April,” one TD present at the meeting said. Mr Martin did not, however, reference any talks with Fine Gael or any prospect of entering government with Mr Varadkar’s party.AllianceMr Varadkar this week said he wanted Fine Gael to go into opposition but did not rule out an alliance with Fianna Fáil. Senior Fine Gael figures claim the party will not engage seriously in such government formation talks unless another election must be avoided.Senior members of the party have privately speculated that the coming weeks could also see President Michael D Higgins refuse a request to dissolve the Dáil. Fine Gael sources say that sharing the office of taoiseach will be a minimum requirement of any so-called “grand coalition”, which would also need the co-operation of the Greens and others.Green Party figures, however, cautioned against being taken for granted and said the party rank and file could reject a coalition that sees it as the only political party with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Debate on the path ahead is also continuing in Fianna Fáil, with some TDs quietly questioning the wisdom of an alliance with Fine Gael, claiming it could significantly damage Fianna Fáil among working and lower middle-class voters.Some TDs also privately believe Mr Martin was too hasty in ruling out Sinn Féin, although most are strongly against working with Ms McDonald. Mr Martin has repeatedly ruled out working with Sinn Féin.The Dáil will also elect a ceann comhairle on Thursday by secret ballot. There are two candidates for the post: Kildare South Fianna Fáil TD Seán Ó Fearghaíl, who held the position in the last Dáil, and Independent Roscommon-Galway TD Denis Naughten.If Mr Ó Fearghaíl is elected, it will reduce Fianna Fáil’s number of TDs from 38 to 37.

Photograph: Áine McMahonPA WireDeep shock in Leinster House on Wednesday when news emerged that a government-formation meeting had taken place, and none of the participants were photographed walking up Kildare Street beforehand looking self-consciously determined and trying to suppress a smile.What sort of example was that to give the new TDs?It seems the Green Party and Sinn Féin met in the morning for a spot of Constructive Engagements. That’s probably the fault of the Greens, who organised a big group photo on the plinth on Tuesday, and think that’s enough for everyone. The party had nothing to add publicly to its unchanging stance on going into government, so nothing was said.Again, what sort of example is that for first-time TDs?The new intake was around for an orientation session in the Dáil chamber with Oireachtas staff. Important stuff, like who sits where and why, where and how to vote, what not to do in the chamber, how to create a scene and get thrown out for the benefit of the local papers and how to vote for yourself and a party colleague by pressing two different buttons at the one time. (The last two scenarios may not have been explored, but the newbies are, doubtless, aware of them).Normal service in the vicinity of the plinth was resumed after the earlier aberration when two members of the Sinn Féin negotiating team held a quick media briefing under the portico to discuss how the party’s serious commitment to exploring the “left alternative” was coming along.Pearse Doherty said the party was “intensifying” discussions with parties and Independents interested in forming “a government for change”.Watching intensely from around the corner were three TDs from SolidarityPeople Before Profit. Richard Boyd-Barrett, Paul Murphy and Mick Barry are three politicians who know their red lines. They issued them before the election and haven’t deviated since.Gazumped themIt’s really just the one line – any support they give to Sinn Féin is predicated on the non-return of either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to power. They had lined up a photo-opbriefing outside the gates of Leinster House before their pre-lunch meeting, but the Shinners gazumped them by holding a similar event inside the precincts at the same time.Afterwards Boyd-Barrett said the meeting went well, and he hoped Sinn Féin would choose the left alternative, but their negotiators told him “straight up” that they were keeping their options open.At lunchtime the Social Democrats let it be known that co-leaders Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall “would be available for pictures” on their way into talks with SolidarityPeople Before Profit. Yet before the appointed time the SolPBP Three belted out to the footpath before them for their own photo-op and press briefing.The Taoiseach shouldn’t put himself up for the job on Thursday, said Boyd-Barrett. If Leo Varadkar claimed he wanted the left to step up to power “let him stand aside... he should let the left move on and try and form that government”.But what if Sinn Féin decides to couple-up with one of the right-wing parties?“We’re appealing to them not to do that,” said Paul Murphy, as the two Social Democrats barrelled up Kildare Street for their photocall. But the Socialists had gazumped them, and the SocDems veered swiftly through a side gate.Next to arrive was a video crew from the  newspaper with Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin in tow. They conducted an interview on the plinth. Suddenly Danny Healy-Rae materialised and walked slowly past them. Then he walked back towards the door again to retrieve his brother Michael.MessingThe pair approached the microphones on Kildare Street, and held forth at length about what they expect for Kerry and for rural Ireland in the next government.Michael doesn’t want to see any of the messing he saw from the last administration or “any more ministers away with the fairies”.At 3.30pm a couple of big trucks came in and started unloading crush barriers in preparation for the influx of family and supporters of the new TDs when the business of cranking up the 33rd Dáil begins.On which subject, the final field for the job of ceann comhairle narrowed to a mere two candidates – outgoing chairman Seán Ó Fearghaíl and former communications minister, Independent TD Denis Naughten.The Healy-Raes were asked who the Rural Independents would be backing for the job.The popular Ó Fearghaíl, who is considered to have been an effective and innovative ceann comhairle, is the hot favourite around Leinster House to regain the position. If he does it will mean Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin will have the exact same number of votes at 37.Policy basisFinally, as another afternoon of landings and departures on the plinth was drawing to a close, the SocDems reappeared at the gates for their close-up. They had concluded the meeting with Sinn Féin, and would be having more meetings over the coming days, said Catherine Murphy.“We will continue to engage on a policy basis,” said Róisín.Neither are impressed with what they are hearing from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. No sign of any real policy change in a comprehensive way.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin’s group could be seen at the far end of the plinth, hovering beneath the portico again. When they returned inside through the main doors, which have been readjusted in time for the big influx, the button to open the sliding doors had been moved to the opposite side of the entrance.“You see, everything is left now!” chortled Doherty, on his way in after another day of photo-ops and meetings.And Fianna Fáil is keeping everyone waiting until teatime for the big story of Day 10 of formation talks – the announcement of the party’s Negotiation Steering Group.We’re that excited we’ve forgotten the names already.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Sean will also continue in his role as Minister for the Gaeltacht.”Mr Kyne (44) is understood to have been selected in part because he took the decision to support social housing in his home town of Moycullen, which was controversial locally.He also supported direct provision for asylum seekers in Oughterard.Appointing a new Senator will benefit Fine Gael in upcoming elections to the Upper House.Some 43 Senators are elected to five vocational panels by the 160 incoming TDs, the outgoing 60 Senators and city and county councillors, a total electorate of about 1,200 people.Having a new Senator in place to vote for the party’s candidates could make a difference to the chances of Fine Gael candidates when the Seanad election takes place next month.Mr Feighan was one of then taoiseach Enda Kenny’s 11 nominees in 2016, and was appointed without having to contest an election. Only these Senators can be replaced without an election being required.Party loyalists have been chosen for such appointments in the past, and the brief stint in the House comes with perks such as access for life to Leinster House, its car park and the Oireachtas members’ bar.Mr Kyne already enjoys such privileges, having been a TD. He was first elected to the Dáil in 2011 and held the seat in 2016. Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Francois WalschaertsAFP via Getty ImagesWhen Taoiseach Leo Varadkar hops on a plane on Thursday afternoon to attend a Brussels summit he will be flying from one intractable problem – government formation – into another which is perhaps even more difficult to resolve: the EU 2021-2027 budget talks deadlock. It has, if anything, more unpredictable moving parts, reflecting a chasm between those who pay in and those who are net beneficiaries. The negotiations have in the past been compared to three-dimensional chess. The leaders have been told to bring several shirts for the meeting, which is scheduled for a day, but expected to run for three or even four. Expectations of an agreement are low, with another summit soon already being discussed. The European Commission warns that failure to agree within the next couple of months will see spending authorisations run out on January 1st, and a drying up immediately of new EU programmes.The latest compromise proposal – “negotiating box” – from European Council president Charles Michel, who is charged with brokering a deal among the 27 member states, is for a spend of €1.094 trillion for the 2021-2027 period, representing an average increase in national contributions of 37 per cent over the seven years.For net contributors, such as Ireland, the increase is likely to be significantly larger, although the commission insists that 80 per cent of any increase is attributable to growth, inflation and Brexit. The latter leaves a €75 billion hole in the EU budget.Gross national income The central argument leaders face concerns the overall scale of the budget (the multiannual financial framework or MFF) for the next seven years as a share of the EU’s gross national income (GNI). At the conservative end of the spectrum of ambition are the big net contributor states of Germany, Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark, known as the “frugal four”, who insist on maintaining the current ceiling of 1 per cent of EU GNI. Although tiny compared to the 47 per cent of GNI member states spend on average domestically, every hundredth of a percentage point (roughly €10bn) is bitterly contested. The commission estimates the cost of the Michel budget at €280 per EU citizen per year.At the other end of the scale are MEPs – “always ready to spend other people’s money”, one diplomat says sourly – who want a spending ceiling of 1.3 per cent of GNI. The commission’s opening bid to cover agreed priorities is 1.14 . A proposal by the Finnish presidency before Christmas and a new compromise proposed by Michel splits the difference at 1.07.Net contributorIn 2018, Ireland, now a net contributor, paid a gross €2.5 billion into the EU, and the Department of Finance estimates that that would rise by 1 per cent under the “frugal four” proposal or 1.1 per cent under the Michel plan to €2.575 billion or €2.9 billion respectively in 2021. However, by two years later, by 2023, the respective figures would be €2.7 billion or €3.1 billion.Irish receipts from direct EU support were at €2 billion in 2019 – 80 per cent of this from the Common Agricultural Policy (Cap) , the rest mainly under regional funding and research headings. This is a controversial figure and a serious underestimation, according to the commission, which points to Ireland receiving a net benefit of €30 billion a year from its ability to trade freely across the single market. A senior EU official points out that by one measure Ireland is indeed a net contributor, by another a net beneficiary.The central challenge for Michel this weekend is reconciling the EU’s ambition to embrace new priorities, including a massive expansion on spending to combat climate change which is earmarked for 25 per cent of the new spend. Other new priorities include accommodating migrants, expanding common defence spending and riding the digital revolution, while traditional programmes such as Cap and structural funding, including cohesion funding, would be addressed at helping poorer states to catch up.New priorities are set to take up some 35 per cent of the budget, while the other two strands shrink below 30 per cent. Structural fundingMichel’s bilateral talks are said to have focused with the “cohesion” countries on undoing some of the squeeze on their aspirations to hold on to current levels of structural funding. He has done so by shifting some €6 billion of the proposed €323 billion of cohesion policy funds from the wealthier states to the poorer ones.In agriculture (€329bn), of particular concern to Ireland, he has reversed suggested cuts in direct payments by cutting rural development funding. But to sweeten the pill he is suggesting that member states should be freer to switch their funding from one pillar to another and would reduce the national co-payments they must come up with. Diplomatic sources suggest that he may have gone a considerable distance to provide the “cohesion” group of countries with the “wins” they need to sell a deal.Part of Michel’s wooing of the “frugal four”, who also have to demonstrate “wins” to their electorates, has been to promise that the controversial budget rebates they receive will be maintained as lump sum payments at a level yet to be negotiated. The rebates, largely the fruit of a mechanism devised for the British in their constant battles over the budget, would have been gradually dismantled by the commission. As a sweetener, however, for the net contributors, the Michel concession is unlikely to prove enough. New schemeMichel has also sought to placate Poland and Hungary who fear that a new “rule of law” mechanism to claw back cash from states abusing EU funds will be used to interfere in what they regard as domestic prerogatives. Michel has made the new scheme more difficult to trigger – instead of requiring an enhanced (qualified) majority to block measures, a qualified majority would be required to initiate the process.States such as Germany, which is determined to see enhanced accountability for EU funds, will be unhappy at what they see as a dangerous dilution of an important new principle. To help ease the burden on member states’ budgets the Michel proposed budget also includes provision for two new EU-wide forms of tax – a tax on non-recycled plastics, and a levy on profits from emissions trading schemes in the member states.

Photograph: Artyom IvanovIf only the United States was more bitterly ided along partisan lines. Oh, for some rancour in Washington.Before you check on this columnist’s health, compare the words of Republicans and Democrats at the Munich Security Conference last week. From defence secretary Mark Esper there was certainty about China’s threat to the West and Europe’s naivety in the face of it. From Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives: certainty about China’s threat to the West, and Europe’s naivety in the face of it.The US has entered an open-ended feud against the world’s largest nation with less debate than it musters for the pettiest domestic affairs. Its two great parties erge on the weapons of choice. They maul each other over the wisdom of tariffs and subsidies. On the basic rightness of the conflict, though, the lack of dissent will strike generations to come as eccentric (and, if things get out of hand, remiss).By now, Europeans and other third parties to the superpower tussle know that the US will not soften its line under a new president. What they tend to underrate is the chance that it will actually harden. For all his militant jingoism, President Donald Trump views China in practical terms. The more power, security and wealth that it accrues, the less he believes there is for the US. It is an impoverished idea of foreign relations but it is at least transactional.Stabilising influenceAs proof, the Chinese can and often do buy off some of his animus with material concessions. Trump’s quarrel is not a principled one with the essential nature of their government. In that sense, his cynicism, so unbecoming in other contexts, is a stabilising influence on this most fraught of relationships.It is idealism that has the far messier potential. Republicans were given to it until the rout of the neo-conservatives. It is now the Democrats whose grievances with China go well beyond economics to its civic and social model. One presidential contender, Bernie Sanders, views Beijing as part of an “authoritarian axis”.The lesson of its awesome rise – fears another, Elizabeth Warren – is that “economic gains legitimise oppression”. As for Huawei’s role in Europe, to let it build 5G networks would be “to choose autocracy over democracy”, says Pelosi, with the Manichean crudeness that nothing – not even the fiasco of Iraq, which it helped to beget – can kill off in Washington. Light and dark, good and bad, free and unfree: this stuff still trips off the tongue.The trouble is that it also widens the scope of the conflict beyond toy imports and intellectual property law. It implies that, in the absence of a round of glasnost, there is not much China can do to answer US concerns. Its very system is the problem.MoralisingThe Democrats will not fret quite as much as Trump about the bilateral trade deficit, and for this nod to Ricardian logic we must be thankful. But they seem more likely to define the US against the Chinese way of life: to moralise what is for now a largely material conflict. No doubt, it will be meant well. But then no one “had better motives for all the trouble he caused” than Pyle, the erring innocent in Graham Greene’s novel The Quiet American.An odd thought, I know, that a bellicose president, the one who began the US-China schism in the first place, might be better at containing it than his higher-minded successors. But the Cold War also metastasised beyond the plans of those (including the diplomat George Kennan) who never envisaged a worldwide clash of “values”.Trump’s indifference to the domestic doings of China, Saudi Arabia and other governments has shown his narrowness of human sympathy. But it has also kept his squabbles with most of them to what is tangible and negotiable. It is not even as though he drives the hardest of bargains, as the North Koreans might testify between Cheshire Cat smiles.Perhaps the Democrats’ more ideological noises will turn out to be so much electioneering. Neatly, their line on China allows them to match Trump for vigilance without forfeiting their distinctiveness. It is just that Washington’s vein of idealism is too persistent and too chequered in its record to be dismissed as easily as that.A new president would need staff and these would come from a diplomatic firmament that hews to much of what the Democrats are saying. The same belief in America as an “idea”. The same wariness of China as the opposite of it. And the same affront that nations from Britain to the Philippines, without a market of $21 trillion to fall back on, do not see things with such piercing clarity. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: Unlike bamboozled pundits, the public completely gets the Cummings ProjectGermany shooting: Suspect found dead after 10 people killed in attack on shisha bars in Hanau - latest newsMichael Bloomberg savaged by rivals in Democratic debateCoronavirus latest news: Britons await Friday evacuation flight as two cruise ship passengers dieTwo passengers die after contracting coronavirus on Diamond Princess cruise in JapanCoronavirus: Surge in South Korea virus cases linked to church ‘super-spreader’Hanau shooting: Suspect found dead after 10 killed at shisha bars in GermanyPriti Patel denies claims she tried to oust her top civil servantCrossfire: The untold story of Britain\u0026#39s role in the Trump-Russia scandalGovernment funding could reduce the number of potholes by 25 per centRobin Hood to walk Sherwood Forest again as part of Government-funded 5G schemeStudents can be naive over climate change, new environment advisor at St Andrews University saysCoronavirus latest news: British passengers left in limbo over Diamond Princess evacuationMeghan and Harry sign off as door left ajar for DukeMore women than men pen National Theatre plays after gender target setOxford could remove Homer and Virgil from compulsory Classics syllabus amid ersity driveTerrorists kept in jail could face worse influences than if released, warns watchdogComment: This sensible response to the demand for migration control deserves our supportEd Miliband lined up by allies of Sir Keir Starmer for return to Labour frontbenchWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"life has much smoother since adopted posh accent","story":"\u0026#39Watching 1970s hit Upstairs Downstairs convinced me to ditch my regional accent when I was seven\u0026#39Staying loyal to your regional dialect is not a social mobility springboard, it’s a trapI haven’t once regretted ditching my London Irish accent at the age of seven in favour of the stagey Received Pronunciation mimicked from Upstairs, Downstairs. Having honed and maintained my “posh” pronunciation for decades, I’m afraid I have to turn a deaf ear to poet Ian McMillan’s plea this week for more Northern newsreaders on TV.It is true that the BBC has been turning down the volume on plummy accents of late. Presenter Chris Mason, who claimed last year that his Yorkshire voice had helped him get the job presenting Radio 4’s Any Questions, has lamented the prospect of others having to change their accents. Yet I found that the decision to alter mine was totally liberating. Life is unquestionably smoother if you are well spoken. Just because you happen to have been born on the banks of the Humber or within the sound of Bow Bells doesn’t mean you have to be lumbered with the accompanying dialect for the rest of your life.Had I not learnt to enunciate my aitches and dropped the long, flat vowels of my early years, I’m certain I would not today score the “Yes, we can possibly squeeze you in” medical appointments, the no-questions-asked shop refunds, and the “Let’s talk at my club” work conversations.This is not fair. But neither, for my working-class parents, are the narrowed eyes and hunched shoulders they are greeted with upon every encounter with authority or any request for service. Upstairs, Downstairs may have been fiction, but the on-screen world in which Miss Hazel could command “tea in the drawing room” while colloquially voiced characters scrubbed copper pots down below reflected my early childhood with uncanny accuracy. Even to a seven‑year-old, opting for an upstairs accent seemed like a no-brainer. Margaret Thatcher downplayed her Lincolnshire accentBarrister and social mobility campaigner Hashi Mohamed, author of People Like Us: What It Takes to Make It in Modern Britain, advises young people wishing to transcend their background to adopt a professional accent for work, even if they want to retain a more down-to-earth register for family and friends. He is right. Tying people to their dialect of origin is not a social mobility springboard but a trap.Of course, adopting a new accent is a bit like owning a really good fake painting: the clues are always there if an expert gets close enough. The west London place names I learnt as a small child are my Achilles’ heel: it is still an effort to prevent the likes of ’Arlesden, ’Ammersmith and Notting ’Ill from slipping out. And, as the late Margaret Thatcher’s slightly strangled tones testified, it is the strong emotions that are harder to express in a voice that is not 100 per cent your own. Still, the only people who generally rumble me are foreigners who attended English drama schools. They recognise the subtle difference between effortless RP and a carefully constructed replica because they had to learn to do exactly the same for costume drama auditions.Even if the ownership of a Peggy Mitchell-twang were to swing into fashion, when you’ve faked it for as long as I have, there is no turning back. This polished accent of mine is the nearest thing I have to a true voice. Just do please refrain from asking for directions if you spot me in west London, just in case.

No, it’s not making sexist statements or proselytising for the Church of Scientology that will result in you being called in to your manager’s office these days: if you work for property developer Igloo, or office space behemoth WeWork, it’s trying to claim a bacon sandwich on expenses.Yes, if you’re on their payroll, you\u0027ll be better off financially being vegetarian on your lunch breaks. And don’t even think about ordering a pepperoni pizza during an away day: all company events are strictly veggie.But what right do these companies have to insist their employees can’t eat meat? Well, now you’re asking. After all, not only is it illegal to insist their employees do eat meat, but a recent court ruling decreed that ‘ethical veganism’ is a legally protected belief on a par with religion or sexuality. That ruling was the first part of a case currently being brought by a man who claims he was sacked from The League Against Cruel Sports (not a group known for its conservative viewpoint) for his veganism. But if veganism is legally protected, shouldn’t meat-eating be? Both are personal ethical choices regarding food that are in no way imposed on others (we are, after all, talking about people out of the office on their lunch break). Indeed, since it’s generally healthier for an inidual to have some meat in the diet, banning it actually runs the risk of imposing poor health on some workers.Say George from accounts fancies losing a few pounds on the Atkins diet, he’s going to find it a damn sight harder if he can’t have chicken for lunch. Or if Laura from acquisitions is a little anaemic during her pregnancy she can eat out with her colleagues during an office away day, but if she has a steak then she has to pay for her food, while everyone else gets it provided. Yes, it’s back to the stretchy trousers for George and counting out the pennies for Laura while the vegetarians head back to the office sated and pecunious.WeWork won\u0026#39t let staff expense meals containing meat or serve it at the events it fundsFor a quick morality-check, let’s try the old ‘shoe-on-the-other-foot’ game: WeWork’s new board of directors decides vegetarians must eat meat when meeting clients. They have to stuff down the sausages and gobble up the goose. And they have to like it. Of course, we can guess the first lawsuit will arrive within 24 hours. Few will blame them.And yet it’s not at all tricky to get these things right and fair. After the court ruling that ethical veganism is a protected belief, the Vegan Society issued a stonkingly reasonable set of guidelines for employers: a separate shelf in the fridge for vegan food, no insistence that vegans attend hog roasts, almond milk in the office kitchen. Apart from the eyebrow-raising claim that jokes made in the vicinity of vegans could constitute harassment and should be stamped out, it’s a list any decent employer could get on board with. That’s because it doesn’t impose on others - it doesn’t insist, on pain of dismissal, that non-vegans give up Cheddar and leather shoes for eight hours per day. No, good employers make workplaces inclusive, not exclusive respectful, not sneering and sanctimonious. So, when a firm says that the majority of the population are not worthy of taking home the same money at the end of the month as vegetarians, that those employees are literally worth less because they like to eat meat, it’s time to throw back in their faces their claims of inclusion and ethical employment. That’s the meat of the matter.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It is tricky but not impossible,” he said.  “Virgil uses poetic language, it is harder than standard Latin prose like Cicero or Caesar. But students who are working hard can quickly get their head around it. If you ask the students, they love it.” He said that fellow Classics dons have argued that students who arrive at Oxford without Latin and Ancient Greek A-levels “struggle” with Homer and Virgil.“They rationalise it by saying if Homer and Virgil are compulsory that is somehow giving an edge to private and grammar school students who took the A-levels,” the source continued.  “But there are plenty of students who pick up the languages when they get here and get very good marks. And there are lots of posh boys from Eton who arrive with the A-levels and still get really bad marks.”  He said it would be a “great shame” if Homer and Virgil were moved to Greats and became optional, meaning that “students could easily pass through the degree never reading them”.   The subject - also known as Literae Humaniores - has been studied at Oxford for over 900 years and its alumni include Oscar Wilde, C. S. Lewis and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.    Of students who were awarded a first in their Mods last year, 94 per cent had taken A-levels in Latin or Ancient Greek or both. Only two students (six per cent of the year group) who arrived at Oxford without ancient languages achieved the top grade.Dr Daisy Dunn, a historian and author who read Classics at Oxford, said that axing Homer and Virgil from Mods is “a terrible idea” adding that it is like “cutting the Bible from Theology”.She said: “I can\u0027t believe it, it just seems astonishing.  Homer and Virgil provide the foundation texts of classical antiquity.“And if you haven’t got a close working knowledge of the epics you will be at a disadvantage. To deprive students who come up with no Greek of the chance to read Homer for Mods seems grossly unfair.”The proposals to remove Homer and Virgil were discussed at a faculty meeting earlier this term and a survey has been sent out to academics to garner opinion on the plans.   It is the latest in a string of overtures that the faculty has made to address gap in achievement between different groups of students.  Last year, it emerged that the faculty planned to overhaul the degree in a bid to boost the number of female students getting top grades. Classics dons who marked exam papers in 2018 said the gender gap was “very troubling”, adding that it must be addressed as a matter of urgency.Dr Pitcher, chair of the Classics Faculty, said last year that a working group has been set up to recast the syllabus as a way to “address the gender disparity”.A university spokesman said the Classics faculty is currently consulting staff on the changes and that “no final decision has been made”.There are now fewer Classics students who arrive at Oxford with A-levels in Latin and Ancient Greek, the university said, adding that the faculty monitors these changes and keeps the course under review to keep it equally stimulating and engaging for all students.\u0027\u0027 The spokesman said that the Faculty is reviewing the first two years of the Classics degree and as part of this we are considering the question of whether Homer and Virgil are best studied in the first part of the course or the second. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn

If we don’t create standards that people feel are legitimate, they won’t trust institutions or technology.“To be clear, this isn’t about passing off responsibility. Facebook is not waiting for regulation we’re continuing to make progress on these issues ourselves.“But I believe clearer rules would be better for everyone. The internet is a powerful force for social and economic empowerment. Regulation that protects people and supports innovation can ensure it stays that way.”The social network said it wanted its recommendations to spark further debate about the issue of online regulation, and confirmed it planned to publish more papers on the subject of elections and privacy later this year.“If designed well, new frameworks for regulating harmful content can contribute to the internet’s continued success by articulating clear ways for government, companies\u0026nbspand civil society to share responsibilities and work together,” Facebook’s vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said.“Designed poorly, these efforts risk unintended consequences that might make people less safe online, stifle expression and slow innovation.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That algorithm has remained largely mysterious and for many frustrating, since there is no way of knowing how it decides which to show at the top.Now the company appears to be testing out a new feature that would allow people to decide only to see the posts that have been sent most recently.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe feature – which has not rolled out to the main app – allows people to click for Most Recent as well as an Already Seen feed that would allow them to see things from the past.The feature was found by researcher Jane Manchung Wong, who has found a variety of unreleased features inside of Facebook apps.If it arrives, the feature will presumably make the Facebook feed a tabbed experience rather than being presented only with one feed of various posts. The company has in the past tested other tabs, including one limited to particular kinds of posts.In 2013, the company announced that it was planning a variety of different tabs that would allow people to see a feed of posts only from close friends or those with music, for instance. It was dropped soon after and there is no trace of it in the app today.Facebook proposes ‘rules for the internet’ as it calls for regulationA Facebook spokesperson said the new update was only available inside of Facebook for now, but that it was considering testing it externally.You can already view your Facebook News Feed chronologically, a Facebook spokesperson said on Twitter.\u0026nbspThe screenshot below is how we’re testing ways to make it easier to find, as well as sort by, posts you’ve already seen.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the problems with coronavirus and the related issues, the company is said to be still on track with the phone.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the new report suggests that the spread of the virus could hit supply, leading to constrained availability for those trying to buy the phone.Though the company is on schedule for the launch it is likely to miss the schedule for mass producing the cheaper phone, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.The company had asked suppliers to make 15 million of the phones ready for the first half of the year, the outlet previous reported. Mass production was meant to start at the end of February but is now likely not to begin until March, it said.Apple’s new cheaper phone \u0027to arrive soon\u0027 despite coronavirusThe claim came soon after Apple warned that it was likely to miss its sales forecasts because of the disease outbreak.The spread of the disease in China – which is a major market for both buying and making Apple products – has led to a variety of issues for the company, including closed stores and slower than usual manufacturing.When the original iPhone SE was released, in March 2016, it was also difficult to buy amid constrained supply.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

May Bulman talks to those kicked out of Britain about the difficulty of\u0026nbspstarting againImagine being ripped from everyone and everything in your life, locked in a cell, then flown across the globe to a country you barely know. You have no friends or family there, no job, and sometimes struggle to even be understood by the locals. This is your new life.That’s the situation facing some of those flown to Jamaica on a controversial charter flight this month, many of whom – though they remain Jamaican nationals – had lived in Britain since they were children. One told The Independent he had only a single\u0026nbspmemory of the Caribbean island:\u0026nbspbrushing his teeth as a small child.The mass deportation, which had intended to return around 50 people before the courts limited the number to 17, has shone a light on human suffering caused by Britain’s returns system, which sees thousands deported each year, often with limited access to legal help to defend their right to stay in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne man struggling to build a life after deportation is Tremayne Brown, 26, who was on a charter flight to Jamaica in 2017. He had lived in Britain since the age of six, having moved from Kingston’s Rose Town to south London with his father after his mother, brother and sister were killed by gangs. His father went to prison soon after their arrival – and was later deported – meaning Tremayne was put into care. No attempts were made to regularise his status in the UK.“I was leaving care and I was meant to get my own place and find a job, but then my social worker told me I wasn’t allowed to work, and they weren’t able to give me somewhere to live either, because of my status,” says Tremayne. “I was suddenly classed as an illegal alien.”Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But he was not allowed to work. His girlfriend and their baby son needed financial support, so he was pushed into crime.“I was stuck in a place where I wasn’t allowed to work and I couldn’t get anywhere to live. What am I meant to do? I regret it every day. If I didn’t do that, I would be there with my son right now.”Aged 18, Tremayne was convicted for supplying class A drugs and commercial robbery, serving three years in jail. He did his time, then was transferred to a removal centre and issued deportation orders. He says that on entering detention he was told his removal had been cancelled, so did not contact his solicitor. But a week later, he was put on a flight.“One night they came to my door and said, ‘Pack your bags.’ When I was on the plane I called the solicitor and he said, ‘Why didn’t you ring me, I could have cancelled your ticket,’ but that it was too late. I never got the opportunity to fight my case.”A young man who grew up in the hands of the British state was now being flown to a country he had not set foot in for nearly 20 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though he lives with his father, Tremayne yearns to see his loved ones in Britain, particularly his son who, now aged six, has spent the majority of his life without his dad, having to make do with video calls.“He always asks me, ‘Dad, where are you?’ And if I’m coming back and why I left. It’s hard to explain it to him. He might hear his father’s voice and see him, but in reality you want him there in front of you. Through his childhood I haven’t been there. I haven’t been able to take him to the park. Those little things are important and have a knock-on effect on him as a child, having to grow up and say, ‘My father wasn’t there.’ It will make him bitter.”The Uncertain Kingdom - the groundbreaking anthology of twenty short films is released in cinemas 3\u0026nbspApril.\u0026nbspTremayne struggled to find work, largely because of his reputation as being one of the “deportee boys” who had their chance and lost it. His qualifications were not recognised in Jamaica, but he found a job at a holding company. He says the stigma still weighs on his shoulders. His British accent means he is constantly asked where he comes from and why he was deported.“I have had to start again from scratch. You spend your whole life in one place and then you have to adapt yourself again. Nothing is easy, but you have to try,” he says. “Some days are really hard. I miss my son, I miss my foster mum, I miss the scenery. Having been a young boy and grown up there, I class myself as British. Everything I know is from Britain. I never learned anything from Jamaica.”Another deportee, Chevon Brown, was forcibly removed on a charter flight last February on the basis of a driving offence he committed aged 21 – something he describes as a “stupid mistake”. He had moved to the UK when he was 14 and has no close relatives in Jamaica.As a qualified barber who started working at the age of 16, the 24-year-old had hoped to find a job fairly easily. But he says his name has been tarnished by the insinuation by British politicians that everyone on the charter plane was a murderer, rapist or drug dealer.Chevon rarely leaves the house because he says he can feel animosity from people in the street, and he has sleepless nights worrying about his future.“I’ve asked for jobs, told them I’m qualified, but after they’ve heard my name, they don’t want to employ me. They say how can they trust me when I’ve been deported,” he tells The Independent. “People think we’re going to come here and cause major crimes. Most people think I’m a murderer, rapist or drug trafficker, which I’m not. I went to prison for dangerous driving and I completely regret it because I never knew I’d be serving double punishment for one stupid mistake.”The proof that ministers haven’t learnt the lessons from WindrushChevon, who grew up in Oxford, served seven months after admitting speeding in an uninsured car. It happened after a heated argument with his housemate, when he took the car out and drove away from police.“I knew what I was doing was wrong in the moment,” he says. “I was genuinely scared. I wish I had stopped, given them the key, got arrested and that be that. I had no idea that this would be the aftermath of driving away from the police. If I ever come back to England I don’t want any involvement with police. I just want to live a calm and peaceful life. I want to get a barbershop, get a mortgage on a house, start planning a future, get a car, all those things.“But right now, I’m paying two, three years after the actual thing. I’ve gone to jail, done my time, and years later I still can’t actually move on with my life. I feel like I’m still in prison. It’s worse than prison, because I can’t see my family and friends. I feel like I’m stuck. My whole reputation has been messed up by one silly mistake.”“My dad is getting more and more stressed. He’s got health problems. My 18-year-old brother’s not listening to anyone any more. There’s been a ripple effect from what’s happened to me. My little brother keeps asking me, ‘When are you coming home?’ I can’t give him a definite answer about that. I wanted to set a good example. But right now I feel like I’m actually being a weight on my family, because of all this negative attention that’s been drawn towards me.“I feel more British than Jamaican. My dad brought me to England and said this was where I was going to be living for the rest of my life. So I ed into the new society and this is who I am today. Most people try to tell me to speak Patois, but I feel comfortable speaking English. When I speak the Jamaican language I feel like I have to put it on. I don’t want to put it on.”The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connectionsWhile charter flights to Jamaica have garnered media attention in the wake of the Windrush scandal, forced deportations from the UK take place throughout the year to countries across the globe, with 9,461 people removed in 2018 and 12,049 the year before – in addition to around 20,000 iniduals removed through the voluntary returns route. An estimated 2,000 of those forcibly removed are put on planes privately chartered by the Home Office, of which a total of 20 charter planes left Britain last year, with the destinations including Albania, Pakistan, Nigeria, France and Ghana.Kweku Adoboli, 39, was deported to Ghana in 2018 after having lived in Britain since the age of 12. In a highly publicised court case, he had been sentenced to seven years behind bars in 2012 after losing £1.4bn while working for Swiss bank UBS. The banker, who had a British partner at the time, was sentenced to five years in jail. Two days after he was convicted, he was informed that he was liable to automatic deportation.“All the way from being arrested through to just after I was convicted immigration didn’t cross my mind. The level of stress goes through the roof,” says Kweku, who now lives with his parents in Accra. “Suddenly, the battle’s not over. I can’t just sit in and do my time and go home.“The pressure in the relationship started to go up, because now she’s thinking, ‘Okay, so I’ve stood by him through this fight, now what? What if I keep fighting if he’s going to get deported anyway?’”Kweku had left Ghana aged four, when his parents moved to the Middle East for work. He is grateful to have his parents and other relatives now in the country, but devastated at how his relationships in Britain – including with his now ex-girlfriend and many friends – have broken down since his return.“It’s the inability of being able to get on a plane and be there for someone,” he explains. “The distance creates massive tension in the relationship. You have to increasingly distance yourself from these really close relationships. The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connections, which then leads to depression.”‘Cruelty’ as Jamaicans driven to charter flight despite court rulingAfter arriving in Ghana, Kweku spent about nine months sitting in his bedroom, unable to leave the house. He developed a number of physical manifestations of the trauma he had been through. “My body started to swell up a lot,” he says. “We thought it was a heart problem so had a lot of heart tests. My face just blew up like a balloon, my legs were like elephant trunks,”The Ghanaian national acknowledges that he was relatively lucky on his return that, unlike the Jamaican deportees, he was welcomed with open arms by both his family and the country as a whole, who gave him what he describes as a “massive embrace”.“Because of the violence and the cruelty of what happened to me, I think Ghana went, ‘This is a son of Ghana, a son of Africa, why should anyone be treated this way?’ Random people on the street would stop me. Everyone recognised me. They were all saying welcome home,” he says, adding: “My stamina is not back and I’m still dealing with adrenal failure, so I still have to do a lot of work to deal with my stress, but I’m getting back to the point where I’m starting to contribute again.”But Kweku still remembers what he went through on during his deportation: “Of all that I went through, none of it was as bad as sitting at the back of a plane with five G4S guards. I was hyperventilating, sobbing non-stop for four hours.”Branded “foreign national offenders” and “illegal immigrants” by the Home Office\u0026nbspas they wait in cells to be taken away, these deportees are characterised as hardened criminals. But for Tremayne, Chevon and Kweku, these terms – and the trauma – ripple through their lives for years to come as they try to start again, thousands of miles from the place they call home.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are changing our immigration policy to one that’s fit for purpose for our economy, based on skills.“This is not about refugees and asylum and people being persecuted around the world. We must differentiate between the two.”Ms Patel later told BBC Radio 5 Live that her parents had faced persecution in Uganda, pointing out that the changes she is introducing do not affect the way in which the UK will deal with people fleeing persecution overseas.This is not about changing rules on asylum and refugees\u0026nbspand people that are being persecuted around the world - the two are fundamentally different so I think it is wrong to conflate the two, said the home secretary.

Fewer than 1.9 million of the total were recorded as wanting a job.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe IPPR\u0026nbspthink tank calculated that Ms Patel’s immigration plans – which replace free movement with a requirement for most migrants to have a job offer worth £25,600 or more – would rule out around 70 per cent of EU workers currently in the country, delivering a “shock” to key sectors of the economy.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet reshuffle: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out  Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage hailed them as “a very big step in the right direction”.Immigration is good for the economy – put that on the side of a busGovernment’s new immigration plan denounced as ‘absolute disaster’What is in the government’s controversial new immigration plan?I’m expecting a big U-turn on Boris Johnson’s new immigration planBut Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea said they spelt “absolute disaster” for the care sector, which has not been granted an exemption from the minimum pay threshold.And the Federation of Master Builders said closing the door on “low-skill” workers would stand in the way of Mr Johnson achieving his promises of massive infrastructure investment and 1 million new homes. Brian Berry, the trade association’s chief executive,\u0026nbspsaid: “It’s simply unrealistic to assume the domestic workforce will fill this gap in the next nine months.”Dame Sara Thornton, the anti-slavery commissioner,\u0026nbspwarned that the protection of vulnerable people needs to be “front and centre” of the debate on the changes, as people-traffickers “will seek every opportunity to abuse new immigration policies” during a period of significant upheaval in the system.Meanwhile, Ms Patel conceded that her own parents – who set up a chain of newsagents after arriving in the UK in the 1960s – would not have been allowed into the UK under her new rules, though she suggested that they might instead have qualified under arrangements for refugees, having faced persecution in Uganda.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not only has she unveiled an immigration policy that potentially devastates our social care sector – detrimentally impacting on some of the most vulnerable in society – she’s also justifying it by saying that those who are carers, sick or retired should take up these jobs.“Yet again, the Tories are putting dogma ahead of the needs of the economy and it’s the vulnerable paying the price.”Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson\u0026nbspChristine Jardine said that Ms Patel’s comment was evidence that the Conservative government “does not care a jot about people’s lives”.\u0026nbsp“Rather than allowing people to travel to the UK and contribute to our economy by working, Priti Patel would rather drag people out of education, out of retirement and out of hospital beds and set them to work,” said Ms Jardine.Social care providers were loudest in their warnings about the blow the new immigration rules would deal to their sector.Migrants make up around 17 per cent of staff in adult social care – 40 per cent in London – and there are currently more than 120,000 unfilled vacancies across the country.The Nuffield Trust health think tank warned Ms Patel’s proposals risked pushing the sector “over the edge”, while Nadra Ahmed from the National Care Association said the government were\u0026nbsp“either not listening or closing their eyes to the fact that social care needs to be on the shortage occupation list”.Farmers welcomed changes to increase the number of seasonal workers they can recruit from outside the EU from 2,500 to 10,000 for the coming harvest.But the National Farmers’ Union urged the government to commit to a full scheme for 2021, so growers can recruit the 70,000 seasonal workers needed on fruit, vegetable and flower farms.NFU president Minette Batters said that failure to provide an entry route not only for fruit-pickers, but also packers, meat processors and vets, would “severely impact” on their ability to deliver high-quality, affordable food for the public.And Martin Emmett of the Horticultural Trades Association said that a “significant increase” in numbers of seasonal agricultural worker places would be needed if the industry was to help Mr Johnson deliver his manifesto pledge to plant 75,000 acres of trees a year as part of the UK’s fight against climate change.“The ornamental horticulture sector, along with other sectors, relies on a seasonal workforce for its essential operations,” he said.“We stand ready to support government targets on tree planting, import substitution, biosecurity and UK production, but the government needs to support the industry in how the shortfalls in labour are to be fulfilled in 2021 and beyond.”Federation of Master Builders\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And more people now watch YouTube than all terrestrial broadcasters put together.Even the BBCs highest paid star, Gary Lineker, says its time to make the fee voluntary, while Dame Helen Mirren admits its had its day.Yet the Government’s policy has provoked howls of outrage, especially from the chattering liberals who seem to regard the licence fee as a sacred part of our constitution.Their squeals of protest are badly misplaced. The fact is that, by guaranteeing a huge revenue stream, the licence fee promotes a culture of excess and mismanagement within the BBC, which has a budget of almost £ billion and employs , people.Its reflected in the vast salaries paid to scores of BBC stars, far beyond market rates, like the £. million previously dished out to Lineker, £, to newsreader Huw Edwards, or the £, to sports presenter Jason Mohammad.You can spot it in the host of botched or extravagant schemes, like the notorious reconstruction of the EastEnders set, whose budget soared from £ million to £. million.Worse still, a staggering £ billion was spent on the refurbishment of Broadcasting House in central London.There is also absurd doubling up among staff, particularly in the news.Last week, the BBC had  correspondents covering the American Democrat primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, while in  no fewer than  on-air journalists were sent to report on one brief Brussels summit attended by David Cameron.But the lack of any commercial pressure is most easily spotted in the vast, sprawling tiers of flabby bureaucracy.Ab Fab comedian Jenner Saunders once said of the corporation, “It’s become top-heavy in such an ugly way,” adding that it is “an executive-run place for idiots”.A glance through the BBC’s Annual Report for  shows just how correct she was.On these pages, I counted no fewer than eight managers who had “Human Resources Director” in their job titles, all of them on at least £,-a-year.Among them were: Dale Haddon, “HR Director, News and Employee Relations”, on up to £, Rachel Currie, “BBC Group HR Director” on up to £, and Gillian Taylor, “HR Director” on £,.It was the same story with BBC News, whose regiment of well-healed officials included: Fran Unsworth, the “Director of News” on £, Gavin Allen, “Head of News Output” on £, and Jonathan Munroe, Head of Newsgathering” on £,.This grasping spirit prevails throughout the bloated organisation, from the £, “Director of Nations and Regions” to the £, “Director of Radio and Education.”Insulated by public funding, the corporation adores both navel-gazing and self-promotion. So it has a “Director of Communications” on £,-a-year, a “Director of Policy” on £, and a “Director of Editorial Policy” on £,.All that puts into perspective the current moans from the BBC about the need for cuts.But apart from the managerial excess, what also aggravates is how the corporation uses its publicly-funded muscle to promote a fashionable, London-centric agenda.As the state’s monopoly broadcaster, the BBC should be utterly impartial.Yet its output is dominated by trendy political messages on immigration, climate change, Tory cuts, ersity and poverty.The BBC might have lavished reporters on the Democrat primaries, but it gave hardly any live coverage to the recent celebrations in Parliament Square at the moment of Brexit.Typically a Newsnight discussion  that evening – held in a studio bedecked with the blue and gold of the EU - featured two Remainers and one Brexiteer.Left-wing propaganda is continually crowbarred into everything from drama to discussion programmes.Just  per cent of the national workforce is employed in the public sector, yet the BBC is filled with the voices of state employees, most of them whining about under-funding.Left-wing opinions have a stranglehold most topical comedy shows, such as Radio Four’s News Quiz, hosted by the achingly unfunny Nish Kumar.It was Kumar who recently caused a storm by sneeringly presenting an edition of the BBC children’s show “Horrible Histories”, in which Britain’s Victorian past was held up for ridicule.The BBC can get away with this because of its lucrative monopoly as the state’s only broadcaster. It has abused that privileged position for too long.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one is suggesting you won’t have Strictly Come Dancing or Match of the Day or even Question Time and Newsnight.But the media is fundamentally changing. Consumer choice – what you or me choose to consume on the box or on our iPads or phones and at what time – is king.The idea that by  paying £. for a service that we may choose not to watch or listen to AT ALL is insanity.It might be unpleasant for BBC lers but the time has come to accept that the licence fee must evolve into a subscription service, so that the corporation is accountable to viewers and not the current behemoth that puts local newspapers out of business, that competes with national newspaper websites to write about Love Island, and that makes podcasts like Reality Tea all about the MTV reality series Geordie Shore.That is NOT public service broadcasting. It is a blatant and constant attempt to undercut struggling commercial rivals.But a sea change is coming. I truly feel it.Sure, there might be disagreement at Downing Street about exactly what that change will involve.Personally I’m on the side of Dominic Cummings who wants wholescale cuts. Sell Radio  and Radio , shut down the sweeping BBC Online department and focus on true public service programming that won’t be provided where. Then in  allow people the choice about whether they want to pay for what they watch from the BBC or not.But the plan by Boris Johnson - who The Times reports this morning fancies an evolution not a revolution - is also valid. The first step to decriminalise the licence fee is the start of bringing the BBC back in line.The fact we’re even having this discussion is the fault of the BBC, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and lacking in political impartiality in recent years.It disgraced itself over its coverage of Brexit.

Where is their future now  I think it’ll be dficult for them to find a way back in the Royal Family.”Details of the couple’s orce agreement emerged yesterday as the pair prepare to step down from royal duties at the end of next month.Harry, , and Meghan, , have been ordered to close their office at Buckingham ­Palace from April .They have been allowed to keep their HRH titles but have been forced to accept that they will not use them publicly as they tout for business around the globe.The couple are also likely to have to remove the lucrative “royal” from their long-cherished Sussex Royal branding — despite spending tens of thousands on a new Sussex Royal website to complement their Instagram feed, which has more than .million ­followers.They have already tried to trademark Sussex Royal, which they want to use to flog countless trinkets from bandanas to notebooks.It is also likely to mean rebranding their charitable organisation called Sussex Royal, The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Talks were said to be continuing on the use of the word “royal” but the Queen and officials have reportedly told them it would be untenable.The Sussexes have already agreed to repay the £.million of taxpayers’ money used to refurbish their Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor and are expected to pay a commercial rent for it of about £, a month.Last night, Ingrid Seward, editor in chief of Majesty magazine, said: “It seems as though they are retaining a lot of things but not actually being able to use them — like the HRH title and Harrys military position.They are obviously not going to be able to use the word ‘royal’ on their website. They obviously are royal but can’t call themselves that. They have those things but their hands are very tied. It’s almost like the man who wasn’t there.”Mr Wharfe, a former bodyguard for Princess Diana, said Harry and Meghan would be hugely disappointed with the outcome.He said: “They’d want to keep that Sussex Royal brand name — they haven’t. Without that brand it’s going to be much more dficult for their charitable causes because that was their trademark.“I think they’d want to keep the office at Buckingham Palace as well, which they now don’t have. Harry would also have wanted to have kept using the HRH title but he can’t. He will be incredibly disappointed with that.”Royal commentator Phil Dampier said the Queen had stood firm during the negotiations.He added: “Harry and Meghan have got what they wanted in the fact that they now have the freedom to make as much money as they like — but at what cost in this settlement “I don’t think Harry would have expected it to cost them so much. The Queen has not allowed a situation where they have the best of both worlds. If they are out, then that is it. No office, no titles and they cannot even use the word ‘royal’.“It will be interesting to see the public reaction to them at the events they have upcoming. It will be interesting to seethey get a warm welcome or any mixed reaction, even hostility.”Royal expert Dickie Arbiter added: “The Queen is always going to stick to her guns and make it very clear —you’re turning your back on being a full-time royal then there are conditions under which you can do it. Her Majesty has stuck to her guns.”The Sussexes are expected to be in Britain regularly over the next few months with Harry at an Invictus Games event with rock star Jon Bon Jovi on February .They will attend the Endeavour Fund awards on March  and the Duke will be at Silverstone with F racing driver Lewis Hamilton the following day.The pair will be at the Mountbatten Festival of Music on March  and Meghan will mark International Women’s Day the next day.The couple will also join the Queen and the Royal Family for the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March .A spokeswoman for the Sussexes said the couple would announce details of their new non-profit organisation later in the year.The spokeswoman said Harry’s priorities remained supporting the welfare of servicemen and women, conservation, sport for social development,HIV and Travalyst which works to mobilise the tourism and travel industry for social good.Meghan would continue to focus on women’s empowerment, gender equality and education, she added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was one of the issues on which Mr Cummings and Sajid Javid disagreed before the latter quit as Chancellor last week.But Mr Javid’s replacement, Rishi Sunak, is a No loyalist and thought unlikely to block any attempt to end the freeze on March .During the election, the PM told The Sun he had “absolutely no intention” of raising fuel duty.But allies of Mr Johnson and the new Chancellor refused to rule it out yesterday. One said: “Rishi is still getting his feet under the desk. There have been no decisions yet.”Experts say a five-year freeze will cost the Government about £billion a year.But Tory MP Robert Halfon told The Sun: “This war on motorists has got to stop.”And Howard Cox, of the FairFuel campaign, said ministers should be trying to cut fuel duty and that any rise would be “devastating to hard-pressed motorists”.It is one of several tax rises being considered.In talks yesterday, the PM and Mr Sunak were said to be looking at raids on pension tax relief and council tax rises for the rich.No declined to comment.For smart city types blessed with excellent transport links, the increase would be a nuisance.But for the Prime Minister’s new wave of voters who switched to Tory — ordinary grafters living in towns and villages — it’d be downright disastrous.Everywhere you look, these people are being hammered by the cost of living.Millions of Brits work hard day and night, yet come home to brown envelopes with yet more demands to pay. Energy bills, council tax, parking costs, phone bills, food bills — up, up, up.Of course, it’s great that the Government is investing £billion in bus and cycling routes to make le that bit cheaper for commuters.

But Ms Patel said the “economically inactive” made up a fth of the workforce. Some .million of them say they would like a job.She said many could workfirms “invested in and supported them”, adding migration was “not the solution” to social care.Hitting back at attacks from business, Ms Patel argued: “There are over eight million people between  and  who are economically inactive, that’s  per cent of the work force.“It’s important that businesses engage with them and invest in people.“If they invested in and supported them, more people would be able to work in many of the sectors.”Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth called Ms Patel “clueless”.SNP MP Stuart McDonald said it was “unrealistic” to expect the injured or ill to fill vacancies in social care, tourism and hospitality.Meanwhile it emerged that all new skilled immigrants to Britain will have to pay £, for a visa, while there will be a back door entry to the UK for the low-skilled,they are dependants of higher-skilled workers who win visas.The Indian-heritage minister’s mum and dad came to the UK in the s from Uganda, where they had run a shop.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After Brexit it will be responsible for its own influx.“Once the Dublin mechanism stops there will be no legal basis for transfers until a new deal is reached.”In  the UK submitted , requests for other Member States - mostly Italy, Germany, and France - to take back asylum seekers.But it received just , demands from fellow countries to take in refugees, largely on grounds of family reunication.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s nice to know but we definitely see this as our forever home.”After knocking down the six outhouses at the back of the property, the home now boasts a  square metre kitchen extension and open plan living space.Lucy and Dan also changed the upstairs two bedrooms and kitchenette to create an entire top floor dedicated master suite for the couple.They are also constructing a studio in the garden which could be used as an office or gym.Lucy and Dan lived opposite the derelict house for seven years.When the owner of the property passed away the couple snapped it up for £, – with the sale going through in August .They moved into the property in June the following year and estimate that they spent around £, on renovating the house.Lucy said: “It looked dilapidated and we hardly ever saw the old lady who lived in the property but we always said thatthe opportunity arose, we would definitely like to buy this house.“You could see the roof was wobbly, the roof tiles were loose, the guttering was a mess and the windows were slightly rotten.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA man described as a possessive, jealous and controlling boyfriend has been ruled to have unlawfully killed his girlfriend and detained under a hospital order after being deemed unfit to stand trial. Matthew Bolland, , from Wilmslow, was charged with murdering -year-old Pamela Ann Mellor after her body was discovered at a flat on Meriton Road, in Handforth, in the early hours of Sunday August  last year. The mum-of-four died following a sustained brutal assault involving blows to her face and head. A post-mortem examination also revealed evidence indicating that she had been strangled. Following the attack, Bolland called his mum and told her that he had murdered Pamela, of Bosley, near Macclesfield, as he believed that she had been cheating on him. He also admitted murdering her when initially questioned by the police. However, Bolland later changed his account and accused another man of going into the flat, knocking him out and killing Pamela whilst he was unconscious. Bolland also claimed his murder confessions to his mum and the police were based on him assuming that he was responsible for Pamelaaposs death having found her dead when he woke up.  He was deemed to be unfit to enter a plea or stand trial at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday February  due to mental health issues. Subsequently, instead of being asked to rule on whether or not Bolland was guilty of murder after hearing all of the evidence that was presented, the jury had to decide whether or not he was responsible for her unlawful killing. The jury delivered a unanimous decision on Wednesday. After being found to have unlawfully killed Pamela, Bolland was detained at a secure hospital. Detective Inspector Paul Hughes, of Cheshire Constabulary’s Major Investigation Team, said: Pamela Ann Mellor was subjected to a horric degree of violence and died of the extensive injuries she sustained.

Liam Grfin abused his helpless victim on “numerous” occasions over a -month period. Hamilton Sherf Court in Scotland heard on Friday how the assaults started when the girl was in Pand happened as often as “every two weeks”. The court was told the primary pupil didn’t realise she was being abused until her class started sex education lessons, reports the Daily Record. When he was arrested, -year-old Grfin told cops: I was studying to be a doctor, but I f***ed up everything. Court heard the young victim had kept quiet for months, but finally blurted out what had happened during an argument with her sister. Medical student Grfin, of Hamilton, admitted abusing the girl between August  and August last year. Prosecuting, Mairi-Clare McMillan told the court: “She said he had subjected her to numerous episodes of sexual abuse, sometimes as often as every two weeks. “This occurred when she visited his home and it was always in his bedroom when they were alone. If another girl was there Grfin would send her downstairs on some pretence. “The girl said she didn’t realise at first that what he did was wrong, but this changed through her getting sex education at school.” After assaulting her on the final occasion Grfin said “bye” to his victim and left the house to visit his girlfriend – she has now distanced herself from him, changing her relationship status online and deleting all pictures of Grfin from her profile. The abuse came to light on August  last year when the victim was having an argument with her sister at home. They began to shout and during this she disclosed that the accused had touched her inappropriately and made her touch him. Ms McMillan added: “On hearing the argument, the girls’ mother went to the bedroom where she was told by the victim that the accused had sexually assaulted her. “The accused’s mother was contacted.

Trevor Weston, , from Cardf, has caused a splash online as his courageous act of self-defence was caught on CCTV for all the world to see. An armed mugger threatened to stab himhe did not give up his money at the cash point - but Trevor was having none of it, throwing well-time punches and seeing the scumbag criminal off. Amazingly, Trevor did all this despite recently breaking his right shoulder - meaning he effectively fought the cowardly crook off with just his left hand. WalesOnline spoke to the granddad-of-three, who said he never had to get violent in all his years on the buses.But for some reason, on Monday at the supermarket on Colchester Avenue in Cardf, as he was pushed against a bin with a weapon waved in his face, his instincts told him to put up his guard and fight back. Trevor said: Iaposm up at am every morning - the result of working on the buses for  years, Iaposm afraid, said Somerset-born Trevor, who has lived in Cardf since he was a small boy. I needed money to buy the papers so decided to drive down to the local Sainsburyaposs because all the shops closer to me charge you to make withdrawals from their cash machines. Normally thereaposs staff milling about outside, waiting to be let in. But, that day, there was no one. Anyway, I got out my £ and had just put my wallet back in my pocket when this bloke - this aposthingapos - came from nowhere, grabbed me and said, aposgive me your money or Iaposll stab youapos. Trevor has gone viral as the video clip, captured by a Sainsburyaposs security camera and shared on social media by South Wales Police, has been viewed almost , times, with many people praising the pensioner for standing up for himself in a situation where most would have folded and fled.Trevor had made an early morning stop at the store to get money for his daily newspapers when he was approached from behind by a man wearing a hi-vis jacket and a baseball cap. The would-be robber assaulted him and demanded he hand over his wallet. But Trevoraposs skillful blows saw the coward flee in terror.  Iaposve never had a fight in my le, even when I was dealing with troublemakers on the buses years ago, he said. If anyone got on who was drunk, aggressive and refusing to pay, Iaposd go, aposjust go and sit down, mateapos - it wasnapost worth the hassle. But, in this instance, when he demanded I hand over my money, I replied, aposyou what  Do you want some of this, pal apos And I put up my guard.  Actually, itaposs a good job thereaposs no sound on that video because I probably turned the air blue with what I really said. Trevor said he had previously broken his right shoulder in a fall at home after putting up some curtains and so could only land a decent left punch on his assailant. I cracked him a couple of times and he looked stunned, like he couldnapost believe what I was doing.And, to be honest, neither could I. The moment Trevor lands a blow hard on the jaw happened just as the CCTV footage cut out. But Trevor explained this is what finally caused him to stagger away down a nearby public footpath. After heaposd gone I just drove home and gave my son a lt to work. It wasnapost until about am that I called the police, he said.

fitness journey that saw him shed lbs with the help of a personal trainer at Elite Fitness gymShareCommentsByOrlaith Clinton:,  FEB NewsJohn Doran before his dramatic weight loss \" to FREE email

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA student lost six stone in the same number of months after his confidence hit an all time low. With his weight affecting his self-esteem and well being, John Doran decided to embark on an intense fitness regime.The -year-old from Newcastle, County Down completed a  week training and nutrition programme at aposElite Fitnessapos gym, losing lbs in the process, Belfast Live reported. Over the next three months he lost a further lbs. Now having never felt better, the business student has spoken of how his mental health has improved since he met personal trainer David Rice. He said: I wanted to start my weight loss transformation because it was having an affect on my self-esteem and overall well-being, basically I was at an all time low in my le.I chose Davy at  Elite Fitness to help me through my journey because it is in my local gym and I knew of people who have went there before and have had amazing transformations - so I thought Iaposd give it a go.And Davy was brilliant throughout the whole process always pushing me even when I had nothing left. I definitely would recommend him. Iaposve made lestyle changes and have cut out all heavily fat orientated food, removed eating chocolate bars and other things throughout the day. I purchase meals from Health Grain who provide  meals Monday-Friday and then I make my own healthy food for the weekends. I also rarely drink anymore which has helped me lose the weight.In terms of my  confidence and mental health, I feel like itaposs never been better.Before the gym I was quite reluctant to talk to people and just didnapost want to do anything really. I didnapost enjoy le that much but now things are on the up.  Personal trainer David spoke of his slight doubts about whether John would stick with it when he first hit the gym. I have had quite a lot of transformations over a letime of clients, and Johnaposs is one that I wonapost forget, he said. He was a complete beginner who like most was probably very nervous and unsure of what was ahead of him. David went on to explain the fitness regime he laid out for John. Our first sessions consisted of basic movement and mobility again, and tailoring it to suit his level and needs along the way - just finding out which way he enjoyed most, the trainer continued.  Believe it or not it has been mainly weight lting and cardio he enjoyed, so I mixed it up into a strength and conditioning programme to suit the stuff he liked but little did he know that it was going to be his newly found passion for fitness, sports  nutrition. John didnapost just learn more than most personal trainers, he lost almost seven stone before actually maintaining weight to build some muscle in to his new transformed body which he worked consistently for over the space of two  week stages.

He said: aposaposMy we is a bit battered and has two black eyes, a bump on the head and bruising to her chest but apart from that we escaped unscathed. aposaposWe were driving along and out of the corner of my eye I saw the tree coming down. The car was on Autopilot and the emergency braking kicked in.  aposaposIt was chaos with smoke coming from the car and people shouting to get out.

I canapost believe weaposre all still alive. Elon Musk has done us proud.aposapos Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety behind the wheel.  external cameras, a radar,  ultrasonic sensors and a powerful onboard computer provide an additional layer of safety to guide drivers on their journey.  Autopilot uses these features to see and sense the environment around the car. This robust sensor and camera suite provides drivers with an awareness of their surroundings that a driver alone would not otherwise have. A powerful onboard computer processes these inputs in a matter of milliseconds to help make your driving safer and less stressful. Active safety features made possible by Teslaaposs Autopilot hardware and software system include Automatic Emergency Braking which detects cars or obstacles that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly. Speaking about the other car, Laurence, from Brentwood, Essex, said: aposaposIn an amazing one a million chance another Tesla Model X car was also hit on the other side of the tree. The police have told me that all three are fine so eight lives have quite literally saved due to this amazing car.aposapos Construction company director Josh Whitelock, , from Wimborne, was driving the other Tesla with his girlfriend, Kitty McConnell and her mum, Julia as passengers when the tree came down.  aposaposI was on Autopilot driving home when I saw a flash from the power line which lit up the tree as it fell. We stopped suddenly. There was a loud crack and then the sound of metal on metal. aposaposI was expecting to turn around and see my girlfriend and her mother impaled by branches but incredibly that wasnapost the case. They were both ok apart from a bit of whiplash. It was a miracle we all survived. aposaposI helped get them both out of the car and then checked on the other driver on the other side of the tree.

Those already battling with the aftermath of several days worth of rain have been told to expect even more, with pockets of North Wales, northern England and Scotland among those in line for further deluges. The Environment Agencywarned there is a heightened flood risk across the Midlands, while there are six severe flood warnings - meaning a danger to le - in place around the Rivers Lugg, Severn and Wye. The lower Avon also remains dangerously high.Have you been affected by flooding  Email webnews@mirrorAs of Wednesday afternoon, flood warnings remain for  places, with a further  lower category alerts also present. Trunk roads have been forced to close and hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes in the worst-affected areas. But forecasters have predicted further heavy rainfall is on its way, three days after Storm Dennis left the UK for Scandinavia.Craig Snell, from the Met Office, said: Hot on the heels of Storm Dennis, we have now got this next weather system coming through. We have a cluster of warnings around the UK running today into tomorrow. Rainfall totals are not too high at the moment. Butwe are looking at the situation in  hoursapos time, we could be looking at -mm in South Wales, -mm in North Wales, and up to mm in north west England. In the worst case scenario we could see a monthaposs worth of rain. It is more the fact that quite a lot of the UK has seen a wet winter. Ordinarily, mm of rain would give us a wet day, rivers would be able to cope.  But the ground is saturatedso it is causing problems. On one of the flooded roads on the outskirts of Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, a man in green waders, unperturbed by the high water, was heading into town on foot with an empty shopping bag. The man - who declined to give his name - said he was off into Upton to have a pint and get some bread and milk. He added that the  floods had been worse, estimating the water levels had been fthigher.  The Environment Agency said England had already received % of its average February rainfall so far this month. River levels in the Colne, Ribble, Calder, Aire, Trent, Severn, Wye, Lugg, and Derwent all set new records in recent days, the EA said. The agency announced its teams put up more than km of temporary flood barriers across the country and that flood defences have protected nearly , properties from the ongoing impacts of Storm Dennis. John Curtin, EA executive director, said: We expect further disruptive weather today, bringing a signicant flood risk to the West Midlands.

Amber Breeana Luke, , got her first inking when she was just  because she wanted to know what it feels like, and she immediately caught the bug. Her first design was simple old-fashioned calligraphy which read aposyou can keep knocking, but wonapost knock me down no love lost, no love foundapos. But now, every inch of her body is covered with stunning designs, including flowers, skulls, animals and block patterns. Amber, from New South Wales, Australia, said: At first it was because I wanted to know what the feeling was like – I craved it even though I had no idea what it felt like. Once the needle penetrated my skin, it felt like home. My passion developed when I was  years old, I started to get more heavily tattooed. The feeling I got from getting tattooed was like no other I had experienced – I literally felt the negative energy disperse from my body, minute by minute. Amber, who works as an apprentice tattooist while studying to become a traffic controller, isnapost exactly sure how many tattoos she has in total, having stopped counting when she reached  - but she thinks sheaposs had at least  more since then. Her passion has set her back about ,AUS, which is about £,.  She also her tongue split in two and a silicone implant in her eye to make her look like a pixie. Perhaps her most shocking tattoo - and Amberaposs favourite - is her eyeballs, which she has had coloured in bright blue. She said: My eyeballs caused me the most immense pain Iaposve endured so far, but theyaposre worth it.Every morning when I wake up and look at my eyeballs, it makes me happy because blue is my absolute favourite colour.  Her love for tattoos coincided with her deciding to get help with her mental health struggles after an extremely dficult few years. She said: My upbringing was great. My mother worked her hardest all the time and gave me everything I needed. I was extremely lonely though. I’m an only child, and because my mother worked so many hours – dad wasnapost really in the picture – I hardly got to see her. And, over time, I developed an immense desire to never be alone.  Depression and anxiety developed at age , Borderline Personality Disorder with Schizophrenic traits came a little bit later on. But everything changes as she celebrated her th birthday. She said: I decided I wanted to stop hating myself at age . The hatred I harboured in my heart for my image was relentlessly brutal. My depression played a huge part in it, but my perspective of myself was shunned so much that I would avoid leaving the house for weeks at a time.  Things got so bad that Amber attempted suicide at least  times. She said: Of all of those traumatic events, there was one other-worldly experience. I wonapost go into to much detail, but when I was hanging there, blacking out, I heard a heavenly presence tell me “Amber, itaposs not your time”’.Thats when i felt someone unravel the rope around my neck and i fell to the floor, crying and hyperventilating.    I can still hear the voice to this day.

We still wanted to implement our style of game but it just wasn’t to be on the night.“We still tried to find an opening but we were just lacking a little bit in the final third.”One way in which playing for United is dferent than being at Hamilton, though, is the weight of expectation.More accustomed to fighting at the bottom end of the table, Bingham believes battling for the Championship title is a dferent challenge but that it requires similar qualities.Recent slump in form is no huge cause for concern for league leaders Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp united-need-not-fret-over-worst-form-of-season embed # secretStwoJgp\" data-secret\"StwoJgp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“It’s a little bit dferent compared to trying to stay up, it’s a dferent kind of mindset you need.“In terms of winning, you still need a mindset to be consistent and there’s a reason why we’re up there and first by  points because we’ve been consistent throughout the season.“We can’t drop that standard evenwe’re playing teams near the bottom, it doesn’t really matter, you still need to be on top of your game. vw, px\"  “It’s a great bunch of lads so we’re just going to keep digging and driving to get that promotion.”The Terrors’ focus now turns to Friday’s visit of Inverness to Tannadice and Bingham is ready to go.“It’s a big club and I was pleased to see the turnout from the away fans on Friday. This week at home is going to be an even bigger turnout for us for a big game.“It’s game we want to get three points from and definitely do one on Inverness.

year we’ve held the event in the Caird Hall and it shows just how big it has become over the years.“In the early days we used to hold it at the Invercarse Hotel but we outgrew that and moving to the Caird Hall allows us to invite more people to the event.”The ersity of nominees this year shows the solid sporting base there is across the city and Alex is thrilled to see so many up for awards.She’s

Dundee couple has celebrated  years of marriage after being wed in the city back in .George and Jessie McInally celebrated their diamond anniversary with their family on February  and remembered their first meeting fondly.Jessie, , said: “We met at the Palais when I was just .“Back in that time there was no dancing on a Sunday you just went along to watch people sing and grabbed a seat where you could find one.“That is when George started talking to me and we went on our first date either to the pictures or to the dancing, it is so long ago I can’t quite remember.“From then on we were an item and we were engaged within  months.”When askedthe engagement was a surprise George added jokingly: “Well it was a surprise to me.”When talking to the couple you can tell why this marriage has lasted so long, the cheeky pair were constantly making each other laugh, evenit was at the other’s expense.Jessie joked: “Oh it feels like much longer than  years, I could have done three times in the jail.”With George, , adding: “I didn’t even think we would last two weeks.”However, the marriage at Chalmers Church certainly did last – eventhere was some trouble on the big day.Jessie said: “It was a fine wedding and everything went well except the minister forgot to collect our wedding banns so we lived in sin for a couple of days.”Jessie then exclaimed: “Not that anything happened!”George added: “The minister, Reverend Alex Farrow said he would pick up the banns for us as a favour but he forgot on the wedding day, it was all sorted about a week later though.”The wedding was attended by about  guests, which Jessie says was normal for the time.“In those days you couldn’t afford big weddings so we only had a small amount of guests.“I picked my dress from a shop in town where Patisserie Valerie now is, I saw it and instantly thought I like that one.“It only cost about £ I think but that was a lot in those days.”The reception was held at the F and K Halls.Jessie was joined by her big sister Margaret who acted as her bridesmaid and George’s best man was pal David Kendall.George and Jessie went on to welcome daughter Susan in  with son Stephen being born in  and third child Alison being born in .They now also have nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.When asked how they think they have lasted this long the couple agreed that being cheeky to each other, honesty and agreeing to disagree definitely helped their marriage.Jessie added: “What I have always said is he is Mr Right but I am Mrs Always Right.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/SNS-19245303-Dundee-United-vs.-Dundee-794x564.jpg ","title":"dee aim to show its all change at palmerston park","story":"Dundee’s recent trips to Palmerston haven’t been too successful but the Dark Blues of  have their sights set on changing that this time around.The Dens men have managed just the one victory in their last nine trips to Queen of the South – a - win on their way to the Championship title in  thanks to a Ryan Conroy penalty – stretching back over the last decade.However, even from the last meeting in September, there could be considerable changes to the way James McPake sets his side out as he plots a way to double that win rate.The clash on a Friday night on TV saw Jordan McGhee net his first goal for the Dark Blues with a fine header after Queens striker Jack Hamilton had beaten his namesake in the Dundee goal early on.That was a disappointing night for the Dens gaffer as his side struggled to find their feet in the Championship.And he’ll be hoping this version of the Dark Blues can show there’s been some good work done in the time since.After another poor spell at the start of the year, Dundee have put together two positive displays to earn a point at Mortonand win convincingly at home to Partick Thistle last time out.Should boss James decide to stick with the same line-up and -- formation, there will only be four names remaining on the team sheet from the autumn.Of the team that saw off the Jags last time out, only Jordon Forster, Declan McDaid, Graham Dorrans and Kane Hemmings featured in the last trip down to Dumfries.McGhee grabbed the goal that day but he and Cammy Kerr are both recovering from surgery and Saturday may come too soon for them.And with the three-man defence working so well with Christophe Berra added in against Thistle, the Dens gaffer might be tempted to stick rather than twist.That’s likely to see Josh Meekings retain his place also with McDaid filling in at left wing-back and Christie Elliott on the right.Of the midfield three, Dorrans is a stick-on to start, barring any injury problems, while Shaun Byrne has been impressing in training in recent weeks and showed up well against the Jags.The big decision for James is who to put in the place of Ross Callachan.The on-loan midfielder had injected dynamism to the middle of the park and was unlike anything  in the squad.That could see Paul McGowan drop back to a deeper role after stepping in as a makesht striker last week.And Callachan’s energy could be replaced by fit-again Andrew Nelson after he ed from surgery to his hand for the closing stages last time out.Another certainty, barring injury, is Kane Hemmings as he targets moving his goal tally into double figures for the season. vw, px\"  The Doonhamers will have a dferent look about them as well with three key players having left in the winter window.On-loan goalie Robby McCrorie was

","title":"dundee stars omar pacha sheffield steelers","story":"KITMART Dundee Stars toppled Elite League leaders Sheffield Steelers - in their own building on Saturday night and collected two crucial points in their play-off push.That key win has put Dundee back within a point of Glasgow Clan and Manchester Storm, who still occupy the seventh and eighth play-off places.Speaking after his side’s big win over Sheffield, Stars head coach Omar Pacha said: “I am really happy for them, the boys were dialled in from the drop of the puck after a great week of practice.“The first five minutes, I think that is the best start we have had all year and I thought we were unlucky not to get something a bit earlier in that period.“But as the game went on we built a bit of confidence in our game and we got the scoring we needed at crucial times with powerplay goals.“The big shorthanded goal was probably the big dference.”Stars put Steelers keeper, Tomas Duba, under pressure after just seconds of play but no early goals were given up by the home side.However, Aaron Fox’s men were handed the first powerplay when Dundee’s Matt Carter was punished for a hooking foul in the sixth minute.That allowed Marc-Olivier Vallerand to fire Sheffield into the lead.The next scoring opportunity fell to the Steelers’ Tanner Eberle, as he created his own breakaway but Stars goalie, Alex Leclerc, stood up to the challenge.Pacha’s men tied the game up on  minutes as captain Matt Marquardt beat Duba low to his right.In the second period, Stars came out with a good tempo and quickly got themselves ahead as Egils Kalns turned Jordan Cownie’s pass in after  minutes.Dundee then had to defend for a period of time as Sheffield came looking for an equaliser but the Scottish side survived the waves of attack before doubling their lead.The Stars were a man down as Jagger Dirk was in the sin bin for slashing but Dufour and Beauregard combined inside the th minute to make it -, as Beauregard deflected the puck past Duba.There had been a physical aspect to the match all night and, after a clean hit by Dundee blueliner Shawn Boutin on Brendan Connolly, the Steelers centerman retaliated with a late one after the whistle on Boutin to earn a two-minute roughing minor.Stars then went on the powerplay in the th minute and just five seconds into their man advantage, Carter tapped in the rebound for the Tayside team’s fourth of the night.The visitors started and ended the middle period on a high but they needed a big third period to fend off a comeback from the league leaders.Fox’s side looked like they would maybe get something but Dundee scrambled the danger clear before going back on the powerplay, as a flurry of fouls meant Sheffield would go down to three skaters.Colton Kroeker finished off Carter’s square pass on  minutes to put Stars - in front.Anthony DeLuca did win a penalty shot in the th minute but his effort went wide of the target.Troncinsky pulled one back for the Yorkshire outfit to reduce the deficit to - inside the final two minutes but that would be the final score.With a win in their only game of the weekend, the Stars now have a week to prepare for their next game against their arch enemies Fe Flyers at the Dundee Ice Arena next Saturday."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Ella-Phillips-and-great-granddaughter-Megan-423x564.jpg ","title":"four

young pair can go down same path as rising star sam hickey","story":"Lochee Amateur Boxing Club’s Jerry Howett believes two of his brightest talents can follow in the footsteps of rising star Sam Hickey.Head coach Howett has high hopes for his son Brendan and Luca Flynn and thinks they have just as much potential as former Lochee ABC boxer Hickey – now training with Team Scotland in Glasgow.Both have enjoyed winning starts to the year with Howettearning gold at the Northern District Open Championships  days ago.  Flynnregistered a silver at the same event, following up from his gold at the Scottish Intermediate Championships.And Howett, who comes from a boxing family entrenched in the Lochee community, is delighted with how the pair are progressing.He said: “Luca did well to win at the intermediate Scottish Championships. He had to fight three times, beating last year’s Scottish champion in the semis.“He lost to him in the final of the Northern District Championships but a silver from that is still very good.“He was a bit disappointed but that’s the way it goes sometimes.“Brendan did really well to win the Northern District. He had to fight twice against a couple of tough boys.”Howett feels all his young stars can aspire to reach the heights of former Lochee greats Billy Buchanan, Ronnie Clark and Mike Towell.“Luca used to do gymnastics, which was a bit of a help when he first came but he’s took to the movement in boxing really well.“We’ve got high hopes for him going forward. He could win the Scottish Open Championships at the end of the month.“Luca’s dedication is good and Brendan will get up in the morning to go running and look after his diet.“Brendan’s in for the Senior Open Championships in March, which is a big one because it counts towards being picked for the Commonwealth Games squad in .“He went last year and did well in his first season as a senior so he’s hoping to go one better.“We’ve had Sam, who’s full-time with Boxing Scotland and has went on to earn European medals and win the British Championships, so he’s progressing well.“It’s good to see them taking their chances and there’s more talent to come – Ali Mahmood, Logan Howett and Lennon Mitchell for example. vw, px\"  “Sam is travelling all over now. He’s had assessments with the British squad as well but not quite got in there. Even young Luca is working his way through the Boxing Scotland system. He’s one for the future.”It can be stressful but Howett believes the rewards are worth it.“The building wasn’t getting used for a while but we got it back up and running again with our boxing section.

Both women are completely unaware.”She added a search warrant was granted for Hawick’s flat and a laptop, mobile phone and camera were seized and he was later arrested.Ms McVicar said while in police custody the teenager admitted responsibility for taking the photos.He was released on bail with a condition he could not possess any electronic devices.Defence lawyer Paul Barnett said his client understood the “seriousness” of the offence.He also asked Hawick be placed on standard bail conditions, claiming the order would be “hugely problematic” as his client needed access to the internet to look for a job."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/5a5f0dcd1e493-140x79.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"match report late heroics send dons into scottish cup quarter final","story":"Aberdeen edged out Kilmarnock to reach the Scottish Cup quarter-finals in a thriller at Rugby Park.It looked like Mohamed El Makrini#s first half strike would win this fth round replay for Ayrshire side, but Andy Considine#s equaliser in the dying embers forced extra-time.Two minutes into the additional  Matty Kennedy put the Reds ahead but Eamonn Brophy#s free-kick levelled proceedings and when Nicke Kabamba pounced three minutes from time it looked like the Dons were out.But Sam Cosgrove#s penalty and Connor Johnson#s own goal in the last couple of minutes secured a - win and sets up a quarter-final against St Mirren a week on Saturday.The Dons controlled possession in the early stages, however, it was Killie that had the first effort on goal with Eamonn Brophy#s low drive from  yards easy enough for visiting goalie Joe Lewis to deal with.After Aberdeen#s early dominance of the ball the hosts found their feet and had the Reds penned in for a spell, although solid defending meant the Ayrshire side#s pressure didn#t result in any clear-cut chances.Shortly before the half hour mark Stephen O#Donnell was almost through as Killie broke out at pace, but Dylan McGeouch#s challenge averted the danger.In terms of attempts at goal a Curtis Main shot that was blocked a Niall McGinn long-ranger that bounced miles wide was as good as it got for Aberdeen in the first half.But as the interval approached Killie took the lead. Chris Burke cross from the right was headed up in the air and when it dropped El Makrini pounced with an acrobatic volleyed finish that deceived Lewis.McInnes went for it in the second half as he made a three subs at half-time.Shay Logan, Dean Campbell and Sam Cosgrove were sent on for Bryson, Dylan McGeouch and Connor McLennan.Despite the alterations it was Killie who had the first decent second half chance when Gary Dicker played in Brophy in the rd minute, but Lewis did well to block the left-footed strike.The Dons did respond with Logan teeing up Niall McGinn at the edge of the box, but he bent an effort narrowly wide.With  minutes left Brophy passed up a good chance to put the opportunity beyond doubt arrowing a shot wide after O#Donnell#s surge down the right, and they were made to pay a minute from the end of normal time as Considine#s glancing header from Niall McGinn#s right wing free-kick found the bottom left corner.The Reds could have won the game in stoppage time when Cosgrove headed Logan#s cross from the right flank against the top of the bar.But two minutes into extra-time the Dons did have the lead. Main burrowed his way clear down the right and while Laurentiu Branescu blocked his strike from the narrowest of angles Kennedy was on hand to head home the rebound.Unfortunately the lead was to last only six minutes as Brophy#s superb free-kick into the bottom left corner from  yards made it -.And it looked like it would be heartbreak for Aberdeen with three minutes of extra time left.O#Donnell beat Campbell down the right and Mikey Devlin#s attempt to clear the cross hit Lewis and rebounded out for Kabamba to make it - from close range.What followed was a miraculous smash and grab from the Dons to reach the quarter-finals.In the th minute Stuart Findlay wiped out Ferguson in the box and after Nick Walsh gave the penalty Cosgrove finished from  yards.And in the final minute Considine#s driven cross from the left was turned into his own net by Killie sub Connor Johnson.Kilmarnock: Laurentiu Branescu, Stephen O’Donnell, Stuart Findlay, Kirk Broadfoot, Niko Hamalainen, Alan Power, Gary Dicker, Mohamed El Makrini, Chris Burke , Nicke Kabamba, Eamonn Brophy .Subs not used: Jan Koprivec, Greg Kiltie, Dario Del Fabro, Alistair Taylor, Kyle Connell.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Ash Taylor , Scott McKenna, Andy Considine, Connor McLennan , Lewis Ferguson, Craig Bryson , Dylan McGeouch , Matty Kennedy, Niall McGinn, Curtis Main.Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Ryan Hedges, Bruce Anderson."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"kidney-research-uk-takes-another-tour-o-borders","story":"BORDERS cycling event company, Hillside Outside, have announced

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

It will support our renowned universities and world beating high-tech sector. It avoids putting up barriers to business by splitting our UK-wide system and it ensures our whole economy can continue to grow.However, opposition parties were highly critical.Diane Abbott for Labour claimed it was not an Australian points-based system, as promoted by UK ministers, but a salary threshold system, which, she argued, would ldquoneed to have so many exemptions - for the NHS, for social care and many parts of the private sector - it will be meaningless.The Shadow Home Secretary added: ldquoUltimately, it will also be very dficult to attract the workers we need at all skill levels while the Toriesrsquo hostile environment is in place. It needs to go.Scottish Government Migration Minister Ben Macpherson said: ldquoThe UK Governmentrsquos immigration proposals are an insult to Scotland - they completely disregard the needs of our employers, our public services and our communities.ldquoThere is a clear need for a fundamentally dferent approach to migration policy to reflect Scotlandrsquos distinct demographic and geographical needs. The UK Government promised a system that would deliver for all of the UK including Scotland yet these proposals do not reflect the clear evidence from employers, local authorities, universities and experts about their needs. Indeed there is not a single reference to Scotland in the document.ldquoTelling employers that they will just need to adjust will be deeply concerning to our agriculture sector to our care sector and to our transport sector. We need an evidence based approach to immigration policy which reflects the needs of our economy and has been developed through engagement with employers and communities. ldquoThe Scottish Government put forward a clear, workable proposal of devolving immigration powers by introducing a Scottish Visa, which would allow Scotland to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes we need for our communities and economy to flourish.ldquoOur proposals have widespread support across the business and third sector communities in Scotland, and it is time the UK Government listened to those voices, instead of ploughing ahead with their deeply damaging proposals which will devastate the Scottish economy and our future prosperity.Stuart McDonald for the SNP denounced the ldquoone-size-fits-all approach adopted by the Conservative Government, saying it would pose a ldquovery real threat to Scotland.ldquoBoris Johnsonrsquos crackdown on so-called low-skilled migration will devastate sectors such as hospitality, social care, agriculture and scientic research many key industries across Scotland will no longer have access to vital workers we desperately need.The Liberal Democrats accused the Government of basing its policy on ldquoxenophobia, not the social and economic needs of our country.Christine Jardine, the partyrsquos Home Affairs spokeswoman, said: ldquoToo many businesses are already struggling to hire the workers they need. Now the Tories want to stop them recruiting all but the highest paid employees from abroad.The Edinburgh MP added: ldquoTen months is nowhere near enough time for either employers or the Home Office to get ready for these new rules, creating chaos and confusion.Adam Marshall for the British Chambers of Commerce said: ldquoThe speed and scale of these changes will require signicant adjustment by businesses.ldquoCompanies are already investing heavily in home-grown talent across the UK but critical labour shortages mean firms will still need access to overseas workers at all skill levels.ldquoThe new points system must be able to respond quickly to changing market needs and the application process must be radically simplied.:Boris Johnson dismisses Nicola Sturgeons plan for Scottish Visa as absolutely fanculChristina McAnea, Assistant General Secretary of the public services union Unison, declared: ldquoThese plans spell absolute disaster for the care sector.She pointed out companies and councils could not recruit enough staff from the UK so have to rely on care workers from where. ldquoBut even with these migrant employees, therersquos still way too few care workers to meet demand.Ms McAnea said care work was low paid but highly skilled, so fell foul of the Governmentrsquos ldquoarbitrary immigration threshold.She added: ldquoSuddenly ending this desperately needed supply of labour will cause huge problems across the country.

What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age. What baffles women is why, with such a simple formula for success ndash unlike the minefield of female fashion ndash there are still so many men dressing badly."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-centre-new-space-race-uks-first-launch-site","story":"The most northerly outpost of Britain, Unst in the Shetland Isles, is anticipating a tourism boom as plans have been unveiled for a privately funded project to build a satellite launch site.More than poundmillion has been poured into the proposals by investors but planning permission has yet to be submitted to the Shetland Islands Council.:Spaceport vision falls back to earthIn Sutherland, Caithness, the UK Space Agency plans to build a vertical launch site, with plans submitted to Highland Council on February  and construction is expected to start this year.However, the pound. million Space Hub Sutherland will not cater to lsquospace touristsrsquo - unlike the Shetland Space Centre.A report commissioned by the UK Space Agency had identied Unst as the best spot in Britain for launching small satellites into space.Crofters on the tiny island have welcomed plans for the Shetland Space Centre and have agreed to lease land in a bid to make it happen.And the local authority welcomed the pound,, investment from private equity firm Leonne International.Chair of the councilrsquos development committee, Alastair Cooper, said: ldquoThis announcement of private equity funding for the Shetland Space Centre is positive news.ldquoThe council is committed to supporting local economic opportunities and we hope to maximise the benefit for Unst and Shetland as this project develops.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

He also asked for an update on the progress of current candidate mast locations in Burray, Hoy and Stromness.In response, Paul Wheelhouse, minister for connectivity and the islands, stated that no new proposed mast locations have been introduced since April  and — despite regular engagement with mobile operators — no operator has committed to using any of the candidate mast locations.Last July, Mr McArthur wrote to mobile phone operators urging them to engage constructively with the programme in Orkney.The MSP said: “It is disappointing to see that progress in closing gaps in mobile phone coverage across Orkney appears to have stalled.“While the Minister has provided assurances that discussions with mobile phone companies are ongoing, there is no sign they are prepared to engage seriously.  Sites have been identied in Stromness, Hoy and Burray, yet people and businesses in these communities are missing out on the better mobile coverage that should be available.“Meantime, efforts to identy new sites appear to have come to a complete halt. That is not good enough.“Ministers and mobile phone operators clearly agreed that public money was needed to plug existing gaps in the network. Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground. As a result, we now have a G Infill Programme that is doing next to no infilling.“I will be urging Ministers to investigate why so little progress has been made and reiterating the need to get the programme back on track”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website.

Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team.

She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business.

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place.

Once I started, I just couldn#t stop.The le of a pigeon fancier gets even more demanding when racing season starts.When spring arrives it#ll be races nearly every weekend, Keelie said.On Friday nights I#ll be at the club getting the birds ready to go wherever the race is from. Then on Saturday, all day, I#ll be glued to the skies watching for them to come back.I#ve had a few friends come around to see the lofts and I know a lot of them think it#s all a bit strange, but it#s not to me.This has brought the family so close together.

He then added to an audience who hung on his every word: #I#ve proved I am not stupid and never give up on your dreams#. I thought it summed up perfectly what I wanted to say to young people starting out on le#s journey.Never give up on your dreams became the theme of Bishop Tony#s homily to hundreds of children in his diocese on their confirmation days.It also gave me the chance to tell them the story of Harry Gregg, he added.He was renowned for his sporting prowess and for his bravery in the Munich air disaster. But he was also to be admired for the highest values and standards he lived by.Harry could be forthright and direct, as many have acknowledged in the tributes to him. He didn#t suffer fools gladly. But he also had a warm and gentle side.I treasured his friendship and his company.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBishop Tony Farquhar FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBishop Tony FarquharBishop Tony, a well-known and hugely respected figure in Northern Ireland football at all levels, has been a regular attender at Windsor Park internationals since the s when Gregg#s career began.I was captivated by his fearless goalkeeping style, he said. One of my earliest memories of him is in the infamous Battle of Belfast against Italy in  which turned into a free-for-all between the teams. No one who was there could forget it.I was fortunate in later le to get to know Harry at the Milk Cup, which he helped establish, on his native North Coast.We became friends and one of the nicest Christmas presents I have ever received was a copy of his autobiography, which he arranged to sign for me one day at his house at Articlave, near Castlerock.I was there for over two hours before he produced a pen. We talked and talked about football in particular and le in general. He was an incredibly learned and interesting man. I noticed a framed schoolboy international jersey had pride of place over his Manchester United and senior Northern Ireland shirts and always remember him explaining thatit hadn#t been for that first jersey, there wouldn#t have been any more.Dundee United-supporting Bishop Tony#s own football roots are in the universities game, being closely associated with Queen#s and the University of Ulster at Coleraine. He has travelled the world watching football and at the World Cup in Italy in  was famously instrumental in arranging for the competing Republic of Ireland team an audience with the Pope at The Vatican.The bond between the Catholic Bishop and the Coleraine Protestant is not as unlikely as it may have seemed.Gregg was ambivalent when it came to creeds. A regular churchgoer when he left Coleraine to begin his career in England, he once explained: I attended church on a Sunday everywhere I travelled with United and Northern Ireland. If I couldn#t find one of my own Protestant faith, I attended a Catholic service, because to me a church is a church.Belfast Related ContentCommentOpinionJim Gracey:Passionate, entertaining, meticulous... with Harry Gregg there were no grey areasIt was a sight guaranteed to strike fear into the heart of a young reporter... ing to the office to find a yellow post-it note stuck to your keyboard and bearing a two word summons - #Fone Harry#.FootballOpinionSteven Beacom:As both a goalkeeper and as a human being, legendary Harry Gregg stayed true to himselfHarry Gregg.

Ards and North Down Borough Council had said yesterday the local authority would not be flying the flag at its designated site on Church Street in Newtownards because the Duke of York is no longer a working Royal. However, in a statement today a council spokesperson told the Belfastthe decision had been made by council officers in error.The error was corrected mid-morning on  February and our one designated flag is now flying in addition to the seven flags that fly on council properties across the borough throughout the year, the spokesperson added. The Prince is currently dogged by allegations that he slept with Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. he strenuously denies wrongdoing.The allegations against the Queen#s son led to a debate in councils in Northern Ireland on whether it was appropriate to fly the flag on his birthday. People in Belfast and Bangor let us know what they think about the flying of the Union Flag on Prince Andrew#s th birthday.The Belfastspoke to people in Bangor and Belfast about the flying of the flag today.David Moore said it was not worth celebrating Prince Andrew#s birthday.He probably doesn#t really care whether the flag is up himself or not, he said. He has got bigger things to worry about than his flag being flown. Maybe someone conveniently forgot to put it up this morning.Shireen Symington said: I would not be flying it because I think he has let the Royal family down.In Belfast, where the flag was flying at City Hall, Alan Lennon said: “I think it goes deeper than that, it is not flying it for Andrew, it is for the Royal Family which I support very much. I would fly it for Andrew as well.There are allegations going about but nothing has been proven in anyway. I am happy enough for it to be flying today.”Brian Robinson said the flag should be flown as Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom.We are British, we live in the United Kingdom, it is our flag, we should be flying it, he said. Irrespective of anything, it is our country. He has not been charged with anything as far as I am aware. We have politicians who are in government who have done a lot of things and they are still in government.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Union flag flies over Belfast city Hall to celebrate the th birthday of Prince Andrew.Photo by Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Union flag flies over Belfast city Hall to celebrate the th birthday of Prince Andrew.Photo by Peter MorrisonAdvice put out by the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport told councils they can choose whether to fly the flag on so-called designated days. There are  councils in Northern Ireland, four of which never fly the flag and only Ards and North Down had previously chosen not to fly the flag today. Five councils are flying the Union Flag, some because they fly it everyday and others, like Belfast City Council, because it is still officially a designated day. Causeway Coast and Glens, in a bid to try and reflect the four council areas it was formed from, is flying the flag from some buildings but not others.The Union Flag is also being flown at Stormont.

Maybe you’ve had some information sent home from your child’s school or nursery  I had a great discussion with these children, most of whom did understand when to ask for help, what ‘not to do’ online but scarily some still thought they didn’t need parental controls, thought they ‘knew it all’ when, during our discussion it quickly became apparent that they didn’t. However, this discussion linked to how they used their tablet, when I asked did they have a phone or did they use their parents, I was shocked that most of them didn’t think the dangers on their tablet were also on the phone - nearly the whole class said they would use the phone to watch videos on YouTube or games that ‘popped up.’Gulp!At the end of the day, I was in another class and the teaching assistant explained to me that at the end of every day the children were allowed to watch Netflix for  minutes.I thought this was a treat but, no, it happens every day. Yes, they were watching Horrid Henry which is age appropriate, but I thought why couldn’t it be read to them  Gulp! Walking back to my car at the end of the day with these ‘incidents’ in my head, I saw a child from the class I had just taught getting into his car and being passed a tablet... why, I wondered, what happened to talking  Gulp! Then, now I’ve heard about these things but I really didn’t think any parent would actually do this, I saw a mum pushing a pram with a gorgeous little baby about one-year-old in it, with a screen attached to the handle bars. I thought, no, the baby can’t seriously be watching that, it can’t be on, it must be a fancy phone thing or something. So, I crossed over and deliberately walked slowly passed mumand was absolutely shocked to see what was obviously a child’s video playing, gulp! I drove home in a bit of a daze, reflecting on all I’d seen and heard, I even had a glass of wine instead of coffee when I got in! I really did wonder, and I do know there are lots of very conscientious parents out there, do most not take any notice of all the information about internet safety, about the dangers of strangers online, of cartoons and films with ‘dodgy characters and images popping up,’ about the danger of too much screen time etc  Do they think ‘my child knows it all, knows how to be safe’, ‘my child only watches a couple of hours and that’s okay,’ ‘my baby loves watching the nursery rhymes,’ googletag.cmd.push ‘I trust my child not to be friends with someone he hasn’t met,’ ‘my child needs the tablet to relax’   A few years back, the Greater Shantallow Area Partnership developed an amazing campaign called Screen Wise, which gave parents information about internet safety, the impact of too much screen time, about parental controls, cyber bullying and much more. I’ve listed a few sites below, and I’m sure there are many more, for you to find some of this information for yourselves - I know as a campaign it had a huge impact on everyone in that community, from babies to teenagers and adults too, so maybe you could start a wave of internet safety messages yourself - find a tip, share it on line and together let’s help all our babies, toddlers, children and teenagers enjoy their tablet, phones and internet and all they can offer. But always remembering ‘too much screen time is not good for me,’ for our lives are about living, about being social, about talking and playing together, not about sitting, zoned out for hours at a time on a machine. We have one le to share with our children, one le to love, so screens away it’s time to talk and play, oh and that means your phone is to go away too. Screen Time RecommendationsWhen I’m under two no screen time for me, and half an hour will do as I go from two to three.And an hour is plenty when I reach four and as I get older you can give me a little bit more. But remember and please, please, do… these times cover the whole day through! Sites For AdviceNSPCC Share Aware videos, tips and information - fab!

For Sams brave investigative journalism he was demonised by the DUP and threatened with legal action. However, Burned documents Stormonts endemic political corruption.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

He says: “It means lots of things in lots of languages.

But just one win in five league games since then and the league table is now taking a dferent picture, and it is not particularly palatable for Paul OKane, Richard McCarter and their players.McCarter said in the build up to Saturdays game against Bangor that the league table was to be avoided because of the psychological implications of seeing his team second from bottom, despite playing well in recent games. Four points on Saturday would change everything however – Derry would rise three, four or maybe five places, above Bangor, away from second bottom, away from relegation fears. They just had to win.They didnt.As Storm Denis raged across the skies, all Division  games were called off, bar two, with the Judges Road surface holding up. Unfortunately, that durability only suited Bangor, who used the conditions as part fo their game plan, and did damage in the first half that the hosts could not recover from. The absence of prop Sam Duffy was ultimately pivotal for the home side as Bangor used their physical superiority to dominant up front and get just enough points needed to get a hugely valuable win. That victory would have been much more emphatic o not for some heroic defending by the hosts, who also suffered from questionable decision making in their own attack which cost them crucial points at crucial moments.Derry could also look at some harsh refereeing decisions, but at the end of a day in which most things went against them, the celebrations of the Bangor players told its own story. They left the pitch drenched and muddied, but victorious, whilst not even a losing bonus point could console Derry, who will feel building pressure going into this weeks home game against Tullamore. Bad startEvery one of the  points scored on Saturday came in the first half and they came early on. Derry, despite knowing the huge importance of a victory, started poorly and were on the back foot from the start. Bangor had a strong wind pushing them on and they held Derry in their own  from the off, evengtually getting their reward for their strong start after five minutes. The visitors pressure told as front row Phil Whyte forced his way over through a crowd of bodies. Rhys Larmour converted and Bangor had the perfect start at Judges Road.To their credit, Derry responded in the best possible manner as they levelled almost immediately.The score owed everything to the hard work and tenacity of David Ferguson who took his team forward with a driving run. He was eventually stopped but offloaded to the lightning quick Simon Logue, who eluded a number of challenges before scoring right under the posts, giving Alex McDonell an easy conversion to make it -.That did not prove to be a precursor to a high-scoring game however, the deteriorating conditions making it dficult for both teams to showcase their attacking ability. It was Bangor who took control through sheer will and they put Derry onto the back foot again as they sought to restore their lead. Mounting pressure from the visitors saw Derry penalised and referee Keane Davison awarded a penalty try and the hosts had it all to do again at -.The half time break gave Derry a chance to re-evaluate their position and come again, but the worsening conditions only added to the challenge facing them. It was Bangor who had something to hold onto and they emerged after the break to take the game to the hosts again.Derry were better overall in that second period, but impatience and bad decision making cost them progression and momentum, while at times they had to dig deep to stay in the game as Bangor pushed them right back into their own  again. The defence at times was superb, but this was a game that they needed to win, and it just was not happening in attack, each small opening quickly shut down as much by their own play as by Bangor defending. It was an ultimately frustrating second half, and a result which has serious repercussions for Derrys season. There are now six games remaining and unless results improve Derry will have a very uncomfortable few weeks ahead of them. Tullamore visit Judges Road this week for a game which has now taken on extreme importance for the home side, who have to dig deep, not for the first time in recent seasons, to ensure that the club remain in Division C for next season, at the very minimum. At the moment, the weather is the least of their concerns. googletag.cmd.push TeamsCity of Derry: James Hamilton, David Ferguson, Quermy Wamerdam, Gerard Doherty, Criag Huey, Stephen Corr, Tiernan Thornton, Richard Baird, Ricardo Schneider, Alex McDonnell, Thomas Cole, Dennis Posternak, David Graham, Callum OHagan, Simon Logue. : Ross Harkin, Barry Laverty, Stephen Kelly, Neil Burns, David Lapsely.Bangor RFC: Phil Whyte, Andrew Shaw, JP Leary, Craig Burton, Michael Ferguson, David Bradford, Jamie Clegg, Mike Weir, Alistair Lockhart, Rhys Larmour, Connor Scallon, Zack Kerr, Mark Widdowson, Nathan Graham, Logan Norman. : Even Welland, Andrew Jackson, Andrew Smyth, Max Preston, Ryan Young.Referee: Keane Davison googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

He hopes, however, that he has allayed their immediate fears by stressing that he would not tolerate bad behaviour on his premises. He was willing to give a lead to stop it.He made the point to objectors that the ldquosinister element was already in the town and he did not want trouble any more than other shopkeepers or residents who had suffered at the hands of vandals.DOWNPATRICK mdash A young Downpatrick pop group has made a spectacular comeback on the local music trail after a two-year layoff.The former Sunbeams, now calling themselves Memphis, have been travelling up and down the country fulfilling engagements in halls, clubs and hotels.Ironically it was transport problems which forced them off the road in  but they have since been organising their comeback and are now better equipped and more experienced.Their repertoire is packed with the latest sounds and such is their wide selection of numbers that they played non-stop at alast month for five and a half hours.The group is fronted by the delectable and talented Janet Wilcox who is joined by her brother Stewart , Patrick McAuley , Danny Skeffingtonand Philip Hynds .Up to now most of their engagements have ben south of the border but they are now ready to make their mark up north, particularly around Co Down.BALLYKINLAR mdash Portaferry Dramatic Society will present the play lsquoIs the Priest at Homersquo  in the Parochial Hall, Ballykinlar, tomorrow night at pm.Written by the internationally famed Joseph Tomelty, himself a former resident of the town, the play is set in a priestrsquos home in a small in Northern Ireland during the early s.It is currently enjoying a very successful run in parochial and community halls throughout the Ards and Lecale peninsula, and indeed, in response to public demandperformances are being planned at some venues.Two of the playwrightrsquos brothers are members of the society, with Jim Tomelty playing the leading role of the curate.

Conor McKenna was influential in the centre of the park and he was dangerous every time he was on the ball trying to pick out the killer pass to unlock the Drumaness defence.Persistence finally paid off when Corey McCoubrey let fly with a superb strike that the Mills lsquokeeper could only parry and Brendan McShane was there knock the rebound home.Drumaness were a real threat from set-pieces and almost had an equaliser when a corner nearly caught out lsquokeeper Gerard OrsquoGormley, but the ball ped at his feet and the Mills strikers werenrsquot quick enough to capitalise on the mistake.The second half was much more testing for both teams as the weather conditions worsened and chances were few and far between with players barely able to hear each other on the pitch.To their credit, the Academy team kept plugging away, trying to stick to their game plan and they were rewarded when Karl Kearney came off the bench and was played in by Dagens.The young striker kept a cool head and calmly slotted the ball home giving the lsquokeeper no chance.The Bhoys were able to see the game out with a clean sheet and comfortably seal the league title with three games to spare..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Luke.jpg","title":"Luke boxing clever on way to major win  ","story":"A YOUNG Saintfield schoolboy is proving to be a knockout in the boxing ring.Eleven year-old Luke McAuley, who fights out of Ormeau Road Boxing Club where his father, Gareth, is his coach, won the kg title at the Armagh and Down Championships in Silverbridge, Co Armagh, on Sunday.The St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College student learned the basics of his trade at East Down Boxing Club before joining his fatherrsquos club and he believes he owes the coaches there a great deal.The latest in a long line of boxers from the McAuley family, Luke blasted his way to the title when he knocked out his opponent from John Bosco, Newry, in the first round of the final.This was his first ever competition, but he showed he was a real contender when he accounted for his Clonard opponent - in the semi-final.Luke is now back in the gym and preparing for the Antrim Open Championships in a few weeksrsquo time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister says it’s ‘too early’ for report on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"JUST weeks into her new job, Stormont roads minister Nichola Mallon says it is ldquotoo early to provide a progress report on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.South Down MLA Jim Wells had asked the minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure to provide an update on the scheme.His request mdash via a written Assembly question mdash came after local politicians agreed to seek an early meeting with Ms Mallon to make the case for work to start on the proposed poundm scheme.In her response to Mr Wells, the minister said that she recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.But added: ldquoUnfortunately, I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points. However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

Cecilia is on the wireless issuing a weather warning and my son is in the back seat asking mewe’re going to be late for school.By Jonny McCambridgeWednesday, th February , : am\"\"Parallel parking, easier to spell than executeWe may well be late. If we are it will have been caused by his insistence on wearing his Incredible Hulk pants today, a demand which led to a panicked last minute inventory of damp garments hung on steamy radiators. However, it seems uncharitable to mention that now so instead I just grit my teeth and tighten my grip on the steering wheel.I’ve almost driven past before I notice the gap between two stationary cars. On a dark, snowy morning a parking space near the school is as rare as a newborn with whiskers, so I hurriedly apply the brakes and put on the left indicator.However, as soon as I begin to reverse I feel something is not right, it’s an instinct which tells me that the positioning of the car is not quite as it should be. Perhaps I’m a little bit too far forward, or too far back. Or maybe I don’t turn the steering wheel far enough, or too much. I know from habit it’s wrong but I keep going.I attempt to straighten the vehicle and, to be fair, some of it is in the parking space. Unfortunately more of it is encroaching onto the road and blocking the flow of traffic. I look out the side window, I can see the footpath which I want to park beside. It’s definitely within walking distance. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...So I start trying to get my car closer to that path. I turn the steering wheel one way and reverse a little, then I turn the wheel the other way and go forward. I seem to be further from the pavement now.I try switching the direction that I’m turning the wheel. Now the front of my car mounts the footpath while the rear hangs out towards the middle of the carriageway, asI’m attempting some sort of audacious road-block.My son, in the back seat, is watching me. He is impassive.‘What are you doing daddy ’‘I’m trying to park the car son.’‘But why are you driving on the footpath daddy ’‘It’s all because of your flipping Incredible Hulk pants!’ I answer unconvincingly.Several minutes pass tortuously like this before I concede what has become clear, that I’m going to have to start again. I put on my right indicator and pull again into the busy school run traffic. The other cars stop and wait, growling impatiently while I steady myself, select reverse gear and try once again to execute the parallel park.But there’s an inevitability to my ultimate failure now. I’m flustered and a little embarrassed and my hands seem to have lost their dexterity. Conscious that I was too far out last time I over-compensate with the steering wheel and soon feel the bump as one rear tyre lts onto the footpath.I try to straighten up but, such is my panic, that I’ve lost the ability to distinguish left from right. I jerk wildly at the steering wheel and feel the bump as my second rear tyre mounts the pavement. Now the front of my car is hanging out in the middle of the road, forcing traffic to go round it.And then I just give up. Or to put it another way, my brain decides to close down. I’ve noticed this state of vacillation come over me before in moments of great stress. While my body is still in the car my mind has taken itself off to a sunnier place, a golden meadow where I’m playing with a labrador pup and picking daisies. It’s very enjoyable for a few moments, until a blast of a horn brings me back to reality. I look at my son in the back seat, his angelic features fixed on me.‘Why has your face gone so red daddy ’It’s not the fact that I’m not very good at parallel parking which bothers me, I’ve long ago reconciled myself to that failing. It’s the fact that I’m embarrassing myself in public. Again. I’ve convinced myself that everyone will be talking about me. Again.Back in my days of therapy I used to chat to a lot of counsellors who attempted to help change the way I think. If a brain tends to dwell on the negative then there are techniques which can be used to separate thought from emotion, fact from prejudice, to teach the mind to be less self-critical. Part of this is reminding myself that other people obviously have better things to talk about than my deficiencies.But on this morning, with my car jutting out onto a road at an unnatural angle and causing a traffic jam, it’s a struggle to believe that. Not only have I convinced myself that my pathetic parking will be all of the talk of the village for days, but I also fear that Netflix have already commissioned a  part series on the debacle, with Daniel Day-Lewis talked out of retirement to bring my tortured soul to le on the small screen.There is nothing  to be done but to abandon the parking attempt altogether, to find another space far away where there are fewer cars. Swaziland would be good.And so I drive away. In my rear-view mirror I’m sure I can see a granny parking a giant x in the same space on the first attempt. I drive around the corner and up the hill further away from the school. I park in a quieter spot, away from the constipation of congestion.I turn off the engine and watch some of the other parents rushing with their children towards the school gates. Their faces are strained against the weather and it’s obvious that they don’t notice me in . I relax because I can see things more clearly now. These people are not bothered with my deficiencies at parking or anything . They have their own lives. I doubt nowany of them are even aware of me, let alone discussing my parallel parking.Reassured, I step out of the car. My shoe slips on the snow and I slide painfully onto my backside in the middle of the pavement.A young mother has to stop suddenly to avoid treading on my head.I begin to vacillate again. I think I’ll just lie here in the snow for a bit.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce.

Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le. Organisations like CALM are the best defence we have against stories that end like Joe’s.”CALM runs a free and confidential helpline and webchat for anyone who needs to talk about le’s problems, available in NI and across the UK.‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ runs until February .\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay.

That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
