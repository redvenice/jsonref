Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist group because of its ties to PKK Kurdish militants in southeast Turkey.On Friday Turkish armoured vehicles drove across the border to join their Russian counterparts, according to television footage filmed from the Turkish side of the border. Around four hours later, they returned to Turkey.Ground and air units were involved in the patrol around the Syrian border town of Darbasiya, the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter, showing photos of soldiers studying a map and of four armoured vehicles.         The Turkish-Russian deal last week allowed Syrian government forces to move back into border regions from which they had been absent for years (pictured: Turkish and Russian patrol is seen near the town of Darbasiyah)                Soldiers stretcher someone injured and charred during the attack on the marketplace On Wednesday, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had information that the YPG, which Ankara sees as a terrorist group because of its ties to Kurdish militants in southeast Turkey, had not completed its pullout.Russia is the Syrian government\u0027s most powerful ally and helped it turn the tables in the country\u0027s civil war by retaking much of the country from rebels since 2015. The Turkish-Russian deal last week allowed Syrian government forces to move back into border regions from which they had been absent for years.         Ankara launched its offensive against the YPG following President Donald Trump\u0027s abrupt withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria in early October (pictured: Turkish and Russian patrol near Darbasiyah, November 1)         Turkish and Russian military vehicles return following a joint patrol in northeast Syria, as they are pictured near the Turkish border town of Kiziltepe in Mardin province, Turkey, November 1         Syrian National Army soldiers stand inspecting the remnants of a building gutted in the blast          Syrian National Army forces cover the body of someone killed during the bomb attack          Soldiers drive the wounded away from the scene of the attack as the injured clasp their bloody wounds         A child weeps from an upstairs room as she looks on the scenes of wreckage below Ankara launched its offensive against the YPG following President Donald Trump\u0027s abrupt withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria in early October. The YPG helped the United States smash the Islamic State \u0027caliphate\u0027 in Syria.Four Russian vehicles and a drone also took part in Friday\u0027s patrol, conducted in an area between 40 km east of Ras al Ain and 30 km west of Qamishli, a Turkish security source said.The source said patrols would extend further along the border strip and drones would be used to ensure YPG fighters had left the area.The source added that there had been no direct clashes with Syrian government forces during the incursion.         Overnight, the defence ministry said Turkey had handed over to the Russians 18 Syrian government soldiers detained in Syria near the Turkish border this week (pictured: Turkish military vehicles return following a joint Turkish-Russian patrol in northeast Syria)       Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey planned to establish a \u0027refugee town or towns\u0027 in a \u0027safe zone\u0027 between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain (pictured: Turkish forces)Overnight, the defence ministry said Turkey had handed over to the Russians 18 Syrian government soldiers detained in Syria near the Turkish border this week.The 18 men were seized on Tuesday during operations southeast of the Syrian town of Ras al Ain, part of an area where Turkey\u0027s incursion took place, stretching some 75 miles along the border to the town of Tel Abyad.Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey planned to establish a \u0027refugee town or towns\u0027 in a \u0027safe zone\u0027 between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, part of a project which state media have said would cost 151 billion lira ($26 billion).He met U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday and had said he would ask him to call for a donors\u0027 meeting to help finance Ankara\u0027s plans to resettle Syrian refugees in the region.\u0027I will say: \u0027\u0027You make a call for an international donors\u0027 meeting. If you don\u0027t, I will make this call\u0027\u0027,\u0027 Erdogan said on Thursday.         Ankara has said it plans to resettle in Syria up to 2 million of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees that it hosts (pictured: Turkish and Russian military vehicles return following a joint patrol in northeast Syria)         A man passes the wreckage of a motorbike as the flames reach as high as him after the bomb explosion today          Last week Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the United States would beef up its military presence in Syria with \u0027mechanized forces\u0027 to prevent Islamic State militants seizing oil fields (pictured: Turkish and Russian military vehicles return following a joint patrol in northeast Syria)\u0027If it doesn\u0027t happen, we will establish a refugee town or towns between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain,\u0027 he said, addressing a building contractor in the hall and saying he would ask him to play a role in the project.Ankara has said it plans to resettle in Syria up to 2 million of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees that it hosts.Erdogan and Guterres discussed Turkey\u0027s plan, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York on Friday.\u0027The Secretary-General stressed the basic principles relating to the voluntary, safe and dignified return of refugees. He informed the president that UNHCR (the U.N. Refugee Agency) will immediately form a team to study the proposal and engage in discussions with Turkish authorities,\u0027 Haq said.According to plans Erdogan presented at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Turkey would resettle some 405,000 people between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain.Erdogan said leaders at the General Assembly had looked positively on the plans but declined to offer money.\u0027We have for years hosted millions of refugees in our lands. The support we have received from the international community has unfortunately just been advice,\u0027 he said.\u0027The mentality that regards a drop of oil as more valuable than a drop of blood does not see anything but its own interest in Syria and everywhere in the world.\u0027Last week Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the United States would beef up its military presence in Syria with \u0027mechanized forces\u0027 to prevent Islamic State militants seizing oil fields.

He and his companions are waved through at Amsterdam and Newcastle without a second glance.In Holland, the party, who are making the ferry crossing in a saloon car, are asked if they are carrying ‘weapons, drugs or alcohol’. ‘Oh no,’ they chorus truthfully. They are asked to open the boot. Nothing there.A policeman approaches. ‘I can feel the intensity of my heartbeat increase,’ says a nervous Khurram. But the officer ambles past and Khurram makes it into the UK.It is not known how many asylum seekers reach Britain by employing such methods, but figures suggest that at least 34,000 came into UK last year, while about 223,000 went into Germany, 129,000 into Italy and 99,000 into France.Under the Geneva Convention, refugees seeking asylum have a right to enter a place of safety, such as the UK, clandestinely. And the routes and methods used can be extremely hazardous — as Asher, 25, an outdoor pursuits instructor from East London, discovered when he crossed the Channel, evading French and UK border controls, on an eight-hour, 70-mile trip in a tiny dinghy.Border Force deploys six patrol vessels and five cutters to ply the Channel, yet so far this year there have been an estimated 1,200 attempts to cross it illegally.          The Calais-to-Dover crossing is one of the most closely patrolled in the world. Yet Tony had no difficulty in smuggling through Alim, above, a hip-hop artist born in Sierra Leone who has lived in Britain since he was eight. Alim, hidden in plain sight under a blanket in Tony’s cab, does not even elicit a raised eyebrowAnd last December, Sajid Javid, then Home Secretary, declared a ‘major incident’ in the Channel after a spike in the number of migrants trying to enter Britain by water.‘I’m worried because the boat isn’t safe and there are rainclouds coming in,’ says Asher at the start of his journey. He is an experienced sailing, kayaking and powerboat instructor. Even so, he is frightened in the tiny vessel, which doesn’t even have a seat.‘To be crossing the Channel in this inflatable dinghy, even with small waves, is nuts,’ he says.Five hours after he set out, we see him in international waters, 35 miles from land, soaked to the skin and frantically baling out the dinghy. (Days later, an asylum-seeker died in an effort to cross the Channel by similar means.)‘The boat almost sank,’ he admits later. ‘The waves were so big. In open sea, it’s impossible not to be terrified. I was frightened pretty much all the journey. It’s one of the most dangerous ways of crossing the Channel.‘I’ve seen videos of the boats people-traffickers use. They are meant to carry four or five people but they cram in up to 25 and they’re only just sitting on top of the water. They’re so exposed.‘If you’re not experienced and don’t know what you’re doing, then God speed.’Asher is ‘sympathetic’ to people who travel to the UK in search of a better life. His grandma, 80, a retired cancer nurse, came over from Jamaica on the Windrush in the Fifties.‘She came because she wanted a better life,’ he says. ‘We only get one life. We are the lucky ones in a rich country with so many benefits.’I ask if he was shocked that he made the crossing, arriving safely in Weymouth, Dorset, without being challenged. He says he was not remotely surprised. ‘Border Force is doing its best but how on earth are you going to stop every yacht, dinghy or powerboat crossing the Channel?‘The border is massive. I’ve got respect for the people trying to police it but they can’t be everywhere at once.’Indeed, traffickers are trying to outwit the BF by crossing at less intensely monitored routes. Even so, British lorry driver Tony, 56, managed one of the most audacious feats of the experiment.The Calais-to-Dover crossing is one of the most closely patrolled in the world. Yet Tony had no difficulty in smuggling through Alim, a hip-hop artist born in Sierra Leone who has lived in Britain since he was eight.Alim, hidden in plain sight under a blanket in Tony’s cab, does not even elicit a raised eyebrow.Every lorry is checked at Calais, where there are both French and UK border controls. Tony is concerned that a heat detector will reveal he has a stowaway. But high-tech scanners are not used on his vehicle. Tony is pragmatic. ‘England is a little island and it can only house so many people,’ he says. ‘I’d like to help everybody but I’ve got to look after my own.‘As a driver, you’re fined £2,000 if an illegal immigrant is found in your truck.’While in France, Tony watches as asylum-seekers wandering near his lorry are led away by officials. Yet Alim, inches behind him, remains undetected.Tony is amazed. ‘You’re up against guards. You’ve got scanners, heat sensors, dog patrols, passport control. I never thought anyone could get through these checkpoints,’ he says.And at Dover — where checks are being made, but not on every vehicle — Tony’s lorry again sails through security unhindered.Astounded by the ease of what he has just accomplished, he observes: ‘There’s all this security but what did we do? We just stuck a guy behind a seat, put a cloth over him and got through.‘What we proved is that if even we can beat the system. If you’re well-resourced and have infrastructure behind you, it would be easy.’That is a sobering thought at a time when ruthless criminal gangs are exploiting the desperation of illegal immigrants.The Home Office has this to say: ‘The Border Force is intelligence-led and targeted at criminals who seek to break the law.‘All the iniduals in this programme were British passport- holders. When there is reason to suspect criminality, we carry out rigorous checks, as evidenced by the 50,000 detections and refusals at borders last year.’Smuggled starts on Monday at 9pm on Channel 4."},{"url":null,"title":"Societys king clubs bags 200m payday","story":"Share this article The 71-year-old, whose fortune was previously estimated at £650million, started his career in clothing, before buying the Caprice Holdings group for £31.5million in 2005.A flamboyant figure, Mr Caring paid £150,000 earlier this year to dine with Boris Johnson at his own venue, Mark\u0027s Club.

Back came a chorus of ‘England’ before Tomoshige Kabetani piped up: ‘South Africa!’‘I’ll have a word later,’ joked Prince Harry. ‘You might not get selected for the Paralympics!’Tomoshige, 32 explained that South Africa had been Japan’s last opponents in this tournament, hence his support for the Springbboks, before adding: ‘This year you became a father. We are so happy.’ At which point the whole group gave the Duke a round of applause.Dressed in a casual shirt, blue chinos and traners, Harry was shown around by power-lifter Eri Yamamoto, 36, who hopes to compete at next summer’s Tokyo Paralympics. Having been at the 2012 London Paralympics as part of the Japanese support team, she told Harry that she hopes that Tokyo 2020 can be a worthy successor. ‘London set the bar very high,’ she said.The Duke explained how 2012 had transformed public interest in disabled sport – ‘it’s just got bigger and bigger,’ he said - and he wished Tokyo well for next year.Harry also met a group of schoolchildren including Shiyo Sudo, 12, who said that he was ‘very handsome’ and pointed at his wedding ring. ‘I’m married!’ Harry said proudly, holding up his left hand for all to cheers and to hoots of laughter. Eddie Jones\u0027 side are favourites to take the Webb Ellis trophy for the first time since 2003. It\u0027s the first final since 2007 that hasn\u0027t included New Zealand.

Among the writers on its eclectic list are Eve Babitz, Colette, JG Farrell, Mavis Gallant, Tove Jansson, Olivia Manning, Janet Malcolm, Alexander Pushkin, Elizabeth Taylor, and Stefan Zweig. NYRB Classics celebrates its 20th birthday this year, an anniversary it marked last month with the publication of The Red Thread, a selection (edited by Frank) of extracts from some of its books.And yet the list is a success. How do the books reach readers? I used to say things like: can we pitch this as the old Sex and the City? But I don’t think readers are fooled. They know that the old Sex and the City is not the new Sex and the City. There is a way in which the series sells the series. What I mean is that there is a certain logic in our eclecticism: it has multiple entry points. People might see a book they remember having loved, pick up anew and that might in turn lead them to take a look at books, also published by us, that they’ve never heard of. They’re awakened by the project as a whole.How important is it to publish voices from elsewhere at a time when the US government is encouraging the country to turn in on itself? I’m probably deluding myself, but I think it’s very important. Our endeavour, and that of some other small presses, has thrived in this period because people have kicked against first Bush’s and now Trump’s America. They have remembered that there is life elsewhere.What is it that makes a book last?I am looking for a book that still has the power to surprise: not just shock effects, but some sense of lived experience that is still palpable. I tend to be interested in books that have some sense of historical horizon and occasion: the notion that, though this was another time, we can see our own time in it as well.People use the word “relevant” a lot these days. Must a book be relevant? I’m extremely suspicious of the notion. It seems to me simply to feed people back to themselves. The best art is often powerfully irrelevant. I prefer the idea of currency, which is not quite the same as relevance. A book that has currency puts our present concerns in a different but distinct perspective.Is it relaxing dealing mostly with dead authors? Well, you don’t have to deal with authorial vanity! It’s also true that other people have let these books go. We don’t have to bid the entire bank in order to get them.Does your job make you feel hopeful about the future for books and reading?Yes, and it goes on surprising me: the fact that people love this or that book.

Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit.

How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle.

I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

But, said OpenAI, “due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model. As an experiment in responsible disclosure, we are instead releasing a much smaller model for researchers to experiment with, as well as a technical paper.”Given that OpenAI describes itself as a research institute dedicated to “discovering and enacting the path to safe artificial general intelligence”, this cautious approach to releasing a potentially powerful and disruptive tool into the wild seemed appropriate. But it appears to have enraged many researchers in the AI field for whom “release early and release often” is a kind of mantra. After all, without full disclosure – of program code, training dataset, neural network weights, etc – how could independent researchers decide whether the claims made by OpenAI about its system were valid? The replicability of experiments is a cornerstone of scientific method, so the fact that some academic fields may be experiencing a “replication crisis” (a large number of studies that prove difficult or impossible to reproduce) is worrying. We don’t want the same to happen to AI.On the other hand, the world is now suffering the consequences of tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Uber and co designing algorithms for increasing “user engagement” and releasing them on an unsuspecting world with apparently no thought of their unintended consequences. And we now know that some AI technologies – for example generative adversarial networks – are being used to generate increasingly convincing deepfake videos.If the row over GPT-2 has had one useful outcome, it is a growing realisation that the AI research community needs to come up with an agreed set of norms about what constitutes responsible publication (and therefore release). At the moment, as Prof Rebecca Crootof points out in an illuminating analysis on the Lawfare blog, there is no agreement about AI researchers’ publication obligations. And of all the proliferating “ethical” AI guidelines, only a few entities explicitly acknowledge that there may be times when limited release is appropriate. At the moment, the law has little to say about any of this – so we’re currently at the same stage as we were when governments first started thinking about regulating medicinal drugs.In the case of GPT-2, my hunch is that fears about its pathogenic propensities may be overdone – not because it doesn’t work, but because humans have long experience of dealing with print fakery. Ever since Gutenberg, people have been printing falsehoods and purporting to be someone else. But over the centuries, we’ve developed ways of spotting fakes. Accordingly, machine-generated text poses less of a problem than video deepfakes.GPT-2’s capabilities are undoubtedly impressive, though. In a fascinating essay, I, Language Robot, the neuroscientist and writer Patrick House reports on his experience of working alongside OpenAI’s language model – which produces style-matched prose to any written prompt that it’s fed.It was, he recounts, an instructive exercise. “The language robot and I never wrote the same story,” he recalls. “It became, eventually, a writing tool, both as a curator to new ideas and a splint for bad ones. When, after a few months, I lost access to it, my brain felt like it had been lesioned. I missed it. I had found myself jumping into its head, asking what it might write as one would a human writing partner, which made me wonder: should I give it the same theory-of-mind, inductive respect as I give to other thinking things? Could I even help but do otherwise?”The most fascinating part of House’s report deals with his idea of asking the robot the same questions that George Plimpton asked Ernest Hemingway in his famous Paris Review interview in 1958. In reply to the question whether it remembered the exact moment when it decided to be a writer, it replied: “I don’t remember ever wanting not to be a writer. Writing had always been my way out. My escape. When I was a little kid, my sister was always coming home from school with homework assignments and I knew if I got hers and mine done early I could spend the next day’s lunch hour looking at books. It was the first time that I actually thought that being a writer might happen.”And when asked what it did when it got stuck, it replied: “It’s hard to say, but I would say that it would be better not to have a muse at all, to do all that writing you think is going to be good without any conscious control over what you do. It’s better to be totally in charge of your own actions.”At this point, the reader gets the eerie uncanny valley feeling: this is almost, but not quite, authentic. But the technology is getting there. Why, any day now it’ll be writing newspaper columns.The web ain’t the worldA good report by the Reuters Institute at the University of Oxford challenges conventional wisdom by finding that most people still get their news from offline sources.Culinary conditioning TheConversation has an intriguing essay – “How steak became manly and salads became feminine” – by Yale historian Paul Freedman.It’s a bot’s worldRenee DiResta has written an insightful piece on the algorithmic public sphere called “There are bots.

Rejoice! Now a long-established ritual of social media, to be “cancelled” or “called out” means to be subject to severe public contempt on account of some infraction against morality.It can spill into lost jobs, broken friendships and public protests ultimately, it amounts to an effort to declare the victim a non-person, someone intolerable to decent society. No appeals and no rehabilitation.Speaking last week at the Obama Foundation summit, the former president told his audience: “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly.”There was a tendency, he said, for the politically engaged – and he was particularly addressing those on the left – to trade in comforting simplicity and the dehumanisation of opponents. His comments hold a lot of gratifying truths, but the most important one is this: cancelling people feels great. “Like, if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn’t do something right or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself,” he said. “Cause, ‘Man, you see how woke I was, I called you out’.”For those doing the cancelling, it’s a righteous high, a buzz of benediction, a most holy moment of delight. Because when it comes to the call-out, we can all tell ourselves we’re doing it for the best of reasons.We want to build a better world. We want to help our fellow citizens correct their error and protect the vulnerable from harm. And how could there be anything mean or shabby about that?What a load of self-aggrandising bunk. Cancellation is an intoxicating blend of piousness plus power. The online pile-on is a kind of wild justice and participating in its scourging force is a tremendous thrill. Even better if you have the nous to harness and direct that outrage for yourself. The Twitterverse is studded with micro-celebrities of affront who have raised themselves to prominence on a tide of other people’s anger.If you have a particularly morbid fascination with this stuff, you can watch a portrait of one of them in the documentary Who Is Arthur Chu? (available on Amazon Prime). Chu leveraged a successful run on the US gameshow Jeopardy! into a respectable Twitter following, then segued into leftwing activism, targeting iniduals he deems harmful now, he commands several thousand dollars a time for delivering talks on subjects such as “toxic masculinity”.Chu claims to be motivated by anger against injustice. But when, in an unguarded moment on camera, he talks about what success means to him, he doesn’t refer to policy or social change: he talks about how he has nearly doubled his number of followers.Inevitably, given that he’s a beneficiary of the cancel culture, Chu is one of the most adamant when it comes to asserting that cancel culture is not actually a problem. For its leftwing defenders, the label is a politicised tag designed to delegitimise rightful critique. A widely circulated image from the webcomic XKCD sums up the position. “If you’re yelled at, boycotted, have your show cancelled, or get banned from an internet community, your free speech rights aren’t being violated,” says the stick figure presenting the voice of reason. “It’s just that the people listening think you’re an asshole and they’re showing you the door.”This is one of those arguments that’s true as far as it goes, but doesn’t go very far. What if there were an argument against yellingboycottingcancellingbanning that didn’t consist solely of claims to freedom of speech? (Obama doesn’t refer to free speech at all in his comments, talking instead about the power of conversation to change minds.)Another defence is to point to the ostracism of unarguably despicable figures as evidence that cancel culture is actually a good thing – a Washington Post op-ed last week cited the calling out of Harvey Weinstein at a recent public event and argued that “critics of ‘cancel culture’ really just hate democracy”.Well, maybe. But it’s possible to both approve the shunning of a man subject to widely accepted accusations of sexual assault and also worry about the adoption of shunning as a universal tool of activism.Meanwhile, on the right, there’s a comfortable certainty that cancel culture is a strictly leftish vice.The rightwing commentator Douglas Murray, invited on to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme to discuss Obama’s comments, described the quest for “wrongthink” as the purview of his ideological opponents. But it won’t be the left squirming in moral horror when someone dares to show up on the BBC sans poppy between now and Armistice Day. (Bonus: Murray got to play the cancel culture victim when the host Nick Robinson challenged him on his past remarks.)So the right has its cancel culture and pretends to abhor it the left, less hypocritically but more incoherently, digs in to defend the indefensible.Obama is, of course, correct. The pursuit of purity is not just a wound in civil society, it’s also the opposite of politics. “That’s not activism. That’s not bringing about change,” he said. “If all you’re doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far.” But he assumes here that people engage in politics in order to bring about change and I’m not sure that’s true.As political affiliation becomes more and more a matter of tribal identity, patrolling the borders of the in-group and singling out enemies takes on increasing importance. After all, it just feels good.• Sarah Ditum is a writer on politics and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3d1468bbdd7757923586d69deb2d66fe106de7a/3_401_5610_3366/master/5610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2acd789d8af5775cbbf6139543e96463","title":"is this the end for tv shows that goad vulnerable for laughs jeremy kyle","story":"Is it possible to be cautiously optimistic that the not-so-golden TV era of bear-baiting people in the name of entertainment is finally passing?The digital, culture, media and sport committee viewed leaked backstage footage of The Jeremy Kyle Show as part of an inquiry into reality TV, going on to condemn the programme’s “bullying methodology” and “complete abdication of the duty of care”. The committee was set up after the death of Steve Dymond (who killed himself after appearing on the Kyle show to take a lie detector test), and the suicides of two Love Island contestants. However, while television networks have long been guilty of putting “good television” before participant welfare, this is also about us, the viewers, and the wider culture of dehumanisation that made exposing and goading often uneducated, generally skint people feel like acceptable telly.This went far beyond The Jeremy Kyle Show. Over the years, even as the numbers of working-class actors have dwindled for lack of funds and opportunity, there seemed to be little about real working-class culture that couldn’t be plundered for television, with shows such as Benefits Street confirming sneering prejudices. While Kyle’s type of show called those being exploited “guests”, other reality genres started refashioning people as “cast members”.This culture of treating human beings as free or cheap, small-screen livestock hit its nadir with shows such as Love Island (watch them at it!), which was supposed to be fine, because – yay! – sunshine and bikinis were involved and contestants made money at the end.Other reality shows have been coarser, verging on pornographic, yet were still clearly considered appropriate to commission, film, broadcast and watch. All of which exposes a fundamental disconnect at the heart of collective morality. On the one hand, the recent use of nude images of US congresswoman Katie Hill to shame her was rightly universally condemned. Yet, in Britain, it’s become routine to film young, working-class people fighting, vomiting and copulating, with debasing footage that could haunt them forever.There’s still no shortage of such shows, particularly when you deep-e into the satellite television channels. However, things do appear to be changing and for the better. While Love Island used to be a high-profile part of the problem, now it’s evolved into something closer to a solution. Operating under the new guidelines, the most recent series was vastly improved, with a drastic reduction in exploitative sexual content.Elsewhere, while there’s still a cynical fascination with people on benefits (that grisly low-budget addiction to poverty porn that never quite goes away), there at least appear to be genuine attempts to enlighten people, rather than relentlessly pushing the scrounger angle. Moreover, not only was The Jeremy Kyle Show axed after Dymond’s death, ITV made it clear it would not be commissioning similar programmes. Am I imagining it or is the treatment of people, especially working-class people, on television becoming marginally fairer and kinder? It’s just a tragedy that people had to die before we got there.Sick of your body being objectified – how about getting rid of it? Apparently, there’s a switch from “body positivity” (celebrating bodies in all their shapes and sizes) to “body neutrality”, where you completely ignore your body, render it an intellectual-cum-emotional non-issue, and hope others do too.Recently popularised by everyone from Taylor Swift to Jameela Jamil, body neutrality means that you don’t have to worry about being criticised or sexualised – you can just be.That sounds emancipating, not least after a week when a Michelin chef in Leeds was criticised for requesting that waiting staff applicants send in photographs with their CVs (was he concerned their faces would shatter the crockery?).However, is there also a sense of feminist endgame to this? A generation of women so traumatised by unwanted attention that they’re actually driven to fantasising about not having bodies – physical presences – at all? Could this tie in a little too closely with that size zero nonsense of yesteryear, or even with food disorders where sufferers often say that they want to “disappear”?In terms of freedom from judgment, body neutrality sounds intriguing, but why should women have to go to the extremes of vanishing their bodies in order to feel free and be taken seriously?So Grant’s snubbing was inspired by Javid’s prior elitist behaviour. An elitist, furthermore, who went on to fret about – what exactly? The death of Shamima Begum’s baby in a Syrian refugee camp after Javid, posing as a hard-man home secretary, refused to allow the child to return to receive hospital care in Britain? Or, more recently, as chancellor, his refusal to carry out a thorough assessment of the economic dangers of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, claiming it was “self-evidently in our nation’s economic interest”?No, Javid is peeved that a celebrity refused to shake his hand at a film premiere. Perhaps Javidhe needs to get his priorities straight. Moreover, I cringed at the telling term “station in life”, implying that, in Javid’s view, it would have been understandable had Grant refused to shake the hand of a dustman. Again, who is the elitist?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3000f3e738fb34cd21db97d92dea688321a0366/0_56_3076_1845/master/3076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1614f92fa7db9d0764cd7196c07a284","title":"olivia wilde blunting the scissors of in flight move censors","story":"The Booksmart director is rightly up in arms about her film being edited by an airlineA few years ago, in an all-too-brief interlude between conquering a severe fear of flying and the advent of buzzkill flight shame, I settled into a transatlantic journey, stuffed with cheesy pasta, flanked by an adorable number of miniature wine bottles, and prepared to watch the ultimate comfort film, Bridesmaids.In my happy carby stupor, I had forgotten that it opens with Kristen Wiig jiggling around on top of Jon Hamm for far longer than the woman next to me felt comfortable with. I saw her glance over, and glance back, then repeat the manoeuvre, her disapproval silent but deadly. I looked down at my abandoned bread roll, hoping to convey the message that I was only there for Maya Rudolph’s food poisoning in a wedding dress. Somehow, to acknowledge it by turning it off would have been worse, so I left them to bounce on, unwatched, yet judged.Olivia Wilde directed Booksmart, 2019’s most joyous and life-affirming film, a righteous celebration of the brightness of teenage girls. Wilde had the displeasure of watching her own movie on a flight recently and I knew it could not be the same liberated airline that had provided my Bridesmaids incident. Fans had been in touch to tell her about strange and savage cuts that had been made to some of its most crucial scenes and, on watching it herself, Wilde took to Twitter to list them. They are extravagantly prudish, homophobic and sexist, which is particularly egregious given that one of the main strengths of the film is to rally against such idiocy with class and wit.It is wearying beyond belief to once again receive the familiar and harmful message that a same-sex storyline is disgusting, or porny, or NSFW, to be chopped out and hidden away. The implication that it is shameful is so terribly damaging. Wilde has urged airlines not to work with the third-party company responsible for the edits, which has enormous power in deciding what might be “appropriate”. Instead of coming for sweet, funny romance, it would have been far more useful for them to step in and tell me not to watch Avatar on a screen the size of a paperback.Judd Apatow is one of a number of creative types expressing disapproval at a feature that Netflix appears to have rolled out as a test to some Android users, which would allow them to adjust the playback speed of a show or series. “We give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen,” wrote The 40-Year-Old Virgin director. Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul also spoke out against the idea, tweeting that it “would mean they are completely taking control of everyone else’s art and destroying it. Netflix is far better than that.”The thought of being able to play something faster fills me with horror and not entirely because of the imposition on a film-maker’s artistic vision. It suggests streaming services are trying to expand our tired, bloated, binge-bent minds, so we can accommodate even more entertainment than we ever thought possible. I already feel regular prickles of panic about being behind on absolutely everything and there are only so many must-see series that one can actually see. Allowing them to artificially alter the notion of time so we can stuff ourselves with ever more shows will only encourage them to make even more shows and then our brains will explode.The Hove and Portslade MP, Peter Kyle, has written about his experience of having acute dyslexia, especially when it comes to communicating with people online, which, naturally, largely relies on the written word.“Twitter can be a pretty unforgiving place for people with unseen challenges,” he said, at the beginning of a long and honest thread explaining that when he got the spelling of “border” and “boarder” mixed up recently, he had been called “thick” and “stupid” and told to resign. He wrote about why he found some words trickier than others, discussed some of his techniques for dealing with that and criticised the “spelling police” who call him out and call him names.On the internet, spelling mistakes are often the butt of the joke. I got sent a Facebook post recently that was advertising homemade Christmas cacks. Never talk about hip-hop and miss the second “p” out of rapper if you’re going to declare that you love men’s fragrances, check your cologne is not your colon. But I once heard someone say that when we laugh at people’s spelling mistakes on the internet, we know that we are laughing at something else, and I know, too, that it can be true: it is a cheap laugh, usually at something far more than the mistake itself.Like many people of his age, Kyle recalls being put in “remedial” class thankfully, schools are now much better at recognising dyslexia than they were when he MP was growing up. His call for more understanding on Twitter might be like putting your head into a bear’s mouth and asking it not to bite you but even so, it is important to be reminded that an error is not always a simple mistake and that spelling is not an indication of a person’s intellect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48825651147a5299c13fec6918c0538656618e8/0_628_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8e6fa1a43734d72e1a05b8f709601c","title":"only in ottawa top 10 unmissable summertime experiences in canadas capital","story":"Summer visitors to Ottawa will be rewarded with a vibrant arts and outdoor scene, with galleries, festivals and waterways. Then there’s the beerOttawa is relaxed, but at the same time an adrenaline-seeker’s dream. It’s funky and kitsch and yet effortlessly cool with brewing, dining and arts scenes to rival anywhere in North America – and its absolute best comes in the summer months.Cruising the Rideau canalWhile Ottawa’s Rideau canal plays host to hundreds of daily ice skaters carving across its frozen surface during winter months, the Unesco world heritage site is just as appealing in summer. Jump aboard Rideau Canal Cruises’ fully electric barge – the only vessel of its kind in North America – and savour the perfect vantage point for some of Ottawa’s most scenic spots. You can take in Lansdowne Park and Dow’s Lake to the south and the gothic revival splendour of the Fairmont Château Laurier hotel closer to downtown.Political manoeuvring – with a twistZen can be found in surprising pockets of Ottawa but none more surprising than in its very epicentre – Parliament Hill. Inside the doors of the nation’s halls of power, things may be particularly frenetic with a federal election coming up this autumn, but on the lawn outside the stunning house of commons, things are decidedly more chill every Wednesday afternoon. The free weekly yoga class is an absolute must for yogis and non-yogis of all abilities. Even prime minister Justin Trudeau, an enthusiast himself, has stopped in at a class or two. Just bring a mat – and some sunscreen – and get your downward dog on while the politicians get their debate on inside.Brewing up a stormWhen former US president Barack Obama rekindled his bromance with Trudeau during a visit to the capital earlier this summer, it was pretty fitting that the pair caught up at a brewery. Ottawa is teeming with taphouses pouring out some of Canada’s best brews. Obama and Trudeau opted for Big Rig Brewing where they sampled the Canadian Amber and Alpha Bomb IPA respectively. But there is hoppy goodness to be found across the city. Beyond the Pale in Little Italy is a gem with great eats to soak up even better beers, while Canada’s first Kickstarter-funded brewery, Dominion City, is so worth the trip to the east end. Can’t decide between the options? Then let the experts at Brew Donkey guide you on an always-fun brewery bus tour.The best season? Patio seasonSummer is patio season. There’s nowhere better to enjoy those great local beers or some of the best cuisine in Canada than in the open air. The uber-stylish Andaz hotel in the ByWard Market may lay claim to the city’s best patio, a rooftop escape that offers stunning views. But there are scores of rivals. Tavern on the Falls boasts soothing waterfall views, while Tooth and Nail Brewing Co has a recently opened sun-kissed courtyard to go with great beers. The Brig Pub may have the most Insta-perfect open-air space of all – a canopy of hanging greenery that still leaves gaps for blue skies to pierce through.Sounds of summerThe capital reverberates to music all summer long. Bluesfest is the biggest and boldest festival of the summer and boasts much more than just blues. Headliners this year include the Killers, Alt-J, Wu-Tang Clan and the Backstreet Boys. But from June through to September there really is something for everyone: Escapade sates all EDM lovers’ appetites Chamberfest is the world’s biggest chamber music festival there are five days of fireworks at the Canadian Museum of History with the Sound of Light competition and, yes, there is also a 10-day jazz festival that features some of the world’s biggest acts.Please the palate at a walking paceOttawa’s food scene – a melting pot that bubbles over with flavours and aromas – is as erse as its population. The city ranges from award-winning fine dining to adventurous ethnic holes in the wall, with plenty in between. But there are so many funky new places opening up that wrangling them all in can seem like a challenge. So why not pass the job off to someone else by joining a walking food tour? C’est Bon Cooking offers great guides to the city’s food culture, snaking through the top foodie neighbourhoods. Centretown and The Glebe might be the most happening neighbourhoods right now.Waterways to pass the dayIf the blue lagoon part of the Goliath sounds appealing, but little else, then keep things upright and a little lower on the adrenaline scale by hitting the waterways that course around the city. With temperatures on the rise, the summer months in Ottawa are made for water lovers. You can take to the Rideau canal in your own personal vessel, with kayak, paddleboat, canoe and stand-up paddleboard (SUP) rentals all available at the marina at Dow’s Lake. Venture beyond the canal to either the Ottawa or Gatineau rivers. Urban Ocean may be the pick of some great rental and guide firms, offering the chance to SUP in the shadows of Parliament Hill or SUP yoga by the Ottawa locks.Live the high life … then dropNot everything has to be chill in Ottawa – there are thrills too. Nowhere does the adrenaline flow freer and faster than at the Rock. Just a 20-minute drive from downtown, this stunning limestone gorge is a site to behold but looks even better upside down. Great Canadian Bungee offers the highest fall on the continent of North America — fully 61 metres (200 feet) into the aquamarine lagoon below. Even the 49-metre (160-foot) rebound is higher than the next biggest bungee in the US or Canada! If you’re not feeling the urge, watching others drop below is a thrill in itself!Culture cravings satisfiedOttawa is not just the country’s political centre. It lays claim to being Canada’s museum and gallery capital too. The sprawling National Gallery of Canada finds room for almost 100,000 works, by a distance the country’s biggest. This summer’s highlight sees the world’s first-ever exhibition devoted to the portrait work of post-impressionist master Paul Gauguin. But make time for the Canadian and Indigenous galleries too, where the country’s cultural heritage can be traced back 5,000 years. At the Ottawa Art Gallery’s stunning new home – shared with Le Germain hotel – catch the Wrapped in Culture project, a powerful reclamation project between Indigenous artists from Canada and Australia.Go wildSo many summer visitors eschew Canadian cities and make straight for the great wilderness. Ottawa offers the best of both worlds. Drive even 10 minutes outside the city and you’ll find your natural paradise. Gatineau Park is over 350 sq kms of green goodness and yet its main entrance is just 4km from downtown. Hike to the Pink Lake lookout where the deepest aqua-green waters ensure that no filter is required for the perfect selfie. There are trails for all levels of hikers, and rookies and experts alike should finish up at the genteel 1900s surrounds of the Mackenzie King Estate, where tea and scones at the former residence of Canada’s longest-serving prime minister are just reward for the hike.Explore all Canada’s capital has to offer with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3f7e5e587883057275ab322ed2a7bab2cb8f88/0_200_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0934396a1fcb20fb5ccb680372b62200","title":"10 unmissable autumn experiences in ontario","story":"Visit Ontario in the autumn and you’ll discover food festivals, migrating birds and a kaleidoscope of foliage colour. Relax at Muskoka or fly to Frying Pan Island for its famous local fish and chipsOntario explodes into colour in autumn as the lush greens of spring and summer give way to the reds and golds and scorched orange and browns that are the hallmarks of the harvest time. The best time to see the autumn colours is from mid-September to mid-October when Ontario Parks publishes a colour report on its site of the autumn colours across the province. As you can imagine, the colours vary, depending on your location. In truth there is no better time to hit the road, get out of the city and soak up the kaleidoscope of change for a true Canadian autumn adventure.The natural heart of the provinceNowhere do the seasons change with as much vivid, coursing colour as in Algonquin provincial park. There are more than 100 provincial parks in Ontario, but none can rival Algonquin for popularity. Why? Because it lives up to the hype … and then some. Almost 3,000 square miles – a bigger expanse of land than Luxembourg – of unspoiled natural wilderness, the park is located between Toronto and Ottawa and is less than three hours’ drive from either city. Camp under the tapestry of stars or rent a ranger cabin for some rustic comfort. But, at first light, get out and catch the rich red maples and blinding yellow aspen trees in all their swing season glory.Pull up a chair in MuskokaIf Algonquin is Ontario’s natural centre, then the nearby Muskoka region is its relaxation hub. When Torontonians speak wistfully of a need to get out of the city to “cottage country” it’s likely that the Muskoka region is on their mind. From Insta-perfect tiny cabins to multi-million dollar lake homes, Muskoka has the full gamut of getaway options, almost all of them carving out a corner of tranquility among the pretty towns that pepper the region. A buzzing food scene, great breweries, spas and golf courses – the area has everything. Most of all though, it’s made for lounging lakeside in a low-slung Muskoka chair and forgetting about city life.Why 1,000 Islands make for a delightful trip …Head upstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach the 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and American border. A lazy but so rewarding cruise of the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence is not to be missed, with stunning seasonal views guaranteed. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originating here.… Or up the ante with 30,000 IslandsIf you’re a go big or go home type then please don’t go home. Ontario offers a supersized island experience on the eastern shore of Georgian Bay as speckled out from Parry Sound lie the 30,000 Islands. The largest freshwater archipelago in the world, the islands can be enjoyed on water or, if you’re in the mood to splurge, by air. Georgian Bay Airways offers outstanding tours of the Unesco biosphere reserve, including one that stops in at Henry’s, a fish and chip shop that serves up the local delicacy – battered pickerel – on the quite brilliantly named Frying Pan Island, which can only be visited by plane or boat.Give the Highlands a flingJust three hours north-east of Toronto, the Haliburton Highlands offer some of the most spectacular trails and lookout points in the province – especially during the autumn colour season. In late September the four-day Hike Haliburton festival is the largest annual hiking gathering in the entire country. As the tree canopy really begins to find its best burnt crimson, climb the Dorset Lookout Tower and have your breath taken away by the panoramic visions from the top. Once your trail is finished, rest weary limbs and quench that thirst at the Lake of Bays Brewing Company in Baysville to the west.All aboard for northern exposureThe expanses of Ontario that stretch northwest from Georgian Bay can seem intimidatingly vast. But they needn’t be. Sault Ste Marie, a steel town on the rebound with some real gems among the rebirth, is a great starting point for a northern excursion. The rugged appeal of northern Ontario may be best taken in on the Agawa Canyon Tour Train, a journey into the wilderness on tracks that hug the sides of lakes and traverse rivers on their way through towering rock outcrops. Just make sure to book a window seat.A capital ideaNot the provincial capital – that honour falls to Toronto – Ottawa more than makes up for it as the epicentre of national governance. But better to leave the indoor stuff to the politicians because autumn is arguably when Canada’s capital city is at its most charming. Take a paddle along the Rideau Canal (before it freezes over for the winter) to get the best views of some of the city’s autumn foliage.Feast on the fruits of harvest seasonYou can quite literally wade into the riches of Ontario’s agricultural output as harvest season gets into full swing. Strap up your chest waders and take the plunge in Bala, Ontario’s cranberry capital. Autumn fairs crop up across Ontario as the boundless bounty of produce piles up. From the Pumpkinfest in Port Elgin to Oktoberfests across the province’s south-east, tis the season to e right in. Food festivals are popular across the province, and run the spectrum from sweet to savoury. Anything from blueberries, strawberries, peaches, apples and cherries can be found. Ribfests, garlic, bacon fests or buttertarts also feature.Wine for the winding roadThe Bruce Trail is the longest and oldest trail in the country and winds its way more than 550 miles north from Niagara Falls to Tobermory, Ontario. An entire section of the trail snakes along some of the spectacular cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment and other sections along the route make for nice day hikes. It would be a sin not to visit during the Niagara Grape and Wine festival, a two-week toast to the region’s finest tipples in September. It’s Canada’s biggest wine festival and a Discovery Pass pairs the wines with some of the best of the region’s vaunted cuisine.Heading south before the next seasonAutumn is not just moving season for farmers. Some of Ontario’s native fauna are getting their act together too. Upwards of 300 bird species begin to pack up and head south to avoid the winter, while hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies do likewise. The great migrations are perhaps best witnessed at Point Pelee national park, less than an hour from the border with Michigan and the best time to catch the birdlife is mid-September.Start planning your visit to Ontario this autumn with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7b12462f58d578b58360f4db6e4dfb7c47d442/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce0bf1e7b7d972a2e08cb3c63c6475d","title":"from fringe theatre to walking on water 10 experiences that make alberta unique","story":"Alberta is a breathtakingly beautiful province. Home to the Canadian Rockies, farmland for miles (and miles and miles), all-season escapades, and a friendly and erse population, it’s a great place to get a whole lot of adventure for your moneyWalk on (frozen) water at Maligne CanyonStrap on your ice cleats and get ready for an afternoon journey through the frozen Maligne Canyon. During the summer months, visitors pass high over the canyon on a series of bridges, but once the river freezes over, the real adventure becomes possible. Trek over the ice and into the frozen depths of the canyon, and witness sheer icy cliffs on either side of the path – you’ll have definitely earned a mug of hot chocolate by the end.Become a fringe theatre fanatic in EdmontonFirst-timers at Edmonton International Fringe Theatre festival are often surprised to learn that Alberta’s unassuming capital city hosts the second-largest fringe theatre festival in the world (after Edinburgh). Those in the know, however, can attest to the massively fun explosion of wackiness and dramatic creativity that add colour and life to Edmonton’s hip Old Strathcona neighbourhood for 10 days each August.See Indigenous history at Writing-on-Stone provincial parkAlberta’s most recently minted Unesco world heritage site, Writing-on-Stone provincial park, is near the southern border in the area known as the Canadian Badlands. Tall, imposing rock formations called hoodoos populate the plains near the Milk River. On the rock walls are carvings and drawings that record the dreams and stories of the Áísínai’pi (Blackfoot) people, who have been in the area for the past 10,000 years. You need a guide to take you out to the art on the stone – book online to reserve your spot.Challenge yourself with the Crypt Lake Hike in WatertonThe trailhead of the Crypt Lake Hike in Waterton national park is accessed by boat, which is the first clue that this is not just going to be a walk in the park. Follow the trail up the mountain (approximately three hours each way) past four alpine waterfalls over a loop that runs roughly 11 miles. Avid hikers are, of course, drawn to the trail for the challenge of negotiating obstacles such as the 60-metre tunnel through the mountain – but it is the thrilling cliffside stretch near the top, which features stunning views down the ravine of the crystal-clear blue Crypt Lake, that truly makes this adventure something special.Photograph ice bubbles at Abraham LakeSometimes nature does some trippy things, like make a lake that freezes with bubbles in it. Decomposing matter forms methane bubbles in Abraham Lake in central Alberta. When it’s really cold, the bubbles get trapped in the ice rather than bursting at the surface. High winds can polish the ice and clear the snow away, making for perfect bubble viewing conditions.Go underground with a Canmore Cave TourJust outside Banff national park is the town of Canmore. It has all the trappings of a charming mountain community, plus a little extra: Rat’s Nest Cave. The name is straight out of a horror movie, but a tour of Rat’s Nest – one of Canada’s longest caves – is a perfectly safe way to get your thrills. Challenge yourself with the four-hour Adventure tour, or for something more moderate opt for the two-hour Explorer tour. If you are feeling extra adventurous you can book a private “solitude” experience.View larch trees in Banff and KananaskisEastern larches, a variety of pine also known as tamaracks, turn a deep golden yellow or rich copper for a short season – generally mid-September to mid-October – before dropping their needles for the winter. Pack a bright coat to pop against the colours in photos and head out to viewing hotspots like the Sentinel Pass in Banff’s aptly named Larch Valley, or the more easily accessible Chester Lake in Kananaskis country outside Calgary.Play palaeontologist at the Royal Tyrell MuseumDedicated to all things dinosaur, the Royal Tyrell Museum is Canada’s home of palaeontology, featuring one of the world’s largest collections of dinosaur displays alongside more than 130,000 fossils and an unbeatable programme of special exhibits and interactive learning experiences. Located just an hour-and-a-half drive out of Calgary, the Royal Tyrell Museum offers a great day trip out of Alberta’s largest city for people of all ages, not just kids.Touch the top of the world in Lake LouiseIf skiing isn’t your cup of tea, or you need a break from carving down the mountain, the Lake Louise Ski Resort offers a different kind of alpine experience – snowshoeing! Book a tour with a guide who will lead you off-piste for a peaceful snowbound hike around the summit, taking in panoramic views of some of the most stunning scenery in the Canadian Rockies from the spectacular vantage points dotted across the trail.Star gaze in Wood Buffalo national parkIn the far north of the province, with an area larger than Switzerland, lies the largest national park in Canada, Wood Buffalo national park. It is also the world’s largest dark sky preserve, making it the perfect spot to escape light pollution and star gaze or hunt for northern lights. With about 18 hours of daylight in the summer months, you will need to be a night owl to stay up for the show, or consider a visit in the autumn, winter or spring.So what are you waiting for? With all these fantastic experiences and so much more, surely now is the time to explore the vast – and vastly beautiful – province of Alberta.

One in August measured 2.9 on the Richter scale.Jeremy Corbyn described the move as “greenwash” and an election stunt. “I think it sounds like fracking would come back on 13 December, if they were elected back into office,” the Labour leader said on Saturday.“We’re quite clear, we will end fracking. We think it’s unnecessary, we think it’s pollutive of ground water systems, and also all the evidence from Preston New Road in Lancashire is it’s actually dangerous and has caused serious earth tremors.”The interventions came after the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, made it clear that the moratorium was only in place “until the science changes”.“It’s a disappointment but we’ve always been clear that we will follow the science … the Oil and Gas Authority is one of the world’s best regulators and they have said to us that we cannot be certain that shale gas can be extracted safely,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Asked why a permanent ban was not being imposed, she replied: “Because this is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom, but we will follow the science.“What we’re looking to see now is the exploration that Cuadrilla have carried out at Preston New Road, there will be some reports of what the potential is from those wells. So we will have better information in the future once that data has been assessed.”Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests,\u0026nbsplegal challenges\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspplanning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was\u0026nbspforced to stop work\u0026nbspat its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after\u0026nbspfracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government\u0027s fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking.She added: “It is quite clear that we can’t be certain. The science isn’t accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate and therefore unless, and until we can be absolutely certain we are imposing a moratorium.”Claire Stephenson from Frack Free Lancashire welcomed the end of the government’s “gratuitous” support for fracking. “Our position, however, is unchanged. We believe that only an outright ban is appropriate to protect the residents and the communities they live in, and our campaign will actively continue until one is implemented,” she said.Susan Holliday, the chair of the Preston New Action Group, also called for a total ban. “The earthquakes in August were felt by thousands of people. It must be clear from this that the Fylde coast is just not suitable for fracking,” she said.“It must be a huge relief for those communities that are currently under the threat of planning applications for fracking, knowing that they will now no longer need to go through what we have.”Friends of the Earth’s chief executive, Craig Bennett, hailed the move as a “tremendous victory” but urged the passage of new laws to enshrine an outright ban on fracking.“We must now ensure that legislation is passed so that the ban is made permanent,” he said. “But we can’t stop with banning fracking here if we are going to avoid catastrophic climate change. Time is running out. The UK must stop funding fracking abroad and we must leave all fossil fuels in the ground.”The Green party co-leader Siân Berry tweeted: “Banning fracking is for life, not just for Christmas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbcb92442a94af0ed00c7eee92b94d06886a8acc/0_284_5189_3115/master/5189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9a1e581b80ad950561d3d0d1c9315ba","title":"leonardo dicaprio calls greta thunberg a leader of our time","story":"Environmentalist actor says first meeting with teenage climate activist was ‘an honour’Leonardo DiCaprio has praised teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg as a “leader of our time” following their first meeting.DiCaprio, a prominent environmental campaigner, said 16-year-old Thunberg’s message should be a “wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over”.The Academy Award winner shared a picture of him and the Swedish student on Instagram, writing: “There are few times in human history where voices are amplified at such pivotal moments and in such transformational ways – but Greta Thunberg has become a leader of our time.“History will judge us for what we do today to help guarantee that future generations can enjoy the same livable planet that we have so clearly taken for granted.“I hope that Greta’s message is a wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over.”DiCaprio, 44, who most recently starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, said he was “optimistic about what the future holds” thanks to Thunberg and young activists like her.“It was an honour to spend time with Greta,” he said. “She and I have made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet.”DiCaprio is a vocal climate change campaigner and highlighted the issue during his acceptance speech at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016.He said: “Climate change is real, it is happening right now.

Ralls levelled from 12 yards to cancel out Kristian Pedersen’s opener, and Curtis Nelson completed the turnaround before Danny Ward saw red for a lunge. Despite being a man light Ralls added another but it looked like they would have to hang on when Ivan Subjic set up an exciting finish, only for another penalty to be converted by the hosts after Harlee Dean was dismissed.Huddersfield made it seven matches unbeaten under new manager Danny Cowley as they despatched Brentford at Griffin Park. The points were secured just after the hour mark when Karlan Grant fired a low shot into the corner for his ninth of the season following good work by ex-Manchester United players Fraizer Campbell and Danny Simpson.Sitting second in the table are Swansea City who needed an injury-time winner from substitute Sam Surridge at Wigan. Nathan Dyer opened the scoring for the visitors before Kieffer Moore netted from the spot, his first Latics goals since joining in the summer. With things heading for a draw, Bournemouth loanee Surridge converted a Connor Roberts cross.

Frank Lampard’s slick side have become a delight to watch on their travels and there was resilience to match their smooth football in the dying stages, ensuring that there would be no dramatic fightback from Watford after Gerard Deulofeu’s late penalty.Watford, bottom of the league and winless in their first 11 matches, could not quibble with Chelsea equalling a club record by recording a seventh consecutive away win in all competitions. Chelsea were dominant for long spells and moved into third place thanks to goals from Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic.Chelsea took control from the start and Jorginho did not need long to show why his name was being bellowed from the away end before kick-off. A player who was criticised for being too predictable when Maurizio Sarri was in charge has added far more urgency to his passing this season and he produced a delightful demonstration of his increased incisiveness in the fifth minute, carving Watford open with an assist that meant Abraham did not even have to take a touch before scoring his ninth goal of the season.Quite frankly, it would have been rude if the striker had ruined Jorginho’s artistry. It was a stunning pass, delivered with enough pace and bend to expose Craig Dawson’s slack positioning in the centre of Watford’s defence, and Abraham had the composure to give Chelsea the lead, dinking a lovely finish over the advancing Ben Foster.Watford’s hopes of containment were in tatters. The home team had lined up in a cautious 5-4-1 system but Chelsea cut through them at will at times and only a series of wonderful saves from Foster meant the game hung in the balance at the break. The Watford goalkeeper showed quick reflexes to deny Abraham a second, he leapt to his right to claw Pulisic’s header aside and he completed a hat-trick of brilliant stops on the stroke of half-time, springing to his left to tip Mason Mount’s thunderous effort on to the bar.It was a long time before Chelsea were inconvenienced at the other end. Watford, who suffered another blow when their captain, Craig Cathcart, had to be replaced by Adrian Mariappa, were missing Troy Deeney’s physicality in attack. The hosts did not do enough to support Andre Gray’s willingness to run into the channels, though they did offer the home fans a glimmer of hope when Gerard Deulofeu’s angled drive skidded inches wide in the 39th minute.There had been a couple of flickers from Watford and they threatened an equaliser at the start of the second half. Emerson Palmieri’s slip let Deulofeu skate down the right and the Spaniard found Gray unmarked in the area, only for Kurt Zouma to block the striker’s shot.Back came Chelsea, always dangerous on the break. Foster frustrated Mount with another excellent save but the visitors were finding far too much space behind Watford’s porous midfield. Willian, clever and alert on the right, fed Abraham, who assessed his options before drilling in a low cross that Pulisic converted from close range.The American deserved his goal. He had shown more desire than Watford’s feeble defence and it threatened to get ugly for Quique Sánchez Flores’s struggling side during the closing half hour. Pulisic almost scored a second, dribbling through on the left before forcing Foster to save with his feet, and Abraham was inches away from turning in César Azpilicueta’s cross.It was turning into an ordeal for Watford, whose fans turned on Flores when he replaced Daryl Janmaat for Kiko Femenía, but there was drama when VAR awarded a penalty after Deulofeu made the most of slight contact from Jorginho. Deulofeu picked himself up and sent Kepa Arrizabalaga the wrong way from the spot. Yet Chelsea escaped when Foster went up for one last free-kick and saw Arrizabalaga turn his header wide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad2e324be7a86c4820c2ce2de3f5f8ebf1e6551/595_22_1861_1117/master/1861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7c9a120fe082482fa39182f47517811","title":"watford v chelsea premier league live","story":"A rampant Chelsea were somehow restricted to two goals by Ben Foster ... who nearly salvaged an unlikely draw for Watford with a desperate last-gasp header!Anyway, that’s your lot. Jacob Steinberg was our man at Vicarage Road, and here’s his take on a fine Chelsea attacking show. Thanks for reading the MBM!Frank Lampard holds a post-match debrief with Sky. He’s very happy with his team, save a “sloppy” period just before half-time. He’s particularly pleased with his midfield engine room of Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho. Also the manner in which his defenders played out from the back ... though he admits they might have got “over-confident” just before conceding the penalty. But it’s been a good day for him on balance, with Arsenal drawing at home to Wolves and Manchester United going down at Bournemouth.Wow, Chelsea made a meal of that. They could, and arguably should, have been streets ahead. But they missed a fair few chances, while Watford keeper Ben Foster pulled off a series of heroic saves. Gerard Deulofeu’s cheaply purchased late penalty gave Watford a sniff of an unlikely point, and they nearly salvaged a draw at the death. Foster hugs Kepa as the whistle blows on a tale of two keepers. What marvellous entertainment!Foster comes up ... and nearly sends a ing header into the bottom right! But Kepa turns it away, the last touch of the match! Chelsea hang on for their seventh away win in a row ... and Watford remain rooted to the bottom of the table.90 min +6: Or is it?! Doucoure drives down the left and is clipped by Mount, who is booked for then kicking the ball away. A free kick. Watford load the box!90 min +5: Willian is replaced by James. Mariappa flings a long throw into the Chelsea mixer, but Dawson can’t get his head on it. Then Masina flashes one harmlessly wide, and that will surely be that.90 min +4: Willian is down, so Chelsea are effectively seeing this out with ten men. And there’s a game of head tennis in their area, Doucoure unable to meet Deulofeu’s right-wing cross flush. Yet again, Chelsea clear, though they’re in a big panic now.90 min +3: Deulofeu dances down the right, pushing Chelsea back towards their own box. But he can’t find anyone in yellow and black with his cross. Chelsea clear their lines again.90 min +2: Deulofeu and Hughes work hard down the right wing, but can’t prise Chelsea open. The visitors hold their shape with ease.90 min +1: ... and yet they’re now hanging on, the crowd having been energised by the announcement of five added minutes. Doucoure has a dig from distance, but his effort is blocked. How on earth have Chelsea got themselves into this position?!90 min: Batshuayi spins Mariappa and romps clear. He should score, but hesitates and allows Masina to come across and block. It’s really not clear how Chelsea have only scored two goals this evening. They should have had a hatful.89 min: Jorginho is booked for taking an age over a free kick out on the right. He’ll miss the upcoming game against Crystal Palace as a result.88 min: Batshuayi comes on for Abraham. 87 min: Deulofeu and the gloriously chippy Jorginho lock horns over something or other. VAR has a quick look but it’s deemed a lot of noise over nothing, grown men and all.86 min: Willian drives down the right. His low cross is nearly hooked goalwards by Hudson-Odoi, but the hosts clear.84 min: Masina attempts a shot from distance that’s at the very upper end of ambitious. And the ball nestles in the very upper end of the stand behind the goal. What a waste of good territory. Also a chance for Chelsea to take their sweet time to restart.83 min: Pulisic is replaced by Hudson-Odoi. A rare old atmosphere at Vicarage Road now, and we have ourselves a denouement!82 min: Dawson comes sliding in on Emerson. You’ve seen red cards given for challenges like that, his studs showing. But it’s just a yellow, and VAR’s not of a mind to overturn it. Well, well.81 min: Watford could easily have been on the end of a Southampton-sized humiliation, were it not for Foster’s heroics. But now the game’s suddenly in the balance! Football, huh.Deulofeu slams the penalty into the bottom left. Kepa with no chance!79 min: After an age, VAR gives a penalty to Watford! There was contact, even if Deulofeu went down in instalments. He’ll take the spot kick himself!78 min: Now the crowd are belting out the modern classic Fuck VAR. Preach on, everyone.77 min: Deulofeu goes down in the box after being tapped on the ankle by Jorginho. This one’s going to VAR. It’s a theatrical tumble, and a delayed reaction, though that doesn’t necessarily mean he’ll not get the decision.75 min: Janmaat is replaced by Kiko. It’s not a popular decision, and the Watford faithful launch into a rendition of You Don’t Know What You’re Doing. Po’ Quique. His second honeymoon period at the club hasn’t lasted too long, has it.73 min: Mount exchanges quick passes with Jorginho and has a dig from the edge of the box. He doesn’t quite catch it ... but Foster does. Chelsea look like scoring every time they go forward.71 min: Some space for Janmaat down the right. He reaches the byline and stands one up for Hughes in the centre. Hughes is free, ten yards out, but his attempt to connect head to bouncing ball is both strange and not very good.70 min: Nothing comes of the set piece, though Jorginho comes together with Hughes on the edge of the box, and he’s after a penalty. He’s not getting it. There is some official action soon after, though, as Janmaat is booked for a silly slide on Pulisic.69 min: Chelsea play their way out of a tight spot at the back. Mount should spring Pulisic clear, but overhits the pass. No matter, because the visitors are soon coming back at their hosts. The increasingly influential Kovacic twists down the middle and dinks forward for Abraham, who turns on a sixpence and nearly gets a shot on target. Instead, the ball’s deflected away for a corner.67 min: Hughes comes on for Chalobah.66 min: Chelsea ping it around, and their fans enjoy every kick.64 min: Willian causes more bother down the right. He cuts back for Kovacic, who shoots towards the bottom left. The ball flies wide, though Abraham isn’t far away from turning the poor effort into a successful cross, an inch or so shy of poking home from six yards. Goal kick. This isn’t going to end 0-2, surely not. More goals to come.62 min: Willian slips Azpilicueta clear on the overlap down the right. The Chelsea captain stands one up. It’s half cleared, but drops to Kovacic on the edge of the box. The resulting shot whistles straight down Foster’s throat. Sure, Watford might not be the toughest opponents ... but even so, Chelsea are really good to watch in full flight.60 min: That’s Foster’s fifth fine save of the evening. You couldn’t really fault him had he let all those chances past. This could have been a very embarrassing scoreline. It still might be, because Chelsea don’t look in the mood to stop piling forward.58 min: Willian has the wind in his sail. He goes on a blistering run down the right, but can’t quite find Pulisic with a diagonal pass. Then Kovacic drives down the middle ... and he does find Pulisic, sending him into the area down the left. Pulisic’s low shot across Foster is heading into the bottom right. But the keeper sticks out a leg to ert.57 min: That will have been a sickener for Watford, who had attacked with positivity since the restart. It’s an uphill task now, though. Another week spent rock bottom looks likely.Willian drives forward down the centre. He slips a ball to his right for Abraham, who squares it across goal. Pulisic arrives to slam home from six yards. Easy as that. Four in two for the young American!53 min: In an attempt to win a 50-50 challenge in midfield, Dawson spins Abraham around in a headlock. Free kick, though he’s pretty fortunate to escape a booking.52 min: Willian is down complaining after being legitimately whacked by a hard-tackling Chalobah. He should be OK to continue, though.50 min: Watford deal with Pulisic’s corner easily. Foster has been immense tonight. Watford would be getting ked without him.49 min: A stunning pitch-long move by Chelsea, started by Pulisic near his own left-hand corner flag. Willian scampers towards the Watford box and feeds Mount to his left. Mount pearls a shot goalwards, but it’s parried well by Foster. It’s a corner.47 min: Emerson takes a fresh-air kick and allows Deulofeu to make good towards the Chelsea box down the right. Deulofeu slips the ball across to Gray, who looks like having a free crack from the penalty spot ... but out of nowhere comes Zouma, sliding across to block at the very last second! That was Watford’s best move of the match, but what sensational defending by Zouma to deny them an equaliser.46 min: Emerson and Pulisic combine neatly in the middle. The former bursts into a lot of space, and is cynically clipped by Kabasele, who is booked for his trouble.Watford get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes.Half-time reading. Here’s how the two teams currently above Chelsea did earlier this afternoon. Plenty of late drama just a click away!After going behind early doors to Tammy Abraham’s fine goal, Watford have done well to stay in this game. Having said that, without Ben Foster, they’d be four goals down. As things stand, Chelsea will rise to third place this evening.45 min: A free kick for Watford out on the right. They load the box. Deulofeu whips it in, but Mariappa can’t get a decent connection on his header. There will be one added minute.43 min: Mount dribbles sensationally around a couple of challenges on the left, real ball-glued-to-boot stuff in a tight spot. He then launches an equally wonderful shot towards the top right from 25 yards. Foster gets a fingernail to it, and erts it from the corner onto the underside of the bar and out! That was top-drawer football all round. What a save (pt.III in a continuing series)! But what a talent Mount is.41 min: Watford are beginning to create proper chances now. Deulofeu’s cute flick down the right allows Doucoure to make his way towards the Chelsea box. His shot isn’t all that, and easily deflected away from danger. This is a brave effort by Watford after their dreadfully slow start.39 min: Deulofeu wins a corner down the right. Chelsea half clear the set piece, but Deulofeu is able to come straight back at Chelsea, dribbling at pace down the same flank, cutting inside, and lashing a low diagonal shot inches wide of the left-hand post. A decent effort, although he’ll be annoyed not to have hit the target at the very least.38 min: Pulisic attempts to release Abraham down the middle with a basic hoof, and nearly succeeds, but Dawson battles hard and Foster is able to deal with the situation.36 min: Pereyra feeds Doucoure down the right. Doucoure’s low cross, intended for Gray in the middle, is blocked by Emerson. Watford are at least finding some good areas now, even if they’re yet to seriously work Kepa.35 min: ... nothing happens. They faff about with a short corner, and suddenly the ball’s shuttled all the way back to Kepa! What total nonsense.34 min: Pulisic slides a pass down the inside left for Mount, who reaches the byline and cuts back, hoping to find Willian. Watford bundle the ball out for a corner on the left. From which ...32 min: Watford are working their way into this now. Pereyra nearly releases Deulofeu with a long rake down the right, but his team-mate can’t bring the ball down. Then Gray is sent scampering along the left. He doesn’t back himself against Zouma and turns tail. But the crowd are a little happier now, as Watford spend a bit of quality time in the Chelsea half at last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3934ff00b1dfdd8d4e03090e61f427aadd7af0b5/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1949d50859e1028a0de3ce849d962cd 700w","title":"blind date allegra charlie","story":"What were you hoping for?A fun time, good food and an interesting story.What did you talk about?The Bristol food scene, cooking, dentistry, his lawyering, how we are both sarcastic and the awkward situations it gets us into.

I won my first national championship when I was 12, and my second, in a different class, when I was 15. The following year I progressed to racing single-seater cars. It was a struggle. Motor sport is really expensive and my family didn’t have the money, but we managed to find some sponsorship.I had some successful years in the Formula BMW UK Championship and got nominated for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year award at the age of 19, which I went on to win. That was quite a turning point. The prize included a test drive in a McLaren F1 car. That first test went really well and I signed for the team as a test driver at the end of the year.In the early 2000s, test drivers did a lot of track testing. Nowadays, that’s quite limited. Access to the cars is difficult and the race drivers themselves want to track-test as much as possible. But, most years, I’ve been fortunate enough to drive the car for a couple of days at least. Most of my time at McLaren is spent driving the simulator in the team’s factory in Woking. In the short term, it’s about working on the car’s set-up for the next race. In the medium term, it’s working on developing the car through the season. And then there’s the long term, adapting the design of next year’s car within any new regulations that are coming in.I studied engineering at Cambridge, and have always been interested in the technical side. You get to see the developments and innovations first-hand – they all come through the simulator before the car is manufactured. Other test drivers are maybe less interested in this aspect. Perhaps my fascination for it is why I’ve been a test driver for 10 years I’m one of the longest-standing in Formula One.It’s important for a race driver to have someone they believe in. Every time a new driver comes in, they want to understand your role and to trust that you’re improving the car for them. And you need to understand what they want from the car. At each post-race debrief, we listen back to the drivers on their radios to hear their feedback.As a kid, racing in Formula One was obviously the dream. Being a test driver can be a route to one of the racing spots in a team – you always hope you have the chance to step up one day. But there are few opportunities. There are only 20 seats in a season – it’s a very tough environment. It won’t happen for me now.At the same time as testing for McLaren, though, I have been able to develop my career as a race driver. I’ve raced across many formulas, including Formula Three and GP2. I’ve also won the Le Mans 24-Hour race in the LMP2 class. I currently race in Formula E, the class that solely uses electric-powered cars, so I still carry a dream of becoming a world champion. McLaren have been very flexible in working around my racing schedule: they think it’s good for me to be race-sharp.I feel very proud to have made a career out of motor sport. Many of the guys I used to race didn’t even progress from karting. Even if I didn’t quite reach the pinnacle of Formula One, being a test driver for one of the top teams has been the next best thing.I didn’t start out understudying – I did a lot of ensemble stuff and had some lead roles. But the bigger the productions that I’ve worked on since, the more understudying work I’ve done. I was the understudy for the role of Hermione Granger, played by Noma Dumezweni, in Harry Potter And The Cursed Child for three and a half years. Over that time, I was Hermione on just eight occasions.I’ve just finished a run in a production of The Color Purple. I had a featured role as Darlene, but was also an understudy for the part of Shug Avery. I had an understudy for my featured role and so, if I needed to become Shug Avery, my understudy would step up. Having both a featured role and being an understudy in the same production is really common most understudies have responsibility elsewhere.Nobody becomes an actor to be an understudy. We’re all ambitious, but you have to be patient. A standard West End production will have eight shows a week, spread over either five or six days. We are required to be at the theatre for every performance – even if we’re just sitting in our dressing rooms. There are always ways to keep yourself busy and engaged off stage. During my time at Harry Potter, when not on stage in my ensemble role, I would regularly work on the script and the character of the role. I’d also watch the show from the wings to stay as connected as possible. If you need to go on, you need to be there.You might not have the same level of contact with your director as the principal actor, so you’ve got to be really on the ball. You always have to be at the point of emotional and physical preparedness, in order to go on at the drop of a hat. Your adrenaline levels are always high. You’ve got to keep sharp and stimulated, too – boredom can have a huge impact on you psychologically. I know people who study for degrees in their dressing room. In fact, I did my master’s in music while understudying.Do understudies get on with lead actors? Everyone is different sometimes personalities knit nicely together, other times they don’t. But generally speaking, a company of actors will endeavour to work well together for the good of the production. I’ve always been fortunate enough to work in that way.I’ll look back fondly on my understudy days, without a shadow of a doubt. Being an actor is not just about the role itself – it’s about the company, the project, the content. Understudying has taught me about self‑belief. You need to have a heck of a lot of it – and those lessons filter into the rest of your life.I started doing standup in the late 90s, in exactly the same way that every other comedian does – clubs, open spots, gigging all over the place. But I worked out early on that compering was something I could do, too. In 2004, there was a Channel 4 show, Kings Of Comedy, where standup comedians lived together in a Big Brother-style house. Every week they’d do a gig and the least good person would be evicted. Beforehand, the production team wanted to see how a comedy club worked and, because it was being made in Bristol, they came to see one of the nights I compered. When they started doing the live eviction show, hosted by Russell Brand, they asked me to do the warm-up.I did a few more warm-ups the following year, and then Deal Or No Deal started, which I did for more than 10 years. I now do a lot of shows. I’m the warm-up on Have I Got News For You, Vic \u0026amp Bob’s Big Night Out, The Last Leg, and loads more.The core task of warm-up is the same as standup: it’s communicating with people – making them comfortable, making them laugh. The job is a combination of standup, cabin crew and holiday camp redcoat. A lot of it is housekeeping, so I try to find the funniest way to do it. I have jokes about every element of the studio experience: health and safety, fire exits, mobile phones. I joke about getting a young person to turn off your mobile phone for you, about drug dealers and doctors having a night off, about teenagers struggling to go two hours without Instagram. There’s lots of admin. There’s getting the right shots for the director, and there’s making sure the audience aren’t worn out before the show begins. I sometimes need to slow them down, because I want them to still have energy in four-and-a-half hours’ time.With standup, the crowd has come to see you, or at least a night you are part of. With warm-up, you’re not an expected part of the evening – you’re an appendix or footnote. It’s not the place to experiment with quirky material – the warm-up has to fit with the tone of the show.If there’s a break in the recording, you have to plug the gap one skill I have is that I can just talk for ever. I’m happy discussing the perfect burger or the best biscuit or my favourite service station ad nauseam – I think I’m a naturally funny person. Once, on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, I was told I only needed to do five minutes, because everyone was ready, but the floor manager came up to me and said, “There’s a problem. Someone’s refusing to sign a contract.” And I was on for an hour.Lots of other people who do warm-up aren’t comics they may have come from cruise ships or holiday camps. There are a few standups on the circuit who do warm-up, but not many enjoy it, as the ego has to be left at the door.If I met someone at a party, I’d still describe myself as a standup. I’ve got a gig in Halifax later this week, sandwiched between doing Pointless today, The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice on Sunday and 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown on Monday. It’s a varied life and I’ve done warm-ups around the world: in Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Rio. It’s lovely to be a full-time comedian and I’m really well-paid. I’ve got standup friends who are now superstars – I used to live with both Russell Howard and Jon Richardson. But I’m very happy where I am. Whatever level you’re at in comedy, there’s always someone above you, so you have to find a place where you’re at ease. And I am considered one of the best at what I do, even though it’s quite niche. When Richard Osman introduces me to people, he says, “This is Mark Olver. He’s the best warm-up in the world.” I would never say that myself, but I’m glad that he does.I’ve been a goalkeeper since I started playing football at the age of five with the local boys’ team in Edinburgh. I joined Bristol City in the summer of 2018, but only turned professional this summer. Last season I was combining football with studying ancient history at university. But that went a bit sideways as I was spreading myself too thin, so I decided to leave uni and focus on football.I made two appearances for the first team last season: one in the Continental Tyres League Cup and one in the FA Cup. The Conti Cup game against Aston Villa was played in torrential rain. We were winning 4-0, but I slipped in the mud and they scored. Not a dream debut. But we won the FA Cup game 3-0, so it was relatively easy.During the week, I do the same training and gym sessions as the first-choice goalkeeper, Sophie Baggaley. The only difference is that, at the weekend, I’m on the bench and Sophie is on the pitch. I’m sitting down and she’s standing up.There’s a danger that, knowing the chances of actually playing on Sunday are low, you just go through the motions. You’ve got to motivate yourself. There could be an injury at any moment and you’d be in at the deep end. It’s hard to feel ready, and keep feeling ready, for something that’s probably not going to happen. It can be quite isolating. Outfield players can at least come on for five or 10 minutes at the end of the game, but with goalkeepers it’s all or nothing. It’s tough: it can make you feel as if you’re not part of the team.You can’t wish ill on the first-choice keeper though. I respect that Sophie’s better than me and we are great friends, despite us vying for the same spot. Maybe if you didn’t get on with the first-choice keeper, you’d go to the coach and shout about it: “Why am I not playing?”Because they don’t get game time, understudy goalkeepers have to show the best of themselves in training. That’s their audition. I don’t have to dislodge Sophie this year. At the end of my 12-month contract, it won’t be “Eartha’s not number one, so she’s out” it’s more that I have to be pushing myself and pushing Sophie – blurring the line between the number one and number two. The club want the best goalkeeper, regardless of who that is. It can be hard to maintain concentration and motivation to prove myself every day when, more than likely, at the end of the week I won’t be the one who’s playing. But if I decide to stop trying, I will be damaging Sophie’s chances of improving, too.This year will hopefully be the year I can really kick on. I have international ambitions, too. I’ve played for Scotland under-19s, and I want to play in the World Cup for the full side. A couple of years ago, I nearly lost both my legs. I got compartment syndrome. During a fairly routine operation for a health condition, there was a problem with oxygen flow getting to the muscles and they began to swell up and up. If not operated on in time, compartment syndrome results in the breakdown and death of your muscles. I had to sign a form giving the surgeons permission to amputate if the operation went wrong. I was a footballer and my life was in my legs. I had to have numerous surgeries to repair the injury and spent a good bit of time on crutches. Nearly losing the opportunity to play football changed my outlook. Even if I’m just sitting on the bench, I still think that’s a huge achievement.I went to art college. Everyone there pretends to be a painter or a sculptor, but it’s just a way of getting into bands. We described our band as punk-skiffle, a description we made up, because it fitted what we did: you played whatever instrument you were given or had found in a skip. We made a godawful racket. We were technically appalling, but we had the enthusiasm of youth.We were doing gigs around Leeds, but I had some friends who were in a band called Cud and they were doing a fair bit better they were gigging beyond Leeds and getting John Peel sessions. One day they had a gig in Preston and they were looking for someone to drive them. “Can you drive?” “Yes.” “Can you hire a van and drive us to Preston?” “Yes.” “We’ll give you £10 for it.” “Yes!”So a driving licence was the most important qualification I ever got. Then it became, “Can you set the amps up? Can you tune the guitars?” Cud started playing bigger gigs in bigger venues and you’d bump into other bands on the road. They’d say, “Oh, we need someone, too.” Before I knew it, it was a job.I’ve been working with Richard Hawley for about 12 years. Anywhere he has to plug in a guitar – including in-store shows or TV and radio appearances – I’ll be there. I can do a couple of weeks touring with him and then come back and get on with things in my workshop. We’re all of a certain age and we’ve all got kids and families. None of us are remotely interested in the one‑and-a-half-years-away-from-home thing.On tour, a big chunk of the day will be spent setting everything up on stage: amps, pedals and the like. Richard uses four amps and about 30 pedals. They surround him in a semi-circle – an arc of guitar noise. He also uses about 12 guitars per gig it’s virtually a guitar change with every song. Once the PA is set up, I tend to do a soundcheck by having a go on a couple of the guitars, making a bit of a racket and making sure all the pedals do what they should be doing. I need to make it sound the same as it did the night before – what I heard when I stood in the middle of that arc of noise 24 hours earlier.Through working with Richard, I ended up working with Duane Eddy, as his guitar tech when he comes to the UK. I’ve also worked with the Cure, Joe Strummer, Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds, Tindersticks and Embrace.If you’ve been in a band, you always regret packing it in. Life gets in the way and you have a mortgage to pay. But I couldn’t contemplate being able to do what Richard does: his skill as a songwriter, singer and guitarist is at such a level. Richard needs me, and I need him, but I don’t think he could do my job, and I certainly couldn’t do his. If something terrible happened and Richard couldn’t do a gig one night, but they decided to go ahead with me in his place, I think there’d be a lot of people asking for their money back.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/557117279917c4cd59e6f2a49a9f058fa3bac11a/324_1084_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2abf8b2e33fc646c1572ecc8ad504d4","title":"thurston moore i was a nerd and a dork at school","story":"The musician, 61, talks about hanging out in record stores, meeting his heroes and why he wants to write a 24-hour songI was not a cool guy at school.

Or it could just be that you have followed the long career of Rupert Murdoch.Now David Dimbleby, the broadcaster who has watched the life and times of the Australian media mogul for over five decades, will separate fact from fiction in a podcast that chronicles the real Murdoch story. It will launch on Audible later this month and will be 81-year-old Dimbleby’s first journalistic work since stepping down from the helm of BBC’s Question Time programme last year.“I first interviewed Rupert Murdoch for Panorama when he bought the News of The World in 1968 and then again when he bought the Times,” said Dimbleby this weekend. “I have always been fascinated by his risk-taking, buccaneering approach to newsgathering and the use of that power to influence public attitudes.”The influence of Murdoch has been felt behind the scenes in newspapers since he came to Britain aged 38. He has also repeatedly made the headlines. Just last week the 88-year-old’s name became part of the Labour leader’s election pitch to the British public. He still presents, Jeremy Corbyn said, a key problem to be tackled after a Labour party victory.Away from Westminster Murdoch remains a talismanic figure of hate for some as a result of the phone-hacking scandal that rocked the newspaper industry in 2011.“The podcast I have made explores the controversial use of the media he owns to exert political power,” said Dimbleby, of The Sun King, which will launch on 18 November. “From the Sun to Fox News I look at his motives and methods through the eyes of his colleagues and opponents. I know a great deal more about him now than I did back in 1968, but he remains an enigma.”The makers of the HBO TV hit Succession, created by British writer Jesse Armstrong and co-written by playwright Lucy Prebble, claim the show was not inspired directly by Murdoch. Other business empires of the super-rich, they say, have been folded into the mix. But many of the issues facing fictional father figure Logan Roy, played by Cox, are immediately recognisable. He, like Murdoch, must shift with media trends and handle the competing ambitions of his children.Dimbleby, who himself comes from a newspaper-owning family, if on a smaller scale, will tell how Murdoch turned the Sun from a cautious broadsheet into Britain’s most widely read tabloid newspaper.The podcast will follow Murdoch to America where he took on the New York Post and explore his controversial war against the British print unions at Wapping. Media dominance under Margaret Thatcher helped Murdoch gain unprecedented access to power. But Dimbleby says The Sun King will also cover “the media mogul’s lowest moment”: the phone-hacking scandal. It will look at the origins of Fox News in 1996 and its part, two decades later, in supporting the rise of Donald Trump.The chance to follow one significant story in the podcast has been welcomed by Dimbleby in stark comparison to the work of presenting political debates and election coverage on television. He said: “Question Time is a public display of opinion in a sometimes rumbustious forum. By contrast, podcasting is like having a quiet conversation with listeners and interviewees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9bda46709d00369a81040daff51da03efec871a/1_446_8327_4997/master/8327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0e8066efe9727eff6118d3db7141d04","title":"the photojournalism of stuart heydinger","story":"The Observer’s chief photographer from 1960-66, has died aged 92.

Tasker tapped out the post in her iPhone notes first and, 10 minutes later, found herself pressing share. “I went back in and edited it for five minutes and then sat poised, waiting for the comments.”Tasker has a public account, with more than 200,000 followers. The post wasn’t going to sit in an internet vacuum it would be seen by strangers, friends, the other parents at her daughter’s school. “This year I made over £200k,” she wrote, “mainly whilst sat at my kitchen table, drinking gin \u0026amp doing what I love… It’s all possible, friends.” Tasker knew there would be a reaction: “It was terrifying – I felt very vulnerable.” But she wanted people to know it was possible to make a very good living in her multi-hyphenate role of influencer, photographer and coach. “My parents didn’t know what I did,” she says. “There was no evidence that it was possible to do this well.”Despite the cynicism in some quarters about influencer culture, the response to her post was overwhelmingly positive. Tasker’s success story is the palatable kind: she’s a self-made northerner, who before going all-out on Instagram worked as a speech therapist in the NHS, earning £21,000 a year. She believes this coloured the response to her new, six-figure salary.“You can’t just say, ‘This is what I earn,’ and it be a neutral fact,” Tasker admits. “It has to be contextualised.” But despite all the raised-hands emojis in the comments, Tasker couldn’t sleep, knowing the post was sitting there. “I took it down two days later,” she says. “I felt like I’d had the conversations I needed to have. I didn’t want to feel like a target. It’s exposing in ways that I haven’t quite processed yet. The post felt bigger than me.”However, there are signs of a new openness, much of it led by personal revelations – from iniduals sharing their salaries, to money diaries going viral, to the rise of “debtstagrammers”, people who are happy to post their credit card bills to Instagram in the hope that their followers will make them accountable when it comes to paying back their debt. Even Lloyds bank’s latest TV ad campaign has featured family members having halting conversations about their finances, ending with the tagline: “It’s good to talk about money.”Tasker is not the only influencer to have revealed what she earns publicly. In May, the food writer and activist Jack Monroe disclosed her salary of £21,000 to a  journalist reporting on the squeamishness British people still feel about discussing what they earn. Earlier this year, fashion blogger Alex Stedman, AKA The Frugality, posted to her blog: “Money, it’s something we never have enough of, right?! But it’s also something, I believe, we’re not talking enough about.” Stedman started her blog, which champions affordable fashion and sustainability, because she “wanted to take away the stigma of not having tons of money”. She revealed that she currently pays herself a salary of £30,000 – the highest she’s ever earned.Legislation that in 2018 made it mandatory for all UK companies with more than 250 staff to publish their gender pay gap – the disparity between what male and female employees earn – has helped propel what was once private information into the public domain. Suddenly there was no denying that our reticence to talk about money was protecting unfair pay gaps and, in some cases, illegal discrimination. On 2018’s Equal Pay-Day (the day in the year that women effectively begin working for free), the Fawcett Society launched a campaign calling on people to “end the culture of pay secrecy” by “talking to your colleagues and asking what they earn”.Last month it was reported that Samira Ahmed, presenter of Newswatch, is taking the BBC to an employment tribunal over alleged unequal pay. It follows the high profile case of broadcaster Carrie Gracie, who in early 2018 resigned as the BBC’s China editor, citing gendered pay discrimination. She is passionate about why we need to get more comfortable with talking about money. “However difficult that first conversation might seem, you’ve got to have it,” she tells me. “It’s like gym work, isn’t it? You build muscle and you get stronger.” Gracie recently published a book on the subject, Equal: A Story Of Women, Men And Money. “One of the reasons I’ve written it is to say to women: ‘You really have to be vigilant.’ It is imperative for women to talk about this because, if they’re not careful, over their working life they could lose out on hundreds of thousands of pounds.”So how do you start a conversation about equal pay at work? “It’s obviously very important to start off in a friendly manner,” says Gracie, who ultimately won an apology and a payout from the BBC. “You need to be professional, businesslike, and show that you’re serious and take yourself seriously, but that doesn’t mean you have to be angry or emotional.” And if your emotions or nerves get the better of you? “If you emerge thinking, ‘Ugh, I wish I’d handled that better’, then don’t worry about it: you should be proud of yourself and know that you’ll get it better next time. It’s a learning journey.”In August 2019, Ben O’Brien, an illustrator with more than 15 years’ experience of making art for clients including the BBC, tweeted to his 25,000 followers: “Lame start to the week when I find out the job I was in line for (16 illustrations for one of the biggest smartphone brands with a major ad agency) was to be paid for with… a new phone worth £1k. No thanks mate.” The first time O’Brien had asked about the budget, his question was ignored. “I had no reason to be suspicious,” he says. “It’s a huge agency, so I presumed they were finalising details.” But a week away from starting the job, which O’Brien estimated would take a month working full-time to complete, he asked again. They replied: “No, the phone we sent you, that is the payment.” Frustrated, O’Brien aired his grievances on Twitter. “Although I have great clients, illustrators are often underpaid and undervalued,” he says. “By calling it out, I hope people will realise that it’s not OK to presume someone will work for no actual pay.”Another illustrator, Niki Groom, aka Miss Magpie, has founded a collective of illustrators who are open with each other about pay, allowing them to enter negotiations with clients knowing the market rate. She also took the step of posting her illustration earnings over the past 10 years online. Through beautifully rendered pie charts, she reveals that she went from earning just £160 from illustrating in 2012 to £59,548 in 2018. “If people think I’m showing off, then they have misunderstood,” says Groom. “I wanted people to know that it takes time to build earnings, but that it’s possible to make a living. It’s amazing how helpful a data point of one or two people can be to knowing your own worth. The most surprising thing is that even those who I’d have considered my competitors have been positive and thankful.”Once again, though, a shift does seem to be under way. On MoneySavingExpert’s Debt Free Wannabe forums, members display an almost cultish devotion to openly discussing money. Each contributor signs off their posts with the amount of debt they owe and their predicted debt-free date. While no substitute for formal, one-on-one advice, the platform is an opportunity to speak to someone who knows how it feels to be £15k in debt while earning the minimum wage. “The threads are non-judgmental places for people to swap their experiences, celebrate even the smallest of wins and, in some cases, save lives,” says Good.I speak to a woman called Anna (not her real name), who in March this year posted a list of her debts on Instagram. From a Next credit account to an American Express card, they totalled £25,438.11. She named the account @myfrugalyear and publicly announced her intention to be debt-free by March 2021. “It was a pretty rough moment, actually,” she says. “I felt like the protagonist of a 1990s debt consolidation advert, sitting head in hands at my kitchen table. I’d just had a really difficult conversation with the bank, as we were in an unarranged overdraft. They were asking when I would be out of it, and I had to say, ‘I don’t know. We were just paid last week and there is no money left.’ I realised in that moment: enough is enough. I knew I needed to sit down and add up all my debt.”The bank offered Anna an adviser, but she turned the offer down: “I didn’t want to be patronised or belittled in a meeting about my finances.” But if she couldn’t talk about it in a private room, why post it to Instagram? “I had always been influenced to spend by Instagram, and it felt like poetic justice to use it as a vehicle out of the situation,” she says. Anna is not the only one looking to social media for a way out: the hashtag #debtfreejourney has now been used half a million times on Instagram. For Anna, it’s working: in six months she’s paid off nearly £5,000 and has 20,000 new social media followers to hold her accountable. She’s also found that her relationship with Instagram has changed. “The illusion has been shattered,” she says. “I look at the interiors accounts I used to follow and think: what was so seductive about them? I look at my old feed and see it’s just pictures of stuff. Going public has forced me to be honest with myself.”The popularity of money diaries, where people document their outgoings, is another sign of the new openness about spending. ’s regular How I Spend It column, in which readers discuss their finances, has been running since January 2018 and has proved hugely popular with people who are curious about how others save or spend. For many would-be contributors, though, the sticking point is the need to declare their earnings. “Those willing to share their income details usually come from the public sector or are self-employed or on benefits,” says Patrick Collinson, editor of  Money. “If you are a nurse or teacher, then your salary details are already in a sense publicly available, as there are agreed scales.”On the website Refinery29, anonymous female social workers, accountants and paediatricians have broken down their spending in minute detail one writer included everything from their rent, to their New Year’s Eve cocaine bill, to paying their flatmate back £1 for a packet of crisps. Last month the BBC launched its own version, in which a 27-year-old wrote of her guilt over spending £1.50 on a can of tuna. The story went viral, with readers debating whether her frugality was commendable or depressing, and the woman, who wasn’t anonymous, found her spending trending on Twitter. “Money is a window into our society, so people enjoying the voyeurism of the series isn’t a surprise,” explains Gillian Orr, head of content at Refinery29. “Millennials came of age during the financial crash, so they have a different perspective on money to other generations. Whereas their parents kept conversations about finance behind closed doors, young people today are much more relaxed discussing this previously ‘sensitive’ issue with friends, partners and even strangers online.”A year after that Instagram post, I ask Sara Tasker if there have been any negative consequences of revealing her salary. “It’s been really positive – my friendships are definitely more honest,” she says. “I guess it’s slightly strange when I go out for dinner with my family, and my mum and dad will pay for my siblings and not me, but that’s also totally OK.”I ask Anna of @myfrugalyear how her friends reacted to her honesty. “They were surprised,” she says. “We’d put on a good act over the years, and no one realised quite how much debt we were in. Afterwards some friends revealed that they are in the same situation, and having that chat was such a relief – a bonding experience.” She adds that not every conversation has been that easy. “One friend who is sorted financially said, ‘Well, now I don’t feel I can talk to you about the house I’m buying.’ And in truth it does make me feel jealous. But at least we can work through those conversations together now, with a bit more empathy.”Honesty box: how to be straight about cash1 You might not be ready to chat openly, but don’t deceive yourself. Look at your bank account and be mindful when spending. No one should get to the end of the month saying, “I don’t know where all my money went.”2 Don’t just accept that you’re “rubbish with money”. As MoneySavingExpert’s Kirsty Good says, “It’s crucial a consumer can do the maths on a discount, or know how to split the bill with a friend – it stops them being ripped off.”3 Try to have casual chats about money with friends, colleagues and your partner – that way, when you have to talk about it in a high-stakes situation, you’ll have the vocabulary to advocate for yourself.4 Money is a topic for everyone, not just for rich people. There is no one who wouldn’t benefit from a conversation about it.5 Talk about how you’re paying for things, not just how much things cost. It’s a chance to educate each other about good and bad sources of credit.• Alex Holder is the author of Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life (Serpent’s Tail)If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b93aaf503195e820b2ae60639040d516385fde80/0_163_4332_2600/master/4332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34557e93407323c358026eef7b0f1640","title":"what temperature should i set my central heating","story":"My partner and I argue over whether we should turn it up or just put on another jumperEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.Our annual heating battle has begun.

Backlit, she strikes an attitude in front of an illuminated cube, bookended by more lighting. There is no band: just her, dressed a bit like a flamenco aerobics instructor. A gauzy train streams behind her, which she regularly whips for emphasis when she’s not pummelling the air with her fists.She cuts even more of a solitary figure because her last album, third outing Charli, contained multitudes. There were so many guest features, you suspected the artist born Charlotte Aitchison in Cambridgeshire 27 years ago was trying to make an ironic point about the current rash of pop hook-ups – a predilection acquired from hip-hop. That, or she was just revelling in excess, a familiar habit for an artist for whom the party never seems to end.There are 15 guests on Charli. None of them are in Birmingham, but all are thanked in a recorded message at the start of the gig. It’s worth listing them in full for the breadth of styles they encompass: French visionary Christine and the Queens, Los Angeles pop outrider Sky Ferreira, positivity powerhouse Lizzo, soft rock auteurs Haim, out pop pin-up Troye Sivan, trans electropop singer Kim Petras, Estonian mischief-maker Tommy Cash, bedroom-pop arriviste Clairo, Korean-American electronic producer Yaeji, New Orleans bounce star Big Freedia, rapper Cupcakke, sex-obsessed singer-rapper Brooke Candy and Brazilian rapper Pabllo Vittar. Aitchison also thanks AG Cook, who produced Charli with her.So: how do you tour one of the most populous albums of 2019, a work not explicitly, but still quite clearly about female solidarity and LGBTQ+ acceptance, without the album’s unique selling point – a posse? By having the brass neck to do it entirely solo. Aitchison plays the new album virtually in its entirety, with only volume and charisma to accompany her.She does have some company towards the end, though. Each stop on this jaunt has featured a handful of local drag queens, who cavort around the stage for Shake It, one of the album’s strangest, most deconstructed noise experiments.It has taken Aitchison some time to distil her essence. Her canon contains bona fide hits (some, like 2014’s Boom Clap, now retired), many standalone singles (like 2018’s near-perfect Boys, played tonight), umpteen co-writes, a few EPs (2017’s Vroom Vroom marked a turning point), a handful of mixtapes and two previous studio albums.But Charli marks peak Aitchison – an album of resonant, sad bangers that gives both Robyn and Mark Ronson a run for their money, and which ranks up there with Lana Del Rey in chronicling a version of LA, one where car engines and loud parties and “blue and yellow pills” can’t quite drown out the whirl of the abyss inside.Aitchison makes a little speech about this being the music she has always wanted to make, and although the onstage effusions of pop stars can become wearing with repetition, this one rings true. She began her career as a home counties teen prodigy who decamped to LA and spent years wrangling with the pop sausage machine, eventually emerging with artistic control and rekindled success on her own terms. She sings with a British accent. Sigrid wrote Don’t Kill My Vibe about being pushed around by older male operatives Aitchison has been fighting that corner for years, bristling since 2013’s True Romance.She has written for others, hiding behind the scenes. Most lately, she has turned to A\u0026ampR. A Netflix series begins in mid-November, charting the progress of Nasty Cherry, a girl band Aitchison has convened. It remains to be seen whether her Monkees succeed, but for now, she’s swapped opening for Taylor Swift in stadiums for making small venues rattle to the sound of a bonsai version of an arena show.The song Next Level Charli finds Aitchison ramping up the celebrations. “Turn up the volume in your Prius,” she yells, with a wink, interpolating the “vroom vrooms” from Vroom Vroom, a tune that later makes its own gloriously cacophonous appearance: “Let’s ride!” it goes.In its infancy, pop was all about cars and girls (as a Prefab Sprout hit once satirised the work of Bruce Springsteen). Aitchison’s pop is largely about cars and boys, a tendency that reaches an apotheosis of sorts on White Mercedes. It starts minimally, with her vocals front and centre they gradually warp and bend with effects. The chorus is pure pop schmaltz (“Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast”) but it finds her apologising to a lover she has wronged.Aitchison is not one for highfalutin theory. Her work is very direct: (“I don’t care!” yelled her first hit, given to Icona Pop, “I love it!” It comes in the encore). But she is an avant gardist’s dream, taking all the ingredients of pappy mainstream chart-filler – nagging melody, partying beats, R\u0026ampB excess, youthful lust, EDM drama and soggy heartbreak – to the very edge of what a pop audience can aurally bear. The saccharine insistence of J-pop looms large, as do cheerleader chants. When Aitchison connected with a cadre of London leftfield producers like Sophie and AG Cook, working as the label PC Music (PVC music would have been a better name, given their productions all sounded like lurex rubbing against polyvinyl chloride), two disruptive imperatives chimed.Sometimes, this set suggests Dua Lipa remixed by Aphex Twin – or, on the gustier ballads, Bonnie Raitt produced by the Crazy Frog. Vroom Vroom (which was co-produced by Sophie) remains all futurism and onomatopoeia and sonic aggro. Click is functionally a hip-hop cut, made up entirely of posturing and digital shock and awe.Aitchison seems to be made entirely of swagger – every whipcrack beat gets a kick or a slap – but simultaneously, she owns up to self-doubt, mistakes, and regrets, capturing the grand drama of love going wrong. The tunes ring out of the cacophony. Gone – sans Christine and the Queens – casts her as an unexpected introvert hating “all these people”, but this anti-party anthem still manages to sound huge. Strafed with screes of sound, Silver Cross builds and builds but – crucially – never peaks, withholding the satisfaction of a conventional EDM-pop bass drop, or much in the way of resolution. It just ratchets upwards and plateaus, leaving you wanting more of its lurid neon oversaturation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b690ec565713464060098ab7392e7ab0f5dcca3a/0_171_4328_2596/master/4328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbbe8ad78223ccbf5d367b0b6a3f9fde","title":"dominic grieve calls for release of report on russian meddling in uk","story":"Intelligence and security committee chair says dossier has facts ‘germane’ to votersDominic Grieve has called for the publication of a report on Russian meddling in the democratic process to be published before the general election, saying it contains knowledge “germane” to voters.Boris Johnson had been expected to approve publication of the 50-page dossier, compiled by the cross-party intelligence and security committee, by Thursday. His failure to do so sparked calls for its release amid speculation that it could potentially be damaging to the government.“I cannot think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published,” Grieve, the committee’s chairman, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It’s very demoralising for us when we find we put in months of work and at the end of it, we’re not getting an adequate response.”Grieve said the report was informative and people should be entitled to access it. “It seems to us that this report is germane because we do know – and I think it is widely accepted – that the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries’ democratic processes in the past.”In a later interview with Sky, Grieve, who was attorney-general from 2010-14, defended the neutrality of the committee, which he said served to inform the public about the security services’ effectiveness and the nature of external threats the UK may face – “in this case concentrating on Russia because of recent events showing Russia is undoubtedly a threat”.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was among those who called for the report to be published, asking what the government “have got to hide”. “Yes, it should be released,” he said. “And I suspect that the reason it hasn’t been published is because they’re going to delay it past the dissolution of parliament on Tuesday, and then they can hide it away until some point in the future.“If a report has been called for and written, and it should be in the public domain, then what have they got to hide?”“Because, if there is information that we should know about what has happened in previous democratic events and who has tried to interfere, the public has a right to know and the government shouldn’t be keeping it a secret.” The House of Commons was previously told that the report had been sent to the prime minister on 17 October, and Grieve – who will sit as an independent at the next election after he was expelled from the Conservative party over Brexit – said it must be released before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday, otherwise it may never be published.It is understood that the dossier examines allegations that Russian money has flowed into British politics in general and to the Conservative party in particular. It also includes claims that Russia launched a major influence operation in 2016 in support of Brexit.The process for clearing the report on security grounds was completed in the middle of October, after it was finalised in March 2019, but it has since sat with Downing Street awaiting its final release, according to the BBC.The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said there was nothing unusual about the failure to publish the report. She told the Today programme she did not know why the publication had been delayed and said: “I wouldn’t accept that it’s been held up. I don’t think there’s anything unusual about this. Many select committee reports are produced and the government has to respond properly. It cannot respond in haste.” John Bercow, the outgoing Speaker of the House of Commons, said on Thursday that he hoped the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, would help expedite the publication of the report and that it would not be necessary for Grieve to raise the matter again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1131d4bb35a82511dbb90a925aa3f903c6034a5b/0_250_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b092562088675aff773878984da0510","title":"nicola sturgeon scots must send resounding message over independence vote","story":"First minister tells rally general election is ‘most important one Scotland has faced in our lifetimes’ Nicola Sturgeon has urged supporters to “get on with the job” of securing a new independence referendum, as the Conservative and Labour parties harden their stance on granting Holyrood the powers to hold second vote, before a Scottish election campaign that promises to be dominated once again by the constitution.At a rally in Glasgow on Saturday afternoon, the first minister and Scottish National party leader described the forthcoming general election as “the most important one Scotland has faced in our life times”.She told thousands of cheering independence supporters to “make sure we persuade everyone we know to get out on 12 December and send the biggest, loudest, most resounding message to Westminster that it’s time for Scotland to choose its own future”.Sturgeon intends to make holding a second independence referendum in 2020 central to her party’s campaign, and confirmed on Friday that she would demand the Westminster government transfer the powers to do so, regardless of the election result, by the end of the year.But while she insisted that electoral success would create an “irresistible demand” for another vote, the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said in an interview with the Herald on Saturday that even if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats they would “absolutely not have a mandate”, while Jeremy Corbyn on Friday dismissed a second referendum as “neither desirable or necessary”.The SNP leader told the rally in Glasgow’s George Square, organised by Scotland’s only independence-supporting daily newspaper, the National: “We are gathered here for one simple purpose, to demand the right to choose a better future for our country.”She promised that, if Scots voted in December “to escape the chaos, ision and misery of Brexit”, then she would lead the country to an independence referendum next year.The pedestrian square, described by Glasgow city council leader Susan Aitken earlier in the rally as “the spiritual home of our great yes movement”, was a sea of saltires on Saturday. The SNP logo was present but by no means pervasive, as most rally-goers waved the colourful Yes flags of the wider pro-independence movement.Sturgeon had not addressed a gathering of the broader yes movement since 2014 and has been criticised by some activists for not supporting a series of well-attended marches held across Scotland over the summer.The crowd, which organisers estimated reached 20,000 at its busiest, heard from speakers across the pro-independence movement, including members of Women for Independence and the Scottish Independence Convention, and Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who made an appeal for a “broad and inclusive” campaign.A noisy counter-demonstration, cordoned by police on the opposite side of the square from the main rally stage, attempted to drown out speakers by blowing whistles and singing Rule Britannia.Sitting on a bench in the middle of the square, wrapped in a saltire flag, 75-year-old Edna Matteson said that she believed support for independence and the fairness it could bring was growing across the country. “People have had enough. Children should not be living in poverty in this day and age. I was born at the end of world war two when we didn’t have one food bank, let alone thousands.”Matteson, a former Labour voter who travelled from Greenock to attend Saturday’s rally, said she was aware that some “blamed” the older generation for voting no in 2014. “People assume we’re afraid of losing our pensions, but those were the fear tactics used in 2014. I want independence for the children who are growing up now.”Amy Watt, a business management student from north Glasgow, said it was important to show the strength of support for independence. “The yes movement never went away, but we accepted the result in 2014. Now too much has changed. Look how erse it is: young, old, all different colours and backgrounds.”Watt added: “I’m happy that Nicola Sturgeon has kept away until now because this was never about the SNP or one political party, but now the SNP can be the vehicle to independence.”Pointing to her teenage brother and his friends who had accompanied her to the event, she explained: “Everyone is politically engaged now because of Brexit.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab96bda7a519974a489b02260b61958fcf4234d/0_116_3410_2046/master/3410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94b8339363e2c69b1d46f2450d48120","title":"tories hold 16 point lead over labour according to poll","story":"Lead would be enough to give Boris Johnson’s Conservatives comfortable majorityThe Conservatives hold a 16-point lead over Labour ahead of the 12 December general election, according to the latest OpiniumObserver poll.If the lead endured until polling day, it would be enough to give the Tories a comfortable overall majority and allow the prime minister to push his Brexit deal through parliament and take the UK out of the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68fd0475315bd146ca549562ff169ee1df48adae/0_276_5854_3513/master/5854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=913eb01bf11283d5d6c5f2cc2f473feb","title":"workington man cumbria brexit labour bellwether town general election","story":"A thinktank identified ‘Workington Man’ as a crucial group of voters. But does the Cumbrian town see itself as a bellwether?Workington Man was having a peaceful smoke outside the Henry Bessemer pub when the word “politics” triggered a furious torrent.“Politics? You mean Brexit and all that? I’m sick of it, absolutely sick to death. Let them do what they want, I don’t give a shit any more, excuse my language. I’m sick of listening to them, no one gives you a straight yes or no. I know I should vote, but sod that. I can’t be bothered any more,” said Anthony McMillin, 60.McMillin comes from a “whole family” of Labour voters, and he voted Labour in every election until two years ago, when he switched to Ukip. He left school at 16 for a job in the local steelworks, which lasted three years until the plant closed in 1975. Then he was a swimming pool attendant, and later played in a band until the gigs dried up. Now he just about gets by, treating himself to the occasional pint at the Henry Bessemer, a Wetherspoons establishment named after a 19th-century engineer and inventor.McMillin’s biography largely fits the profile of “Workington Man”, the invention of a right-leaning thinktank Onward to describe the cohort of voters it says the Conservative party must win over if Boris Johnson is to secure a majority at next month’s election. Onward’s report said Workington Man was over 45, white, without a degree, voted Leave in the 2016 referendum, worried about crime, and “favours security over freedom”. Workington, on the Cumbrian coast, is “one of the places where the eponymous archetype is most common among the local electorate” and is “the ultimate bellwether seat, despite being a longstanding Labour stronghold”.According to Will Tanner, the thinktank’s director: “It is clear that the Conservatives’ path to victory runs through working-class rugby league towns like Workington, Warrington and Wigan … as well as the party’s leafy heartlands in the south of England.”Workington Town, the local rugby league club, swiftly issued a statement setting out its “apolitical” credentials. Implicitly disassociating itself from Workington Man, the club said: “We cater for a broad church of fans, players and volunteers of all backgrounds, ages and gender, and always have done.”Like Worcester Woman, Mondeo Man and other erstwhile target voters, Workington Man may disappear as quickly as he rose to prominence. Nevertheless, the Conservatives wasted no time in announcing a multibillion-pound funding package for towns in marginals in England’s north and the Midlands, aimed at revitalising high streets and supporting small businesses. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage said he would visit Workington this week as part of the Brexit party’s bid to win over disaffected pro-Leave voters from both the Conservatives and Labour.The sitting Labour MP, Sue Hayman, who is defending a majority of 3,925, dismissed the Workington Man epithet. “It’s extremely old fashioned to try to put people into narrow, cliched categories,” she told the Observer. “To assume all people who have a certain type of job and enjoy a certain type of sport and have a certain type of education are all going to vote in the same way is deeply patronising. I also couldn’t believe, in this day and age, that women have been completely ignored.”Apart from a three-year aberration, Workington has elected a Labour MP for the past 100 years. But its once muscular industrial base of shipbuilding, coal and steel has long gone, and in recent years traditional identities have fractured. Now, the main employers are the nearby Sellafield nuclear plant and a Swedish-owned paper factory, which has hinted at job cuts in the coming months. Tourism, farming and small food production form the basis of the local economy.It is Britain’s least erse constituency, said Hayman, and has a population ageing at twice the average national rate. “Due to lack of industry and job prospects, young people leave, and older people come to retire because it’s beautiful.”She listened to everyone, she said. “Some constituents tell me they want to leave with no deal, some ask me to negotiate a good deal, some are desperate for me to promote Remain and a public vote, some don’t care. Not everybody cares about Brexit.”She was sceptical about whether the Tories would invest significantly in targeting her constituency, pointing out that the Conservative party was defending even smaller majorities than hers in two other Cumbria seats, Carlisle and Copeland. She will base her campaign on defending the NHS and expanding local transport infrastructure – “the things that people really care about day to day, what affects their lives” – but acknowledged that Brexit would be a significant factor.“I don’t think there’s any point in worrying. I’ve been the MP for four and a half years, a lot of people know me, and I think people will vote on different issues. I will just have to wait and see what people want to vote on. And if ultimately that means I lose my seat, then that’s what happens.”The Conservatives’ hopes of taking Workington will have been boosted this weekend by a Survation poll for the Daily Mail which found that they were on course to win by more than 4,000 votes, with a 10-point swing from Labour. It may be ill-advised to give credence to any poll. But of the dozen or so Workington Men approached by the Observer last week, none said they intended to vote Labour. More than half insisted they would not vote a few said they were undecided one planned to vote for an independent candidate, and one said he would vote for either the Conservatives or the Brexit party, “whichever gives the clearest promise to come out”.Tony Wareing, 71, a local businessman and chair of the Workington Heritage Group, said he recognised Workington Man among friends, associates and neighbours. “He is typical of most of the industrial towns throughout northern England that have traditionally voted Labour. That’s changing because of Brexit. This is a Labour town but it’s on the brink of change. Most people voted to leave, and it hasn’t happened, and they are very fed up. It will be the issue that decides the election here. Labour voters might not switch to the Conservatives – they will probably just not vote.”The local Brexit party candidate, Philip Walling, a former barrister who writes books on rural issues and has never belonged to a political party before, hoped to persuade disaffected Labour voters to back him. “I’ve heard a lot of people saying they are sick of the political classes and they won’t vote,” he said. “But there are also an enormous number of people saying, ‘I’ve always voted Labour, and I can’t stomach the Tories, but I’m prepared to vote for you.’ They are Labour Leavers, and there’s no other place for them to go.”Hayman feared it could become “a quite unpleasant and aggressive election”. Despite an “enormous amount of abuse: ‘traitor’, ‘witch’, the death-threat thing”, she had never considered standing down. Instead, she was braced for a challenging campaign, the outcome of which was far from certain. “I think it’s going to be very volatile and it’s difficult to judge what’s going to happen at this stage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abe7c893b6fd2bfeed52027e64b16380b8d56d34/0_777_3888_2332/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a90acc001ad331320964215daea91b86","title":"hubble constant mystery that keeps getting bigger estimate rate expansion universe cosmology cepheid","story":"Scientists have found a discrepancy in estimates for the rate of expansion of the universe. Why is this and what does it mean?Astronomers have reached a fundamental impasse in their understanding of the universe: they cannot agree how fast it is flying apart. And unless a reasonable explanation can be found for their differing estimates, they may be forced to completely rethink their ideas about time and space. Only new physics can now account for the cosmic conundrum they have uncovered, many believe.“Five years ago, no one in cosmology was really worried about the question of how fast the universe was expanding. We took it for granted,” says astrophysicist Daniel Mortlock of Imperial College London. “Now we are having to do a great deal of head scratching – and a lot of research.”This view is backed by the US astrophysicist and Nobel prize winner Adam Riess, of Johns Hopkins University. “I think this issue has become a big deal. We were getting better and better at understanding the universe and yet the closer we have been looking, the more we have found there are all these mysterious components.”Over the decades, these surprises have included the discovery of dark matter – believed to be made up of as yet undetected particles – whose extra gravitational pull explains why galaxies do not fly apart. In addition, astronomers have also discovered the existence of dark energy, which is accelerating the rate at which the cosmos is expanding.“Those two discoveries were remarkable enough,” adds Riess who won his Nobel for his involvement in the discovery of dark energy. “But now we are facing the fact there may be a third phenomenon that we had overlooked – though we haven’t really got a clue yet what it might be.”Scientists first realised the universe was expanding in the 1920s, when the US astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the greater the distance between two galaxies, the faster they are moving apart. It remains one of the most important scientific discoveries ever made.One way to think about this phenomenon is to imagine a fruit loaf that is being cooked in an oven. As its dough rises and expands, the raisins and sultanas embedded inside the loaf move farther away from each other. The universe is like that fruit loaf. It is expanding and causing the galaxies – the raisins and sultanas embedded in it – to speed away from each other.But if the universe was getting bigger and bigger, one key question remained: what is the exact rate of this expansion? Just how quickly is the cosmos flying apart? Or to be more precise: what is the exact value of the Hubble constant, as the speed of the universe’s expansion was subsequently termed? It is a highly important, much sought-after value because it will tell us a great deal about the origin, age, evolution, and ultimately the fate, of the cosmos. Hence the effort astronomers have made over the past century to find a precise answer.These observations have been based on two very different approaches, however. One has focused on the behaviour of galaxies near our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and has involved scientists working out – with increasing precision – just how fast they are speeding away from each other. “That’s the local approach,” says Riess whose own work has concentrated on trying to perfect the measurement of distances between galaxies in our region of the universe. (See “Hubble’s constant and Henrietta Leavitt”, below.)The other method for establishing the Hubble constant has involved astronomers looking at the rippling pattern of light, called the cosmic microwave background, that formed just after the big bang birth of the cosmos 13.8bn years ago. This background has been surveyed with increasing precision by US and European satellites – most recently by the European Space Agency’s Planck observatory – and these observations have allowed scientists to build a model that takes account of dark energy and dark matter and that shows how the early universe’s growth would probably have produced an expansion that astronomers can measure today.And until very recently, these two different approaches produced estimates that appeared to be consistent with each other, although there were considerable uncertainties associated with both measurements. “Everyone’s best bet was that the difference between the two estimates was just down to chance, and that the two values would converge as more and more measurements were taken,” says Mortlock. In other words, as the two values were tested with greater and greater precision, their differences would disappear.Unfortunately for astronomers seeking a simple fix to the problem, this has not happened. “In fact, the opposite has occurred,” says Mortlock. “The discrepancy has become stronger. The estimate of the Hubble constant that had the lower value has got a bit lower over the years and the one that was a bit higher has got even greater.”Today, those using Planck and cosmic background data to obtain a value for the Hubble constant get a figure of 67.4 plus or minus 0.5. By contrast the local approach gives a figure of 73.5 plus or minus 1.4. These values represent the two different values we have for the expansion of the universe. (See “A matter of metrics”, below.)The dissimilarity may not sound great but it is significant. They say there is now less than a one in 100,000 chance that this difference can be accounted for by chance. “This is not just two experiments disagreeing,” says Riess. “We are measuring something fundamentally different. One is a measurement of how fast the universe is expanding today as we see it. The other is a prediction based on the physics of the early universe and on measurements of how fast it ought to be expanding. And these measurements have now been independently corroborated by other groups so that the discrepancy does not depend on any one tool or any one team.“And if these values don’t agree, that means there is a very strong likelihood that we’re missing a factor in the cosmological model that connects the two eras.” In short, something appears to be absent from our understanding of the universe and the Hubble constant has become the focus of a hotly contested battle to discover the nature of this invisible influence.For a start, the difference between two values has implications for the age of the universe, lopping off more than a billion years of its existence in one case. “Changing the Hubble constant from 67.4 to 73.5 would mean it must have been flying apart faster than previously supposed and so must be younger than its currently accepted age of 13.8bn years,” says Mortlock. “In fact it would cut to 12.7bn years.”And this does cause problems. There are some very old stars in the universe that have estimated ages of around 12bn years, and this makes a revalued cosmic chronology a bit difficult to stomach. Stars take a long time to form, after all.However, that is not the real issue, says Mortlock. “The basic problem is that having two different figures for the Hubble constant measured from different perspectives would simply invalidate the cosmological model we made of the universe. So we wouldn’t be able to say what the age of the universe was until we had put our physics right.”Because of the independent corroborations, Riess has become more confident there must be a fundamental discrepancy involved, one that is not due to methodological flaws or mistakes in observations but caused by a feature of our universe of which scientists have had no previous inkling. “I think that there is something interesting going on,” he says. “And I do not consider measurement errors interesting.”But if measurement error can no longer be considered a cause of the differences in Hubble constant values, what new concepts could explain this discrepancy? Astronomers have already put forward a number of suggestions.One idea proposes that the universe contains a new class of subatomic particle that travels close to the speed of light. These entities are called dark radiation and could also include already known particles such as neutrinos. These would affect the speed of the universe’s expansion.Another idea is there was a special, intense dark-energy episode not long after the big bang, which expanded the universe faster than astronomers had previously appreciated.And finally there is the possibility that the particles that make up dark matter interact more strongly with normal matter than previously assumed. Again this would have an impact on the Hubble constant.Not every scientist is over the moon about the prospect that one of these proposals is the answer to their measurement quandary and still hope that in the end it may be possible to reconcile the two values they get for the Hubble constant. This point is stressed by Mortlock. “We already have found that our universe is dominated by dark matter and by dark energy whose effects we can observe but whose basic nature is a mystery. They are two huge question marks that are already hanging over our understanding of the cosmos. Personally, I do not feel the need for a third.”For his part, Riess takes a slightly more optimistic view. “We are not made of dark matter or dark energy but we have uncovered their existence even though, intuitively, they are not part of our experience of life on Earth. That suggests we are heading in the right direction in understanding the universe – though it just may be that we have at least one other step to take.”Stars known as Cepheid variables have played a critical role in our understanding of the expansion of the universe. These stars, which are relatively common, vary in brightness over periods of days or weeks. In 1908 Henrietta Leavitt discovered there was a relationship between the brightness of a Cepheid variable star and the time it took to go through a full cycle of change in its luminosity.As a result, by measuring the period of a Cepheid variable, it became possible to calculate its true brightness. Then, by comparing this to its apparent brightness, astronomers could calculate the distance of the star – and the galaxy in which it is found. Hubble used this understanding in his work to calibrate cosmological distances, and Cepheids today continue to provide key calibration for astronomical distances for the local method for calculating the Hubble constant.A Hubble constant of 70 would mean that the universe is expanding at a rate of 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. To understand what this means, you must first appreciate that a parsec is a measure of astronomical distance and that a megaparsec is the equivalent of a million parsecs. In turn there are 3.3 light years to a parsec, so a megaparsec is the equivalent of 3.3m light years. Thus for each 3.3m light years that a galaxy is distant from us, it will move an extra 70 kilometres (43.5 miles) per second faster from us, as a result of the expansion of the universe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7f5254bddf39ed836c205d9a437aa7e9606c52/239_203_3181_1910/master/3181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb8f2a669b435a2c6c87c7b26f91d928","title":"england south africa fans preview world cup final","story":"The two sets of supporters are ready for the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday – when they will both be on the bacon butties“I’ve been supporting England since I was 11 and remember cheering the World Cup win in 2003. I’m optimistic it will happen again on Saturday, when I’ll be up at the crack of dawn to drive to Surrey to watch the game with my dad as per our tradition. I couldn’t think of anyone better to watch it with – he’s so invested in England rugby matches that he’ll yell, curse and roar. His enthusiasm is infectious sometimes I’m louder than he is! My mum isn’t a rugby fan, but she’s always brilliant – supplying us with sausage sandwiches and putting up with our swearing.England need to maintain the brilliant form they showed against Australia and New Zealand. Both teams are going to go for broke and we need to be careful not to lapse into some of the sloppiness we’ve been prone to in the past.

On Saturday, I’ll be watching at home with my rugby teammates and some close friends, wearing an England jersey with a Japanese beer in hand. Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola are due a stormer.

I’ve enjoyed watching all of it and on Saturday, my teammates and I will be watching the game at our club on the big screen. My advice to the England team is to tackle hard, run fast and score lots of tries. Rosa McDonald, nine, Haywards HeathIt was been a thrilling experience. My family and I found a South African-run pub, the Percy Arms in Chilworth, which draws a large crowd of South Africans. I find watching the game at a pub with lots of fans makes it all the more enjoyable and exciting. You feed off the energy of other supporters. South Africa’s first game was a disappointing loss and left me feeling surprisingly low (still hopeful, however) but I love how rugby elicits such strong emotions. No matter what the score, it brings everyone together – even opposing sides!We’ll be watching the final with a number of fellow South Africans at the pub, bacon butty and beer in hand. South Africa really needs this win. With our first black captain and the most culturally erse team we’ve ever had, South Africans everywhere could use this to unite as a nation. This would go far in blurring racial lines that still form a ide in our country. England have done so well this World Cup. If they win, they will truly deserve it, but we won’t go down without a serious fight.If South Africa are to win, we need to focus on keeping our strong defence lines intact. England are a strong team and are going to make this a tough game. We need to keep as much possession as possible and ensure we don’t drop the ball – in all senses of the word. Shannon O’Farrell, a South Africa fan in GuildfordIt’s been a very exciting World Cup. I’m so glad for Japan. It’s going to be one cracker of a game on Saturday. Both teams are so strong physically. I can’t wait for the final. I’m having a braai (barbecue) at my brother’s house next to the swimming pool and a big TV outside. All four of my brothers will be there and we will be going big with outfits and flags, all the necessary stuff. We will open the first can of beer at 9am, two hours before kick-off. The Springboks need to play wisely with their physicality and dominate England up front. The rest will fall in place. Enjoy the game. May the best team win. Anton Wessels, Johannesburg“I’m very excited about how South Africa have progressed. The low was losing to New Zealand after camping in their half for 20 minutes and only getting three points for their efforts. On a high happy, they made the final and were made to work hard for it by Wales which has prepared them for the final.The difference between teams is basically nothing but England may have peaked a week too early. We have not seen the best of this South Africa team. If they click on Saturday, England are in for a torrid time.I shall be watching with my brother as I can scream at his house as his wife is a Springbok supporter. South Africa will have to play it in the forwards with their power and domination of being very physical and in England’s faces. Their backs can also be devastating, especially Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe. If given the chance, Damian De Alande and Pollard can be dangerous. They must just stay calm and focused.” David Lichtenstein, South Africa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c6393ee2b011a4651e213ef79d79f46c4333aa0/0_100_3736_2241/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=139347e2dc26ad50e542f5f563584944","title":"england south africa rugby world cup final match report","story":"• Springboks crowned world champions for a third time• Pollard kicks 22 points, Mapimpi and Kolbe add triesIn the end it felt as if it was written in the stars. Every 12 years South Africa have an unerring habit of winning World Cups and they have done so again, following up their triumphs of 1995 and 2007 with another prodigious display of power and might. In some ways this was an even more special achievement, certainly for anyone who has ever dreamed of a black Springbok captain lifting the Webb Ellis Cup.The image of Siya Kolisi hoisting the golden trophy into the clear Japanese night sky is set to become as treasured a picture as that of Nelson Mandela congratulating Francois Pienaar in Johannesburg 24 years ago, transcending such minor details as the scoreline and the sense of English disappointment. There are inspirational stories of hope overcoming colossal odds and then, above all else, there is the tale of Kolisi, the sport-loving boy from the townships of Port Elizabeth who has conquered the world.On the podium during the presentations Kolisi could be seen trying to persuade his coach and longtime mentor, Rassie Erasmus, to collect the trophy with him. Erasmus has done an extraordinary job of resurrecting a struggling team but there was as much chance of him allowing Kolisi to win that battle as England had of escaping the onrushing South African juggernaut once it started to rumble.The Boks had a crestfallen England exactly where they wanted them long before two last-quarter tries from the wingers, Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe, settled a wincingly physical contest. Under massive scrum pressure and lacking the accuracy and front-foot dynamism that characterised their stunning semi-final win over New Zealand, there were only fleeting moments when England looked like emulating Martin Johnson’s champions of 2003.They could have no complaints, even if the final margin was a touch inflated. South Africa fully deserved to become the second country, after the All Blacks, to win three World Cups and propelled by a dominant pack and 22 points from their fly-half Handré Pollard they also now have the distinction of becoming the first side to win a World Cup having lost a pool game en route, after meeting defeat in their opener to New Zealand.Those predicting a comfortable England win were guilty of overlooking South Africa’s proud World Cup heritage. They had never previously fallen at the final hurdle nor conceded a try in their two previous finals. Both records remain intact. From the moment Kyle Sinckler was knocked out cold in the third minute following an accidental collision, England appeared trapped in the headlights, totally unable to gain the kind of gainline ascendancy that shocked New Zealand a week earlier.Was it big-occasion nerves that undermined them or just the incessant pummelling they took from umpteen big South Africans? Either way, they were a pale shadow of the white tornadoes who tore through the All Blacks.On a cool, windless evening the signs were ominous from the start. Pollard had already missed a long-range penalty before a shaken Sinckler was forced off. Barely had Dan Cole jogged on to replace him than England’s scrum was being shunted backwards, with Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira leading the charge.When the Boks took the lead through a simple Pollard penalty in the 10th minute, after Owen Farrell had been caught in front of his own posts, it was well overdue.Nothing was working for England. Passes fell to earth and uncertainty began to ripple through the team. Only when South Africa were slightly unluckily penalised after Pollard juggled a high ball and the subsequent catcher, Pieter-Steph du Toit, was adjudged offside, did England enjoy a momentary lull. Farrell chipped over an equalising penalty but a botched restart collection and yet more scrum pressure allowed Pollard to restore his side’s advantage.A big tackle from Sam Underhill on Du Toit offered temporarily relief but, despite a prolonged period of advantage close to the Bok line, England could only come away with another Farrell penalty.Again it provided a brief respite. Mapimpi robbed Elliot Daly in the air and with England again clinging on illegally on the floor Pollard made it 9-6.England would definitely have settled for a three-point half-time deficit but another punishing scrum prompted Jérôme Garcès to extend his arm again. The excellent Pollard was wheeling away to the tunnel even before his fourth penalty had sailed between the uprights.What could possibly turn the tide? The organisers opted to play John Denver’s Take Me Home, Country Roads that, for a moment or two, completely changed the vibe in the stadium. It felt almost like a heartfelt farewell appreciation to the tournament and 70,000 spectators, some of whom have been away for weeks, were suddenly united as one.England, though, needed to break the spell out on the pitch. If they glimpsed a ray of hope when their chief tormentor Mtawarira and his fellow prop, Frans Malherbe, were replaced three minutes into the second half, it was merely the headlights of another onrushing train. Steven Kitshoff and Vincent Koch would make most starting XVs in the world and yet another scrum penalty allowed Pollard to make it 15-6.Bringing on Joe Marler for Mako Vunipola, in the circumstances, was a no-brainer and the Harlequins loose-head made an immediate difference. Farrell drilled home a 46-metre penalty and should have had another when Pollard, attempting to jink his way out of defence, was tap-tackled by Anthony Watson and penalised for not releasing. It was a false dawn, with Lukhanyo Am unselfishly putting an exultant Mapimpi over and Kolbe leaving Farrell sprawling down the right touchline to complete the rout.The dramatic final act was typical of a tournament that seldom disappointed. From the hot springs of Beppu to the backstreets of Tokyo there was something for everyone, entirely justifying the decision to stage the event in Asia for the first time. Japan have been exceptional hosts, consistently exceeding expectations on and off the field. Even for England’s disappointed players, the memories will last a lifetime."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376c93893e1f99ac5238b0ab79e4702bc68ca0f6/0_44_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1016270a5657ab48ead128aff9b17b3a","title":"wta finals ashleigh barty karolina pliskova elina svitolina","story":"Although almost every day of the WTA finals has provided another nightmarish reminder of just how gruelling the season is – and how much everyone could do with a holiday – the Shenzhen crowd will get the showdown it deserves as the world No 1, Ashleigh Barty, and the defending champion, Elina Svitolina, face off for the biggest prize money in tennis history.It was sealed by two contrasting results on Saturday. Belinda Bencic became the tournament’s fourth casualty in five days when she retired with a leg injury sustained in the first set of her 7-5, 6-4, 4-1 loss to Svitolina, then Ashleigh Barty confidently recovered to beat Karolina Pliskova 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.It was a bitter missed opportunity for Bencic. After her prodigious youth was derailed with surgery and countless injuries, this has been the year she finally blossomed. Her struggles have forged a more mature player and she has used that maturity to return to the top 10 and reaching her first grand slam semi-final at the US Open with a win over the defending champion, Naomi Osaka.Bencic started the match with discipline and focus, taking the ball early and intelligently opening up the court. She took the first set, but she had arrived in Shenzhen after a manic race to seal the final spot and her efforts finally caught up with her.As Bencic’s foot began to cramp, Svitolina took full advantage, breaking in the opening game of the second set and never looking back. The Ukrainian was vicious, serving 16 aces and lengthening the rallies until the pain was too much and Bencic, eventually, had to tap out.The great irony of Svitolina soaring while so many of her rivals’ bodies have collapsed is that much of her own season has been marred by injury. The struggles with her knees have been so significant that she arrived at Wimbledon with an ugly seven losses in eight matches. Her best form seemed a long way away.Svitolina rescued her year on the stage she had previously struggled badly on, reaching her first grand slam semi-final at Wimbledon and an excellent US Open, but at times it has still been a struggle. Svitolina won an astonishing nine titles in 2017 and 2018, yet until had failed to reach a final this year. She has found her killer instinct again in Shenzhen.Facing her from across the net will be the best player of the year. The last time Barty faced Pliskova, she produced the serving performance of her life, slamming down 15 aces to win the Miami title in March. That marked by far the biggest title of her career at that point and it propelled her into the top 10, imbuing her with the confidence to do so much more.Although Barty has not blown the world away since her surprise Roland Garros title, her consistent results have reflected how steady her game is and how many options she has at her disposal. Many players struggle after their first title, but even without producing her best tennis she has continued to go deep into big events.Pliskova played some breathtaking tennis to overcome Simona Halep on Friday and she started well against Barty, but Barty has an entire toolkit reserved for making it so much tougher to tee off and laser winners on to the lines.Barty’s backhand handcuffed Pliskova and forced her to constantly bend her knees throughout, and her whippy topspin forehand spun high out of the Czech’s strike zone. She could only maintain her level for one set before Barty’s resourcefulness overwhelmed her.Barty turned the match around with the hard-earned confidence of a player who is now 55-11 in 2019 and the certain WTA player of the year. Her season has been a dream and her final WTA match of the year will require some of the best tennis she can play: Svitolina is now on a 10-match winning streak at the WTA finals and she is yet to lose to the Australian in five meetings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0ecf6a7e79f7025624987a63fc4649b4e4850c/0_148_4772_2863/master/4772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47a5714ed290f1472b58d9a7f5f307ab","title":"south africa springboks england rugby world cup victory motivation","story":"Led by a kid from the townships, South Africa’s triumphant side simply had more to play for than EnglandIf there has been a theme of the World Cup, a lesson for us all to take from these long seven weeks, it is this: the game sometimes runs on strange and powerful currents. It is not necessarily the sharpest, smartest, fittest, fastest or strongest team that wins, but the one who wants it most.Listening to South Africa’s captain, Siya Kolisi, and coach, Rassie Erasmus, talk about what this victory meant in the minutes after they had won it, you began to understand exactly what England were up against and the way the Springboks were thinking about it, England had lost the match before it even began.Nobody had won the World Cup after losing a game earlier in the tournament. That was one of Eddie Jones’s favourite facts, one he quoted more than once along the way, as his team reeled off their five consecutive victories. Then they met the Springboks, who were beaten by New Zealand in the opening week. This time, the end was in the beginning.“That first defeat was a great lesson for us,” Erasmus said. “The whole week was terrible, the entire buildup, and that taught us a lot about how we should handle the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.”He added: “We started talking about pressure. In South Africa pressure is not having a job. Pressure is one of your close relatives murdered.“Because South Africa has a lot of problems and we started talking about how rugby shouldn’t be something that puts pressure on you. It should be something that creates hope. But you can’t create hope just by talking about it, hope is not something you say in a beautiful tweet.“Hope is when you play well. Hope is when people watch the game on a Saturday, and they have a BBQ, and they feel good about themselves, and no matter your political differences, or your belief differences, for those 80 minutes, you all agree. It is not our responsibility as players to create that hope, it is our privilege.”What did England, this callow team, the youngest to play in a final in the professional era, have to pitch against that? South Africa showed these men of will, what will really is.Listening to Erasmus talk, sport never sounded less like war minus the shooting. Which was strange, because during the game it seldom looked so much like it. Especially on England’s side. “It felt like we didn’t fire a shot in that first half,” said Owen Farrell.They threw just about everything else at South Africa, mind, and the match felt, at times, almost too vicious and too brutal, that the players were giving more than should ever be demanded in the cause of what is, at the end of it all, just entertainment.There were casualties. South Africa lost their hooker, Mbongeni Mbonambi, and their lock Lood de Jager in the heat of the opening 20 minutes. Although you cannot really ide a match such as this one up into quarters. It seemed, like trench warfare, to pass in seasons, with a frontline that hardly seemed to shift position for long stretches.Neither of South Africa’s losses cost them quite as much as England’s did, though. Kyle Sinckler was knocked out cold. He caught an elbow on the head as he tried to tackle Makazole Mapimpi. It was five long minutes before Sinckler even shifted.It was the first turning point. Sinckler is one of the keystones England’s game is built on. They missed him in attack, because their runners flow around him, and missed him even more in the set pieces.In the next 40 minutes, the South Africa pack ate up England’s scrum as if it had been charcoal-grilled and served up in a bun with mustard and fried onions. England buckled at the first scrum after the restart, where they conceded the first of the six scrum penalties they gave up in the space of 40 minutes. It was a judo move. The Springboks had taken one of England’s biggest strengths and, by attacking it so ruthlessly, turned it into one of their biggest weaknesses.Erasmus did not want to take credit for it. “The one thing I don’t want to do is sound very clever now, because I know that pisses a lot of people off when you sound clever about things you’ve done beforehand,” he said. The scrummaging, he explained, was just the result of the way he had managed his players’ workload. “I think it is because of the 6-2 split we’ve used on the bench in the last few games,” he said. England’s props had been playing “60, 70 minutes” every week for the last seven weeks “and a load like that will take its toll”. His props, he said, had been rotating, so were much fresher.That is a matter of strategy and it was not Jones’s only error. In days ahead, he will surely come to regret his decision to pick only two scrum-halves in his squad because once he lost Willi Heinz, he was left with a replacement, Ben Spencer, who was coming into a World Cup final with six days’ preparation.Cruel as it is to mention, Ben Youngs – one of England’s most experienced players – had his worst game of the tournament when it mattered most. But Jones did not feel able to bring Spencer on until the 75th minute, when the game had already come and gone.There is little to be gained from pointing all that out now. It was a risk and it cost him. But it does not outweigh everything else he and his team have achieved these past few weeks. Besides, as Jones said, they still had their opportunities. Especially in the five minutes they spent hammering away at South Africa’s tryline late in the first half, when they came within inches of scoring the try they so badly needed. They gave everything then, as Billy and Mako Vunipola, Courtney Lawes, Sam Underhill, Maro Itoje and the rest of them threw themselves against the South Africa defence. But it still was not enough.These are all the little details to be dealt with in the debrief. Really, England fell victim to one of the classic martial blunders. The most famous of these is “never get involved in a land war in Asia”, but only slightly less well known is this: never go in against the Springboks when the World Cup is on the line. Twenty-four years after they won their first World Cup final, 12 years after they won their second, they have won their third. In those three finals, they have not conceded a try. It is one of the most astonishing records in sport.The difference, this time, is they were led by a kid from the townships. Kolisi said he did not dream about winning the World Cup when he was young, because he was too busy dreaming about where his next meal was coming from, a captain leading a team who had more to play for than the likes of you, and I, and Eddie Jones, and England, could possibly fathom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0989c5b5059462eb4e2bdf07b2f520e58e99b7e0/0_14_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ea109d3ea8628f2b1ca5c431878c60f","title":"15 pilgrimages plilgrim trails walks europe uk","story":"Walkers of any faith or none will be inspired by our pick of historic, uplifting and long-distance pilgrimages, with transport links and places to rest weary legs each nightA thoroughly modern pilgrimage route, this 40-mile waymarked path was opened four years ago to celebrate the life of the seventh-century local heroine.

Bruno thought it was cheeky and charming and Mike sold it like a showman, but lots of errors. Craig agrees on the timing, but he loved the musical comedy. Motsi thought it lost energy but it was a lot of fun. This is a masterclass in Charleston slapstick and characterisation, which Mike is very good at.

Shirley thought the timing was completely off – I’m not sure if it was Emma’s fault or Anton’s choreography. Bruno agrees, it lacked perpetual Cuban motion but she gave it a good go. Craig wasn’t keen on the free arm placement, but the leg extension and storytelling were great. Emma looks glorious with a fringe, it really suits her.

In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.”Speaking to supporters in Iowa, he said he made the decision “reluctantly” and would stay active in the fight to defeat Trump.“I will be part of this and so will you,” he said.The three-term congressman rose to national prominence with a strong performance in a 2018 US Senate race against the Republican Ted Cruz, a contest he lost narrowly. He parlayed that run into a presidential bid which started strongly, as donors and voters were drawn to his unconventional background and energetic style.Born Robert Francis O’Rourke to a solidly Irish American family, he nonetheless had a Hiic nickname and a past including arrests and membership of a punk band which helped him stand out in a erse field. His time in Congress as a rare Texas Democrat, from a border district, was valued and his habit of giving speeches while standing on tables celebrated, before the latter tactic began to be roundly mocked.O’Rourke experienced very public misfires, including the Vanity Fair article and photoshoot and controversy over a joke about his wife, Amy, raising his children without him. Such reverses led to a public apology for his white male privilege but he never made a serious impression on the polls or in the crowded debates.O’Rourke could not match progressive favourites Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders or muster the centrist appeal of Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. Some of his policies, such as an assault-weapon buyback to stop mass shootings such as that which killed 22 people in his home town in August, were popular with liberals but prompted ferocious criticism, even threats, from Republicans in his home state and on the national stage.En route to a rally in Mississippi which he mistakenly tweeted would be in Louisiana, Trump first mocked O’Rourke in surprisingly muted tones.“Oh no,” the president wrote, “Beto just dropped out of race for president despite him saying he was ‘born for this’. I don’t think so!”He was harsher in front of a crowd, saying: “Anybody who says they were born for this, they’re in trouble.“He came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be.”O’Rourke thanked volunteers and supporters and said: “Let us continue to fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together. Whether it is ending the epidemic of gun violence or dismantling structural racism or successfully confronting climate change, we will continue to organize and mobilize and act.”He said he would support the Democratic nominee. The frontrunners in the still-unwieldy field are former vice-president Biden, senators Warren and Sanders and Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana.O’Rourke has also trailed Senator Kamala Harris, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and representative Tulsi Gabbard. But he has consistently polled ahead of senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, the pro-impeachment billionaire Tom Steyer and the former federal housing secretary Julián Castro, who all remain in the race.Candidates including Warren and Sanders were quick to send O’Rourke on his way with tweeted thanks. Most concentrated on his advocacy for gun control reform.Castro, who attacked O’Rourke on the debate stage on immigration, a key part of the former congressman’s platform, said his opponent “inspired millions of Americans … and rallied Texans and El Pasoans after the tragedy that struck his hometown”.Harris, whose own campaign has refused to catch fire after a strong start, thanked O’Rourke on Twitter “for always speaking from the heart. Your passion for your community and conviction to create a future free from gun violence have enriched this campaign and shown us the leader you are.”At 47, O’Rourke seemed to many to have a long political future, perhaps focused on the next Texas US Senate race, against the senior Republican John Cornyn. But on Friday an aide told the New York Times O’Rourke would not mount another run.That perhaps reflected a realisation that the former congressman reached too far too soon. That is certainly a view held by many of O’Rourke’s critics, that as the Daily Beast put it: “Reacting to losing to Ted Cruz by running for president is like failing to land a role in a community theatre production and deciding to take your talents to Broadway.”In a statement, the Texas Democratic party chair, Gilberto Hinojosa, called O’Rourke “a fighter, advocate and leader”.“In the wake of the El Paso shootings,” he said, “he made the entire country proud as he focused his campaign on ending gun violence and the rise of white supremacy. We thank him for his service and leadership. He made Texas proud.“Beto O’Rourke has done amazing things for the Democratic party in Texas, and we look forward to his future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ca139f0a6a5c5548795c190dbc51f54bbf803db/0_56_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2072aeecd7dc5e8dd44fe202b01d9373","title":"delta airline lgbtq booksmart rocketman olivia wilde","story":"Actor Olivia Wilde, who directed Booksmart, called out the airline on Twitter for showing edited versions of her filmThe airline Delta has said it will start showing fuller versions of the films Booksmart and Rocketman that were controversially edited to remove scenes involving LGBTQ love and sexuality.“We are working to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” a spokeswoman said.Delta faced criticism after it emerged it was showing films with edits that seemingly targeted gay and lesbian sexuality. The actor Olivia Wilde said a version of the movie Booksmart, which she directed, omitted a lesbian sex scene, a female masturbation scene, the words “vagina” and “genitals” and an animated sequence in which the two main characters turn into naked dolls. She also pointed out that the word “fuck” was not cut from the scene in which “vagina” was muted.“What message is this sending to viewers and especially to women?” Wilde wrote on Twitter. “That their bodies are obscene? That their sexuality is shameful?”Delta previously attracted opprobrium for showing a version of Rocketman, the Elton John biopic starring Tarron Egerton, which removed any reference to the musician’s sexual orientation.The airline said the edits were made, unrequested, by a third-party vendor, with Delta picking the version for in-flight viewing. It said it has now put in place new measures to ensure the movies do not omit the LGBTQ scenes.“Studios often provide videos in two forms: a theatrical, original version and an edited version,” a Delta spokeswoman said. “We selected the edited version and now realize content well within our guidelines was unnecessarily excluded from both films. We are working to make sure this doesn’t happen again.“The studio has agreed to provide a special Delta edit that retains the LGBTQ+ love scenes in both Booksmart and Rocketman that will be on our flights as soon as possible.”Wilde said thank you on Twitter.The spokeswoman said it was not Delta’s practice to omit LGBTQ love scenes, pointing to fuller in-flight versions of series and movies including Gentleman Jack and Moonlight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70ae7b5aade5da45436362ad5d70874d56696307/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b25258b754cc0a7922d9a86bb69636af","title":"car bomb explodes in syrian town captured by turkey from kurds","story":"At least 13 people killed in explosion in northern border town of Tal AbyadA car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town along the border with Turkey on Saturday, killing 13 people. Turkey’s defence ministry said about 20 others were wounded when the bomb exploded in central Tal Abyad, which forces backed by Ankara captured from Kurdish-led fighters last month.The ministry harshly condemned the attack, which it blamed on Syrian Kurdish fighters, and called on the international community to take a stance against this “cruel terror organisation”. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.Turkey invaded north-eastern Syria last month to push out Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom it considers terrorists because of their links to a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said earlier on Saturday that Christian fighters would now oversee security in a northern Syrian region where troops backed by Turkey have clashed with and Kurdish-led militias.The SDF said the deployment would take place in villages close to the town of Tal Tamr in the Khabur river region. The area is home to Syria’s dwindling Christian Syriac and Assyrian communities.Until Turkey launched its offensive\u0026nbspthere on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish.\u0026nbspSince the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by\u0026nbspTurkey\u0026nbspand its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.On 17 October Turkish president,\u0026nbspRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara’s operation for\u0026nbsp five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish “safe zone” in Syria.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\u0026nbspIn late 2014, the\u0026nbspKurds were struggling\u0026nbspto fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside\u0026nbspTurkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s\u0026nbsprecent announcement\u0026nbspthat American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.Turkey’s advance into northern Syria has led to the displacement of about 200,000 people. There have been concerns in Christian villages about possible atrocities committed by fighters backed by Ankara, some of whom are former jihadists.The SDF said it was deploying the Syriac Military Council and Assyrian fighters in the Khabur river region. Both groups are part of the SDF.The announcement came a day after Turkey and Russia launched joint patrols in north-eastern Syria under a deal that halted a Turkish offensive against Syrian Kurdish fighters, who were forced to withdraw from the border area following Ankara’s incursion.The truce has mostly held, but it has been marred by accusations of violations from both sides and occasional clashes. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has threatened to resume the offensive if he deems it necessary.The Syrian Kurds had been Washington’s top allies in the fight against Islamic State, a relationship that had strained ties between the US and Turkey, which are both members of Nato.After an abrupt and widely criticised decision by Donald Trump to withdraw US troops from this part of Syria, Kurdish forces approached the Syrian government and Russia for protection. Syrian government troops and Russian military police subsequently moved into areas along the border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6709699e16f83471b99ac525c10895b2a528455/0_316_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8207f9abdf1643a1d600e80dae38ded","title":"uk social integration agenda abandoned by government says former tsar","story":"Community cohesion has been effectively abandoned by the government, according to a former integration tsar who says the approach is typified by the prime minister comparing Muslim women wearing burkas to “letter boxes”.Speaking three years after producing a hard-hitting report into ministers’ failure to tackle social cohesion, Dame Louise Casey said the gap between the haves and have-nots had widened, communities had become more ided and Muslim women remained the most marginalised group in the UK.Casey said that since her 2016 report grievances and prejudice had deepened and toxic views had become more normalised, describing Boris Johnson’s “letter box”  column last year as “absolutely extraordinary”.Casey’s report, commissioned by former prime minister David Cameron, advocated initiatives to encourage immigrants to embrace British values, and promote social mixing among young people.“If you look at the data then and now, little has changed. The brave domestic agenda has been forgotten with universal credit and working-level poverty absolutely symbolic of the country’s dissonance between the rich and poor,” she said.Her key recommendation of teaching English as a second language had been broadly sidelined, Casey said.“It needs to be a flood of resources, not just a drop here, a drop there. I would set a target that says in five years’ time we want everybody in the country to be able to speak a common language. We’re all in this together.” Her report found that people from black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups were three times more likely than white British people to be unemployed, with economic inactivity levels unusually high among women from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.Casey said the situation for many Muslim women had not improved. They still faced a toxic blend of challenges stemming from their gender, their belonging to a community facing hate crime and Islamophobia, as well as sexist, misogynistic and patriarchal behaviour from within their own communities. “It is still so difficult for Muslim women to stand up and be counted,” she said.Casey said young Muslim women should be able to believe that they could emulate the success of BBC presenter Mishal Husain. “When every Asian girl of Muslim heritage has eyes on Mishal Husain, we’re game on. My integration job is over,” said Casey.Integration expert Fiyaz Mughal said that the government’s response to Casey’s review, which also advocated an “integration oath” to encourage immigrants to embrace British values, had been poor.Mughal, founder of interfaith group Faith Matters, said: “The government’s response has been too half-hearted and not thought through.”He said ministerial lethargy over the issue had helped contribute to the societal rancour and increase in hate crimes recorded during the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum. “It’s part of the reason why the ide in our country opened up so quickly after Brexit, partly because there wasn’t anything strong binding us together, these things can unravel quickly You have to be constantly assisting cohesion,” said Mughal.Casey said that the left should accept some of the blame for failing to speak up on behalf of Muslim women for fear of being labelled Islamophobic. This had prevented them from challenging misogynistic and patriarchal behaviour in some minority communities, she added.“The left should be shouting from the rooftops for these women, not being quiet about it. I think people get really confused about being anti-religious. They’re worried about being called racist, but it’s not about faith, it’s about equalities, poverty and deprivation,” said the former civil servant, who is promoting the global homelessness event The Big Sleep Out.Casey, head of the former rough sleepers’ unit introduced by Tony Blair, also said that the liberal response to the high-profile row over a long campaign to halt LGBT equality messages being taught in a Birmingham school indicated a lack of progress and confidence in defending and encouraging British values.“I will fight for the right for a Muslim to dress however she wants, but I’ll also fight for the right for Steve to be married to Steve,” she said. “We have to be able to be both – that’s being British, that’s our values and what we fight for – and it’s not an either or.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def00028a8e841e36f4d9d7c89be25789f48a064/48_88_1661_996/master/1661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b75d5ca1f599a72c26f685653e33346e","title":"did i ever really know him the women who married gay men","story":"A Sydney counselling service is filling in what’s often missing in the married man coming out narrative – the woman’s voice Megan Holgate couldn’t quite believe where she was.It was the waiting room of an inner-city STI clinic, frequented by those most at risk of HIV, at the height of the Aids crisis: gay men, injecting drug users, sex workers.Not, as she had been, a monogamous married businesswoman.She had felt “too ashamed” to ask her doctor for the HIV test. A positive result, back then, would have been a death sentence.In the clinic, a friendly gay counsellor asked Megan to step into his room, and asked her if everything was OK. No, she said. No, it absolutely was not.“That’s when I lost the plot,” Megan, now 52, tells me as we sit in a gastrobar on a rainy Sydney evening. “This poor gay guy was the target for all my built-up anger.”Megan threw her chair across the room at the petrified counsellor, first screaming, then crying, then sobbing until – now outside Sydney’s Albion Street clinic, she vomited on the street. People gave her a cautious, wide berth.Her worried dad was on his way to pick up his distraught daughter – now lying in the gutter, covered in her own tears and vomit.“At that moment, a homeless man I’d stepped over on the way in reached out to gently check in on me” Megan says, crying.She softened it was the first tender moment she’d experienced in a period of terrifying isolation. “I’ve never forgotten him” Megan says. As her dad pulled up, she opened her purse, fat with notes, and pushed them all into the bewildered man’s hands before being whisked home.Megan is one of a potentially dying breed of women: those who married closeted gay men. As countries such as Australia and Britain progress towards LGBTQI equality, it’s a social phenomenon that could vaporise within a generation.When a married man comes out later in life, positive reactions can be heartening. Rainbow garlands are unfurled. People applaud his bravery. They empathise with his struggle. They marvel at how he came through it and celebrate that he can finally be himself. They express gratitude we live in more enlightened times.Often entirely missing from this narrative is the woman’s voice.She has had to face her marriage breakdown and potential infidelity, and wrestle with feelings that her relationship was a sham. Then there’s the judgment of others who, sometimes openly, say surely she must have suspected – how naive can a person be? Occasionally she is blamed for being the person holding the man back from who he truly is or wants to be.Just one service in Australia specifically exists to help these women: the Women Partners of Bisexual Men service, run by the Leichhardt Women’s Centre in Sydney. It’s believed to be one of the only government-funded services of its kind in the world.To mark its 25th anniversary, the service is releasing a new book, There’s Something I Have To Tell You, featuring 20 stories from the women’s perspective.One hundred women of all ages and backgrounds use the service, comprising group support and specialised inidual counselling. One woman, Annabel, flies to Sydney from Melbourne fortnightly especially for the peer group sessions. “A few times I was in foetal position bawling and had drank too much wine” she says. “So I was extremely grateful for the group.”Roxanne McMurray has been running the support service for 19 years. Daily she hears “heartbreaking stories” like Megan’s.She says women present with depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, high blood pressure, eating issues and fears their children will be bullied. “Some women contact the service before their husband is even aware they know he’s gay,” she says. “Some women found out because they were diagnosed with HIV or another STI. And yes, some women say the group saved their lives they were suicidal when they contacted us.”Megan says a service like this would have been a “lifesaver”. She suffered a nervous breakdown after discovering her husband’s secret. “If I didn’t have our daughter, Lucy, I can understand how you’d be suicidal after that level of deception” she says.Steven, Megan’s husband, had been a high-flying, jet-setting schmoozer who rose from a socially conservative family in Sydney’s western suburbs to be a financial director on a seven-figure salary.He first met Megan, his second wife, when she was 22 and he was 26. After their first date, he sent four dozen roses to her work. “It was OTT but I was swept away,” Megan says. “I grew up with real Aussie blokes – this was something I’d never experienced.”After their wedding, when the couple were living in Hong Kong for work, Steven pushed her to have a baby, even though she wasn’t entirely happy in the relationship. Never once did she suspect he was gay. “We had a pretty normal healthy sex life, it’s not like it was once a year. If I had a dollar for everyone who asked: are you sure you didn’t know?” she says, sighing.Eight weeks after their daughter Lucy was born, the relationship nose-ed. “I thought he was having an affair, and created a big fight to get it out of him,” she says. “Finally he said, ‘I’m not attracted to you, I have some feelings towards men. I’m not gay but really confused and I think I need you to move back to Australia so I can work myself out.’”Through tears, Megan describes her world collapsing. “I was a woman deranged,” she says. “I was devastated, yet somehow also relieved the problem wasn’t me, as he’d often made me feel.”On the plane home, she took stock: “In 24 hours I lost my husband, marriage, home, friends, support group, career. And I had an eight-week-old baby.”She later discovered her husband was on a flight the next day to the Caribbean with his male lover. “He was a pathological liar,” Megan says. “I was so angry – I could understand how a woman could kill her husband,” she says.A year later, Megan realised she needed to let go of the anger, when she collapsed with internal bleeding caused by a stress-related ulcer. “I decided to stop hating him,” she says.Steven got a new boyfriend, who Megan adored. “He was a beautiful man, and wonderful to my daughter Lucy,” she says.Both Steven and his partner died of Aids-related illnesses.Clearly distraught, Megan stops the interview as she describes watching the men become paraplegic, then die. “Such a waste. Me and my daughter are so sad,” she says. Lucy, now 24, hid at school the fact her dad was gay. “Now she’d be the coolest kid in school,” Megan says. “They’d go shopping they’d have a ball.”But she admits to hoping for a deathbed confession. “I always dreamt I’d finally get the truth. Why marry me? I don’t believe in bisexuality, I think he was gay,” she says. “When you love someone and you know you’re gay, you don’t marry them. That’s wrong, to me.”Megan’s experience chimes with many of the moving stories in the new book, which aims to increase the reach of the Women Partners of Bisexual Men service – it will be sent to counsellors, family relationship services and lawyers across Australia.Common themes emerge from their 20 stories. More than once the phrase appears that “he stole my life”. One woman, Beth, describes the discovery as “17 years stolen from me.”The physical impact of the sheer shock on these women is confronting. Lucy’s hair fell out, she had tremors and experienced dramatic weight loss. “Everyone was telling me how great I looked!” she writes. “I kept thinking: I’m dying. The only man who’d ever been attracted to me actually hadn’t been, so all those horrible thoughts I’d felt about myself were actually true.”Some describe feeling like widows the men they knew were apparitions. And many of the men, emboldened by the sense of freedom and fresh excitement afforded them by discovering the gay scene, completely transformed.Amal describes the impact it had on her children: “My sons’ friends would come over and ask, is your dad gay? The way he walked, sat, smiled, dressed – all changed.” Many times the women are left questioning: who is he did I ever really know him?Those who were gaslighted describe relief that they weren’t, after all, going mad for suspecting. Others, convinced the problem was their own inadequacy, describe similar complex relief. But that relief is often accompanied by anger.Several women, half-jokingly, discuss hiring hitmen. When Amal discovered her husband had been bringing his secret boyfriend of five years to the house – even to sit at family dinners under the guise of a friend – she “called him a disgusting creature”, she writes. “They’re manipulative because they’re ashamed of who they are, but the woman pays the price.”The insensitivity of celebrating the man’s coming out is something many women grapple with. “I get angry because everyone’s said to him how fantastic, aren’t you courageous, what a hero,” writes Beth. “I wanted to beat the living shit out of him for what he did to our family. There were no repercussions for him. My anger was mind-blowing.”Similarly, Patricia took issue with the blokes who took her husband out for a beer so they didn’t look homophobic. “If he’d shot me, would they take him out for a beer?,” she asks. “That’s what it felt like.”Other people’s positive reactions to the coming-out can cause unintended pain, such as in Lucy’s case. Her husband’s parents responded by saying he wouldd always be their son. “That hit me hard,” she admits. “I realised yes, he’d always be their son. But I wouldn’t be their daughter any more.”Some reactions are more surprising. Service manager Roxanne says a post-disclosure honeymoon period can happen, and sex begins again because it brings back emotional intimacy. Such was the case for Madeleine: “Interestingly, after it came out, we had a brief spurt of sex together. The first time it happened, I cried. It had been eight years.”Just like many gay men do, their wives can go through denial periods, Roxanne says, believing they can work things out. For some like Val, they make a conscious or practical decision to stay her husband was 72 when she found out.Pam, whose main concern upon discovering was protecting her husband from losing his friends, also concedes she’ll probably stay with him. For her, it’s all about sacrificing one thing to get something else – in this case, a continuing family for her children: “I know my husband is gay, he can’t stop himself from being with men, it’s impossible. I’m realistic. We talk a lot.”Elizabeth is reflective on how she ended up with her husband: “There’s a stereotype that closeted men seek out a certain type of woman because we have qualities of acceptance, tolerance, understanding, empathy – but even if it’s true, you don’t want to feel like you’re gullible” she writes. She even picked him up from his first date with a man. Her anger wasn’t at him, but at his family and culture for not letting him be who he should have been in the first place: “It was like he didn’t know how to be gay.”Roxanne remembers, as Australia’s marriage equality postal vote was happening, clients contacting the service asking, have you done it yet, have you voted? I ask her if any were no voters, given their experiences. “Absolutely not,” she says. “They were enthusiastic about creating a new world – so no other woman would go through what they did.”Megan Holgate relates to that. She remembers being unable to go to Mardi Gras one year her colleagues invited her, as the sight of two men kissing was just too distressing. Today, she cheers such affection: “I think, go for it. You’ve met someone you love that’s what makes the world go round.”On that point, I recall the book’s most poignant line. It comes from Lucy, who – in her acute distress – did the most intrusive thing a person can do to invade another’s privacy: she found and read her husband’s teenage diary.

Photograph: Crispin RodwellA community of nuns in Dublin has avoided having to pay a vacant site levy by claiming a meadow was used as a location for exercise and prayer.The Carmelite order has successfully challenged a decision of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to place an overgrown field they own near Stillorgan on the vacant site register in December 2018.The nuns claimed a circular path surrounding the site at the Carmelite Monastery of St Joseph on Kilmacud Road Upper was in regular use for exercise and prayer.The local authority believed the 1.64 hectare site should be registered as vacant as it was not in use and situated in an area where there was a need for housing as well as being zoned for residential development.The council also noted that only 1.85 per cent of its administrative area’s housing stock was for sale or rent in October 2018, with the average three-bed home costing €567,110 or €2,612 in monthly rent.Council officials claimed the land was not being used in the most efficient and effective manner possible, and that it was not being put to the most productive and appropriate use in the interests of the common good.They said an inspection of the site found minimal evidence that the site was being used for amenity purposes.While the council said the meadow might provide an environment “conducive of tranquil reflection, passive thought and allow for silence and solitude”, it did not consider that should be a basis for allowing a greenfield site zoned for residential development and located in a built-up suburban location to remain vacant.The contemplative order appealed the decision to An Bord Pleanála, claiming zoning allowed for a residential institution.Nuns’ caseThe Carmelites pointed out that a site should not be deemed vacant under planning legislation if the most recent purchase of the land occurred before it was zoned for residential use.They said they had owned the land since 1892 and its retention was most important for the longevity and amenity of the Carmelite order.The nuns said the site was in active use as both a residence and a place of worship.As a contemplative order, they said reflective prayer was done in the grounds of the monastery.In upholding the appeal by the Carmelites, An Bord Pleanála ruled the meadow was part of the nuns’ “home” under planning legislation.The board said the area of land was a garden used for amenity purposes associated with the Carmelite community and was therefore not vacant or idle.It also found there was an absence of sufficient appropriate records to support the council’s contention that the meadow was vacant for a 12-month period before it was placed on the vacant site register as the local authority had relied in part on Google Earth aerial photography.An inspector with An Bord Pleanála said the site was “an integral part of the monastery complex”.Under legislation, the owner of lands registered as a vacant site was liable for a levy of 3 per cent of its market value this year with the rate increasing to 7 per cent from January 2020."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Video: Simon Carswell \u0026 Enda O\u0027DowdLorry driver Tony Grady has lost count of the number of times he has taken his truck on the ferry from Scotland to Northern Ireland, but he can remember how many times he has undergone a customs check.The answer? “Never,” he says.All that may change if the Brexit withdrawal agreement negotiated by UK prime minister Boris Johnson with the EU ever becomes law.The complex, untested plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland with the UK’s departure from the EU would keep Northern Ireland legally in the UK customs union but practically under EU customs rules.How that might work is anyone’s guess given that there is little operational detail in the 64-page Brexit “protocol” for Northern Ireland, published ahead of the UK’s planned exit from the EU on January 31st. There is a broad outline: the UK would collect tariffs for Brussels on EU-bound goods moving from Scotland to Northern Ireland, and Northern Irish firms would be able to reclaim tariffs on goods staying in the North.Pushing a customs border from the land border on the island of Ireland to a border in the Irish Sea has left those who will face the greatest burden of navigating these arrangements – lorry drivers – flummoxed.“I don’t really see that working. You are not going to hold up a port,” says Grady, as he drives in the darkness of the breaking Scottish dawn towards Cairnryan to catch the 10.30am P\u0026ampO ferry to Larne.This sea journey is, at just two hours, the quickest crossing between Ireland and Britain, explaining why roughly 10 per cent of the roll-on, roll-off freight moving between the two islands takes this route.About 550 lorries crossed on this route on average every day in 2018, according to data gathered by the Irish Maritime Development Office. There are seven sailings every weekday between Larne and Cairnryan.Fresh produce\u0026nbspThe branded lorries of Tesco, Asda and Marks \u0026amp Spencer driving into this small port village reflect its popularity for next-day deliveries, which keep the shelves of the major supermarket chains stocked with fresh produce.“We will definitely be the most affected if we are going to get held up,” says the Co Antrim-based driver, who is transporting pasta and beans that originated in Italy and are destined for a major supermarket chain.“Goods are not going to get delivered. Customers may go elsewhere,” he says, adding that traders may decide to move goods destined for the North directly from mainland Europe to the Republic and then across the Border, thereby avoiding Britain.His food shipment landed in freight containers at the port of Felixstowe on the east coast of England the previous day. The final leg of Grady’s journey started at 5am in Carlisle, 180km south of Cairnryan.From a practical point of view, Grady cannot see customs working in this small Scottish village port, or the two shipping companies – P\u0026ampO and Stena Line, which serve Larne and Belfast respectively – tolerating checks.He believes checks could lead to a queue of traffic down the road to a nearby link road where trucks are often parked, with no facilities if bad weather prevents a ferry sailing.“We are a bit of a thick lot we just won’t put up with it,” he said.Grady arrives at the check-in kiosk, where a P\u0026ampO staff member asks the names of the passengers and what kind of goods he is carrying. A minute later he is on his way and the truck is the first in a queue of about 100 lorries.“They don’t need to know where it has come from – just what’s in it,” he says, driving away from the kiosk.“I just don’t think it will change. We will still move things but slower. It may just be a day late. Hauliers will just bill people for an extra day.”‘Unfettered access’The proposed Brexit deal says that nothing in the agreement prevents the UK from ensuring “unfettered access” for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK’s internal market.Drivers travelling the Cairnryan-Larne route are not so sure. They have little faith in the word of Boris Johnson or his cabinet. In three days after the publication of the proposals, four UK government ministers offered seven different answers to questions about what checks would apply on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Britain.The government has conceded – much to the anger of Northern Ireland’s unionist politicians – that an exit summary declaration would be required on goods moving west to east if the North followed the EU’s customs code.For goods going the other direction, from east to west, the government has said customs declarations will lead to extra costs for companies in terms of paying customs brokers. The government estimated this could cost between £15 (€17) and £56 per declaration, depending on whether a Northern Irish company used an external customs agent.“It will make a mess of the Northern Ireland economy,” says Philip Murphy, a lorry driver from Newry, Co Down, who is hauling animal feed from Hull, a northern English port, to Newtownards near Belfast.Like other drivers, Murphy cannot see the proposed arrangements working. Most drivers arrive to catch the ferry at the last minute, he says. He believes checks will cause havoc for highly regulated driving time limits monitored by electronic devices in trucks called tachographs.“Between tachograph rules and everything else you have to go through, to start border checks again, it is not going to work,” he says.Another driver, sitting in the waiting area of the P\u0026ampO terminal building at Cairnryan, wonders how they are going to impose an external EU border within the UK.“It’s UK here, it’s UK there,” he says, pointing towards Northern Ireland. “What’s the border doing here?”Murphy is more concerned that fears about potential unrest among republicans reacting to a hard border on the island of Ireland has been replaced by anxieties around the reaction of loyalists to a border in the Irish Sea.“I just think it is going to create trouble in the North. One side doesn’t want one thing and the other side doesn’t want the other,” he says.“It would take very little to kick off the Troubles again something like this here could kick it off.”Regulatory frontierOutside the trucker loung on P\u0026ampO\u0027s European Highlander frery, midway between Scotland and Northern Ireland, another lorry driver – who does not want to give his name – has plenty to say about the latest Brexit deal.“This is the border boat,” he says.The ferry will be where goods cross the new post-Brexit customs and regulatory frontier, he notes, describing the proposed arrangements as “a disaster”.Pushing regulatory checks to the Irish Sea to align North and South on EU single market rules, thereby avoiding land border checks, could mean delays up to 24 hours on food deliveries heading to Northern Ireland. He says deliveries will have to be signed off by a veterinary inspector working to EU sanitary rules before being transported.To guarantee the same supply of agrifood, he estimates that three lorries will be required to do the work two lorries do now, adding to costs. There will also be a mountain of new paperwork to fill out.“It is unworkable but it is going to come. There is going to have to be some way of doing it,” he says.“Personally I think – and this has nothing to do with politics – a land border would have been better because there is an established routine of doing paperwork between two countries. Now they are making up a whole new set-up and nobody knows what they are doing.”Grady’s boss, Alan Blair, who runs his own haulage business out of Ballymena, Co Antrim, believes he will be going back in time 20 years if he has fill in paperwork.He questions why he has to complete any kind of paperwork, even exit declarations listing the contents of his trucks, if one of his lorries transports a load from Belfast to London when Belfast is in the UK.“It will be an absolute nightmare if we have to fill out paperwork. It has to continue the way it is,” he says.One of his meat exporters points out that under these new arrangements, he will have to give three days’ notice of exports where his current system involves the sale of produce for next-day delivery.The proposed arrangements will prove “impossible” for Northern Ireland’s businesses, he says.‘Build a bridge’Most truckers on the ferry route express puzzlement about how the Brexit plan will work, including hauliers who transport large number of different products known as “groupage”.One Donegal driver, PJ Carr, who is moving concrete from Letterkenny to Scotland, shrugs his shoulders when asked where his goods might be checked given that there will be no checks at the Irish Border.Another trucker doubts the plan, too.“I don’t know if it will work or not, but it will hold the whole process up,” says Ian Duff, who transports engineering parts from Co Antrim to various parts of England on his lorry.“We have timed deliveries. It will affect everything. Our customers will be complaining.”He believes checks could be done electronically, rather than through a manual or physical exercise.More generally, Duff does not like how the deal separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.“That isolates Northern Ireland. That completely puts us in no-man’s land. The Border is between the North and the South it is not between Northern Ireland and Scotland or mainland England,” he says.Duff believes there is a better option.“With Boris anything is possible,” he says in response to an idea that has been widely dismissed.Just over two hours after leaving Cairnryan, Tony Grady climbs into the cab of his lorry and, a few minutes later, is driving down the ramp off the ferry.At Larne he passes two men in luminous yellow jackets, agricultural inspectors who might ask about any fresh fruit or vegetables he transports. He says that in his 20 years driving he has never had a load actually checked here.At the exit to the port, he does not even have to stop his lorry to give a security guard his exit ticket he hands the ticket out the window of the passing truck.“He wants your ticket – that’s it,” says Grady before heading for Ballymena with his load of pasta and beans in tow.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File image: Brian LawlessPA WireThe Democratic Unionist Party will step aside for their rivals the Ulster Unionist Party in the Fermanagh South Tyrone constituency.DUP leader Arlene Foster made the announcement as the UUP comes under pressure to make a reciprocal gesture by not running a candidate against her deputy Nigel Dodds in North Belfast. In a statement on Saturday, Mrs Foster said she believes in unionist co-operation and parties working together to maximise representation.But incoming UUP leader Steve Aiken has indicated he is not in favour of participating in unionist pacts for the December 12th poll.A unionist pact saw Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott win the Fermanagh South Tyrone Westminster seat in 2015, but Sinn Féin’s Michelle Gildernew won the seat back in 2017.Mrs Foster said: “The people of Fermanagh and South Tyrone deserve to be represented in the House of Commons rather than an absentee MP standing on the sidelines.“Despite the DUP being the largest unionist party in the constituency, it is right to put wider interest ahead of narrow party politics and indicate our support for Tom Elliott to re-take this seat.“This is something voters from across the unionist community want to see happening and we will be urging DUP supporters to put their full weight behind Tom’s campaign.“Every vote will matter in this election and the votes of Northern Ireland MPs could again be crucial in the new Parliament.“It is more important than ever to have MPs who will turn up and speak up for their constituents where it matters — inside the House of Commons.”Sinn Féin last week singled out Mr Dodds, who won a majority of just over 2,000 votes in North Belfast in 2017, as one of its key targets as it aims to increase its number of MPs from seven to eight.It emerged last week that police are investigating threats again Ulster Unionist staff members over the electoral pact row. Mr Dodds, who was canvassing in North Belfast on Saturday, said any threats issued towards members and activists from the UUP were “deplorable and must be totally condemned”.In a statement on Friday night, he said: “The only appropriate way to express your views and the most effective way to send a message in our society is through the ballot box.” Sinn Féin’s policing spokesman Gerry Kelly MLA, who ran unsuccessfully for the party in Westminster elections in North Belfast before he was replaced by Mr Finucane, said: “It’s been reported that threats against UUP staff members have been issued by elements within the UDA.“This group has recently been involved in murder, extortion, threats and intimidation.“This is a time for political leadership - people should be free to campaign politically without fear of intimidation.” - Additional reporting PA"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Ankara blames Kurdish militia for fatal assault in town held by Turkish-backed forcesThe demise of Islamic State, and its underpinning ideology, remain a long way offMainly peaceful rallies in Lebanon contrast with violence and fatalities in IraqMilitant group identifies largely unknown Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi as successorErbil Letter: A gentleman\u0026rsquos club believes style affords an identity beyond politics and faithYazidi woman Naveen Rasho was held captive by Isis and wound up in al-Hawl campRevolutionaries calling for non-sectarian, neutral PM in country plagued by corruptionSaad Hariri to step down after two weeks of nationwide mass demonstrationsPolice fire tear gas, live ammunition to disperse demonstrators in Baghdad, Kerbala\u0026lsquoVicious and violent\u0026rsquo death proof of US\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquorelentless pursuit of terrorist leaders\u0026rsquoCountry remains gridlocked as unprecedented demonstrations target political classAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi took his life after he was chased down tunnel, US president saysSecurity forces lobbed tear gas to try to disperse demonstrators in BaghdadArmy fire into the air during incident with demonstrators near TripoliSupporters clash with anti-government protesters, forcing riot police to interveneDemonstrators march towards Baghdad\u0026rsquos Green Zone as they rally against corruptionMichel Aoun makes televised appeal as banks remain closed for seventh day\u0026lsquoAll the countries betrayed us...How could they leave us?

Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesScotland’s future is “on the line” in December’s general election, Nicola Sturgeon said as she called on Scots to back her party in that ballot to send a “resounding message” to Westminster.The Scottish first minister and SNP leader urged Scots to “demand the right to choose a better future”.Ms Sturgeon has already put the issue of a second independence referendum — which she wants to hold next year — at the heart of the SNP’s election campaign.And as she addressed a rally of independence supporters in Glasgow’s George Square, she called on voters to “demand the right to choose an independent future for Scotland” on December 12th.The event, which was staged by the pro-independence newspaper The National, was the first such rally that Ms Sturgeon has addressed since the referendum campaign of 2014.According to the organisers, 20,000 people packed into the city centre square to hear the first minister and other speakers, including Scottish Brexit Secretary Mike Russell and Mhairi Black MP.The first minister told the crowd: “The general election that we face now on December 12 is the most important election for Scotland in our lifetimes. The future of our country is on the line, and there is no doubt whatsoever that Scotland stands at a crossroads moment.”There were boos from the audience when she claimed a victory for Boris Johnson in the election would result in “a future where Scotland gets ripped out of our European family of nations against our will, a future where the UK turns in on itself, a future of a hostile environment for migrants”.And instead, she said: “There is a much better alternative. And that alternative is not a UK Labour government that can’t event make up its mind where it stands on the question of Brexit.”Earlier on Saturday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had argued against Scottish independence, saying if he was voted into Downing Street £70 billion of capital spending money would come to Scotland, as well as extra cash for health and education.Mr Corbyn told reporters: “We want to see Scotland’s economy improve and the levels of poverty in Scotland, particularly in big cities, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, being reduced.“It’s a Labour government that will do that. Scottish independence would mean a massive gap between what Scotland raises in taxation and what the Scottish people need at the present time.“I think the much better option is a Labour government for the whole of the UK.”But Ms Sturgeon insisted: “The better alternative, the much better alternative for our country, is to take our future into our hands and to become an independent country.“To invest in our people, and invest in our public services, and invest in lifting children out of poverty, not in a hard Brexit, not in Trident weapons of mass destruction on the River Clyde.”She added: “We must come out in our numbers and vote in this election, vote to escape the chaos and the misery and the ision of Brexit and vote to put Scotland’s future into Scotland’s hands.” - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4069246.1572610512!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk election six possible results and how they d affect brexit","story":"Nigel Farage has told Boris Johnson to drop the Brexit deal and join his party in a Leave alliance or face a challenge from  the Brexit Party in the forthcoming general election.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Conservative leader Boris Johnson.

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK – so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was the first movie I ever made and so I thought, ‘I don’t really feel worthy of this.’“So I stuck it up in my attic for a while. But it’s now beautifully displayed in my office.”Fellow guest Reese Witherspoon said that she empathised, as she had once “tucked away” her own Best Actress Oscar for the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” 120 The Wizard of Oz (1939)All the tricks and gimmicks of today’s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz’s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema’s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation.

But a pair of recent scandals prove that stacks of cash need not be involved. The line can be crossed even with fruits and vegetables.Two ministers in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have resigned in the past week, less than two months into their tenures, after they were accused of the less-than-monumental offence of giving produce to voters.The first to go was Isshu Sugawara, the trade minister, who was accused of sending cantaloupes and crab –​ luxury items that can be quite expensive in Japan – to constituents, as well as improperly paying about $185 (£143) as a funeral condolence gift to a voter.Six days later, the justice minister, Katsuyuki Kawai, stepped down after a report that he had re-gifted potatoes to some constituents that he had received from a fellow politician. His wife, Anri Kawai, a candidate for Parliament, was also accused of paying double the legal limit of about $140 (£108) a day to staff members who travel in vans shouting campaign slogans.Both revelations came in the Weekly Bunshun, a news magazine. The two ministers have not acknowledged any wrongdoing, but both stepped down quickly, they said, because they did not want investigations interfering with governing.Created with Sketch.Japan in bloom: cherry blossoms in 2019 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cherry blossom-watching on the Meguro RiverBlossom along the Meguro River in TokyoIlluminated cherry trees with the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower in the distanceIlluminated cherry trees along the Meguro RiverCherry blossom along the Chidorigafuchi MoatAdmiring cherry blossoms during a tea ceremony in YokohamaTaking a selfie underneath the cherry blossom in YokohamaJapanese Emperor Akihito, left, and Empress Michiko see weeping cherry in KyotoCherry blossom in Asakusa, TokyoCherry blossom-watching on the Meguro RiverBlossom along the Meguro River in TokyoIlluminated cherry trees with the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower in the distanceIlluminated cherry trees along the Meguro RiverCherry blossom along the Chidorigafuchi MoatAdmiring cherry blossoms during a tea ceremony in YokohamaTaking a selfie underneath the cherry blossom in YokohamaJapanese Emperor Akihito, left, and Empress Michiko see weeping cherry in KyotoCherry blossom in Asakusa, TokyoThe swift exits indicated that Mr Abe is keeping a tight rein on anything that could destabilise his government as he is poised later this month to become the longest-serving prime minister in Japan’s history. But the departures also reflect the country’s by-the-book approach to following rules. In Japan, political gift-giving is simply not allowed.“It is not a matter of whether it is 10,000 yen or 1 million yen,” said Hiroshi Shiratori, a professor of political science at Hosei University in Tokyo. “Even if it is 10 yen or 100 yen, it is a bit problematic for politicians to step over the rules.”“In a sense,” Mr Shiratori said, “we are a very serious nation.”Not only are the Japanese serious about avoiding graft, they are serious too about giving gifts. That may have been a factor in the undoing of the two ministers. Bestowing gifts is an\u0026nbspimportant part of Japanese culture.Japan says prime minister’s name is Abe Shinzo, not Shinzo AbeAny time employees or family members go on a trip, no matter how brief, they are expected to bring back souvenirs known as omiyage. Guests never arrive empty-handed. Companies give midyear and year-end gifts (ochugen and oseibo) to clients. And the custom of bringing money to a funeral helps families defray costs small tokens like tea or dried seaweed are usually offered in return.Japan’s establishment has enforced the strict rules on political gift-giving ever since notorious multimillion-dollar scandals rocked Japan in the 1970s and ’80s. The rules, which include precise limits on compensation for campaign staff members, are intended to prevent the wealthy from gaining an unfair advantage in politics.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was found guilty in 1983 of accepting bribes then worth about $2.1m (£1.6m) to arrange the purchase of Lockheed aircraft by All Nippon Airways.Another scandal involving corruption by political and business leaders and a real estate firm called Recruit Cosmo shook the establishment in the early 1990s.But some wonder if the cut-and-dried approach of today misses the point.“I think this has to do with the Japanese way of obsessively following the rules while refusing to see the bigger picture and problems behind them,” said Yujin Yaguchi, a professor of American studies at the University of Tokyo.Still, others said the strict adherence to campaign finance laws was a positive contrast to places like the United States.“I think it’s a healthy sign for Japanese democracy that the government feels that even what we might see as relatively minor infractions of campaign finance rules is taken very seriously and results in the resignation of top ministers,” said Phillip Lipscy, director of the Centre for the Study of Global Japan at the University of Toronto.“It’s very different from the US, where government officials are able to dig in and get through what appear to be much more serious accusations of influence peddling and corruption,” he added.Not every Japanese politician hits the exit at the first suggestion of wrongdoing, though. Mr Abe himself has hung on to power through several influence-peddling scandals that threatened his political standing last year.After a brief, scandal-ridden stint as prime minister from 2006 to 2007, he returned to power in 2012. Analysts said he may have learned from his first shot at power how to cut his losses.“Deprive the scandal of oxygen,” said Tobias Harris, an expert on Japanese politics at Teneo Intelligence in Washington, and “don’t give the opposition the opportunity to hijack the proceedings.”The islands that are 1,000km from Tokyo but still part of the cityThis week’s resignations have a precedent under Mr Abe. In 2014, Yuko Obuchi, then the economics minister, resigned after giving voters wine and discounted tickets to Kabuki theatre\u0026nbspperformances. (She was also found guilty of failing to report about $241,000 (£186,000) in fundraising.)Also that year, Midori Matsushima, then the justice minister, resigned after handing out to voters paper fans embossed with her name.There have been second acts, however.Itsunori Onodera resigned as a member of Parliament in 2000 after he was found guilty of violating the public election law when his secretary offered voters boxes of incense with his name on them. After Mr Onodera won back his seat, Mr Abe appointed him defence minister both in 2012 and again in 2017.“Voters forgive candidates after they make an apology,” said Yukiko Miki, chair of the nonprofit organisation Access-Info Clearing House Japan, which advocates more transparency in government. “They rather put a priority on what a candidate would do for them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens.

Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour.

What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

No debate.This extremism is feeding into real-le events, including the campaign for next month’s General Election. Just look at the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn.Despite presenting himself as a kind and compassionate old bean, Corbyn and most MPs in the current Labour Party thrive on presenting society as a fight between “good” and “evil”, the “few” and “many”, with people like bankers and Tories in the latter group.At every chance they demonise anyone who strays from the progressive orthodoxy.Labour’s shouty MP David Lammy even took this philosophy so far as to compare Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit European Research Group to “Nazis” and “apartheid”.In reality, they are simply politicians who have dferent views to him.But such extreme rhetoric has become normalised among Labour. You are either on their side of the argument, or you are a fascist.Labour’s polarised world view is encapsulated in its utterly bonkers set of policies.Any sensible government knows that economic reform takes time, and is often about compromise and improving existing structures.But Labour wants to tear everything down and start again, with private schools being top of the list — no doubt because MPs have a vendetta against Etonians.Corbyn also wants to abolish Universal Credit, despite having no tangible plan for its replacement.Universal Credit is the perfect example of where Labour goes wrong. The system has had teething issues but the answer is not to burn it down, it is to make slow improvements.There are other huge, sweeping pledges the party has made, such as nationalising the railways, water, energy and mail, seizing a ten per cent stake in every private company with more than  staff and having a target of net zero for carbon emissions by .Experts have suggested this could lead to meat being rationed, cars confiscated and the wholesale closure of industries .Who cares, though,it gets Labour in charge!Much of the reason Labour has set upon these radical policies is because shaking up the system is always incredibly exciting for the young, particularlyit looks like it might bring about a few freebies.And let’s face it, it is no surprise that millennials and their younger counterparts can be enticed.They have had a rough ride since the  financial crisis, absorbing the shock of the recession and being decades away from home ownership.It is no wonder they think socialism is the answer, especially as it plays into the woke mindset of there being simple, binary solutions to everything.This is why it is so important that young people actually take on what Obama was saying about the world.The Government has to make large numbers of deeply complex decisions, where there cannot always be winners.Almost always someone will lose out in the intricate interplay that is political decision-making.There needs to be more acceptance of a Margaret Thatcher-style realism: That le is not fair.That is something youngsters do not seem to grasp these days, believing equalities can be remedied with the magic wand of socialism.Strong, long-lasting policies do not make sexy soundbites like “For the many”, nor can they be advertised in protests outside Parliament Square.

Are these two really the brightest and the best  Obviously not. But with politics becoming ever more isive and toxic, they are all we have left.Let’s be honest. What normal human being would want to be part of such a cesspit  As we are all well aware, the past three years have seen a constipated parliament unable, or unwilling, to sort out Brexit, forcing us all into a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day.I believe the idea of a European referendum was the height of stupidity by a spooked David Cameron who wanted to neuter Nigel Farage. When the nation voted Leave, Cameron was the first to abandon ship.Never mind “women and children first”. He was rowing away from a Titanic mess in a leboat stuffed with like-minded, snivelling clowns, leaving poor Theresa May behind playing an out-of-tune piano with the rest of the ship’s doomed orchestra. Mrs May foolishly called an election that was a personal disaster, then was worn down until she had to step aside.Boris Johnson thought he could bluster and blag his way to a solution and promised we would exit the EU a couple of days ago, on Halloween. For all his blather about “dying in a ditch”, he couldn’t deliver.So here we are, facing a pre-Christmas election at a time when distrust of politicians has never been higher and our expectations have been never lower. It is easy to dismiss the whole bloody lot of them as a waste of time.But there ARE some decent MPs who want to make a dference. Sadly, some are unwilling to put up with the scrutiny and vilication the job now entails and many are heading out the door.Female MPs, in particular, have been subjected to online abuse that chills the blood. As well as death threats, they have had to deal with vile monsters threatening rape and other violent attacks. It’s horric to have to cope with such hideous abuse on a daily basis. I can’t blame them for quitting in despair.Their fears are real. We saw that with the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox in . She was a we and mother who wanted to make the world a better place and do the best possible job for her constituents. It’s a real pity the MPs now calling it a day are mainly moderates who were calm ­voices of reason amid all the shrieking and howling from extremists on both sides of the political ide.Heidi Allen, a Tory who joined the Lib Dems, can no longer cope with the “nastiness and intimidation” which has become the norm in Parliament. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is leaving because the abuse towards her has had a “clear impact” on her ­family.The Tory and the Labour leaderships should hang their heads in shame at allowing such an appalling situation to develop. They should have called off their attack dogs and clamped down on cowardly online trolls.There have always been robust arguments and passionate debates in politics — but nothing like the sheer hatred and aggression Brexit has unleashed. MPs were used to attacks from opposing parties. But now some of the worst abuse comes from inside.Left-wing extremists threaten deselection for Labour MPs who even whisper about their discontent with Corbyn. Tories find themselves booted out for failing to toe the line. Sadly, the next six weeks will see even more of this aggression as we have to listen to hate-filled rants and ­ludicrous, undeliverable ­promises to secure our votes.It is strange to think that Westminster was respected and admired not so very long ago.

Nor any prospect of Boris Johnson caving to his demands for a pact, destroying the Tories’ unity. And it is patently untrue to say Boris’s deal is not Brexit. The Tory ERG simply wouldn’t back itso.It will end our membership, payments and free movement and extract us from the customs union and single market, with no “backstop” keeping us half-in. We would trade freely as an independent nation. And Boris alone can get us out. The sole alternative as PM is Corbyn, and he will keep us in the EU for ever.In a few constituencies Farage’s party could hurt Labour more than the Tories. Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes. On December , those could put Corbyn in Downing Street in a Remain coalition.At which point Farage’s legacy won’t just be that his vanity wrecked his le’s work.That a party he founded with only one aim, a real Brexit, became the very instrument of the project’s destruction.He will be remembered as the right-wing maverick who handed anti-Semitic, anti-Western Marxists an unprecedented chance to plunder the world’s fth-largest economy. The Sun admires Farage.His pressure brought about the referendum AND a better deal. But he could now be the author of a double national catastrophe.He and his voters should think again.WE’VE heard it all now.Labour’s Tom ­Watson, of all people, insists broadcasters must combat the Tories’ “fake news”.That’s the same Tom Watson who destroyed lives spreading a paedophile’s lies.Whose party’s campaign centres on a blatant fiction about Boris “selling the NHS to Trump”.Whose leader lies endlessly about his terrorist sympathies and anti-Semitism — then sinisterly orders reporters: “Just report what we say.”These charlatans lecture journalists about the truth.But they themselves are strangers to it.Andthey took power, Press freedom would be a nostalgic memory.The Sun joins everyone rooting for Owen and England’s rugby heroes.Best of ruck, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But oddly,  is one of the things that mean the Tories might win that majority this time round. They are determined not to make the same mistakes again. As one senior party figure puts it: “We screwed it up once. We’re not going to do that again.”When Chancellor Sajid Javid spoke to Tory MPs on Wednesday night, he reassured them that “this campaign will not be like last time”. He described Theresa May’s  effort as “the most incompetent election campaign in modern times”.In , the Tories assumed that their chunky poll lead would easily translate into a big majority. There was a complacency and cockiness about their campaign. There was no ­rationale for why Mrs May was going back on her pledge not to have an election and a belief that the Tories could use that lead to win a mandate for almost anything.This time round, the Tories are being much more cautious. The groundwork has been laid for this campaign. Conservative Campaign HQ has been getting election-ready for months. The Tories have heavy-hitters ready to join their ­campaign team, including Paul Stephenson, one of the key ­figures from Vote Leave’s  victory. In , Mrs May took her own party machine by ­surprise with her decision to go to the country.In another dference with the ex-PM, Boris Johnson has a clear argument for why an ­election is needed — the only thing this Parliament is capable of on Brexit is delay. It is hard to see how anyone who wants Brexit and has seen what has happened since the  election could disagree with that.This Tory desire not to screw up will also lead to more ­discipline. This time, the ­manesto will be a cautious document, not an attempt to gain a mandate for a series of deeply unpopular reforms. The fact that everyone knows this election will be close helps the Tories too. There’ll be much more scrutiny of what a Corbyn premiership would mean than there was in .Cabinet Ministers believe that the prospect of a Labour SNP deal which would see Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists help Corbyn into Downing Street in exchange for another independence referendum is already cutting through, and particularly in Scotland, where the Tories are increasingly ­confident they can limit their losses to five seats or fewer.But perhaps the biggest dference from  is between Johnson and May. May had never done a ­national campaign before, she disliked big events and preferred going door to door. Boris, by contrast, is a showman who has already ­successfully fronted one nationwide effort, the  referendum. Boris knows how to make himself the centre of attention in a way Mrs May never did.As one Cabinet minister puts it: “Boris is ­capable of stealing the oxygen from all the other candidates.”The most signicant threat to the Tories is pro-Remain tactical voting. The big question, frets one Cabinet minister, is whether Labour and the Lib Dems end up splitting the ­centre-left vote and letting the Tories win — as happened with Labour and the SDP in  — or whether there is anti-Tory voting that condemns scores of previously safe Tory MPs to defeat — as happened in .Butthe Tories avoid the pitfalls of , then even from a much less promising starting position they should be able to win a majority.THIS election will see the first ever head-to-head televised leaders’ debate between the two big parties. On November , Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will clash in primetime on ITV. Both Labour and the Tories think they will benefit from this one-on-one format.On the Labour side, they hope that it helps them unite the anti-Tory vote behind Corbyn. The Tories think the question of who you want to be Prime Minister – Johnson or Corbyn – favours them.During the  campaign, Theresa May lost her lead on this question. But right now, Boris Johnson has a -point advantage over Corbyn. If he can maintain anything like this margin, he’ll still be in No  come Christmas.Downing Street also thinks that making this election a forced choice between a Tory government and a Labour government works to their benefit. Polling for Conservative Campaign HQ shows that half of voters want the Tories in government in some way, compared to just over a quarter for Labour.They calculate that making the election a choice between Johnson and Corbyn helps them squeeze the Brexit Party vote down – something which is particularly important given Nigel Farage’s determination to put up candidates right across the country.Influential Tories are also worried thatthe Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson turns in a barnstorming performance, her party could threaten the Tories in their shire seats.Johnson himself will not do the seven-way debate between the party leaders. The Tories are keen to downplay the importance of this event. I’m told they are considering sending Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Priti Patel or Rishi Sunak.THE “moratorium” announced on fracking today is a sign of the Tories’ safety-first approach going into this election. They want to close down issues that could cost them seats.One minister defends the decision to abandon the effort to improve the UK’s energy security by saying: “The reality is, it wasn’t happening.”But a bigger factor was their desire not to go into the election with this as a potential vulnerability.I understand that, in stark contrast to , the manesto will be a cautious document designed to prevent handing ammunition to Labour.AT CABINET on Tuesday, Boris Johnson called the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack to speak.An embarrassed Jack explained that he wasn’t actually trying to get in, to which Johnson replied he thought his hand was up.Jack, a multi-millionaire who owns a large farm, then quipped to laughter: “That’s why my farm manager doesn’t let me go to auctions.”THE Tories are planning to accuse Labour of staging a massive raid on the pension pots of million voters.This would hurt the .million who contribute to a private ­pension. Afterwards, one Tory told me Javid’s message was clear: “Labour are coming after your money.”I understand the Tories are also preparing a “tax bombshell” attack on Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Help your school collect , tokens from The Sun and The Sun on Sunday between Saturday, November , , and Saturday, January , . Once your school has , tokens, they will need tothem by Saturday, February , . Your school will receive the books in March “Stories give us knowledge and understanding. They teach us about our place in the world and we learn what happened in the past and how we can do better in the future. All of those lessons come from books. The gt of reading is the greatest enabling thing we can give a child. So, the fact that the Sun is giving children from all kinds of backgrounds more books is incredible.”The best-selling author, , who has written more than  books, remains one of the hardest-working writers around. He says: “I can’t see a time when I’ll ever stop writing.”Although we have more children’s authors than ever before, Michael says we have a problem. There are thousands of kids who  don’t enjoy reading. The former children’s laureate  says: “It could be for any reason. Perhaps there aren’t enough books at home, or the child hasn’t been read to enough.“Or they don’t have access to a decent library.  Or perhaps the adults in their le don’t have enough enthusiasm for books to make it a priority. Whatever the reason, it’s an issue. It takes one book to change everything. Whether it’s a story by Judith Kerr, David Walliams or one of my books, a child engages in a book they will read another one. But the books have to be there in the first place.Michael’s passion for books is obvious and he believes that, in the digital world, many of us have become lazier when it comes to  teaching children. He says: “Technology is overwhelming everything. It is so much easier to give a child an electronic device. Just by pressing a button, they are entertained without any parental or teaching involvement. But reading is about communicating with other people. And being read to by somebody who cares is so important for children.”The former primary school teacher  from Devon   adds: “Children have the right to have a great school library,   great parents and  great teachers. For a child to get lost in a book they must enjoy it. You will only read stories and poems for pleasureyou’re actually enjoying them. The minute you turn stories into comprehension and tests you wreck the whole thing.”Michael realises that boys in particular can struggle to enjoy reading as they get older, as he also stopped enjoying books as a lad. He says: “As a young boy, I loved Enid Blyton’s stories until I was eight and wanted to turn the page. After that age, there were too many school tests and so much pressure to be able to recite poems word-for-word, it took all of the joy out of stories for me. It wasn’t until I was ten and I read Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson, that I was hooked again.”In , Michael was awarded a knighthood for services to literature and charity. He remains a passionate ambassador for children’s books and believes that it is through literature that we can talk about sensitive subjects.He says: “The British have always been incredible storytellers and historically we do it very well. If we are to create literary adults who continue to write incredible stories, we need to create literary children. It’s the only way.”IN our tech-heavy world, it has never been more important to remember the huge part books play in a child’s le, says  Dame Jacqueline Wilson. The  Tracy Beaker author, who is backing The Sun’s Books For Schools campaign,  believes we need to  do everything we can to share the love of books.The former children’s laureate, , says: “Campaigns such as this show people care passionately about the importance of books and children reading. Hopefully, it will resonate with  people and act as a ripple-on-a-pond effect. In this day and age, where it is rare for a school to have its own library and librarian, it is  easy to forget about the part the books can play in a child’s le.“Many children grow up in warm, cosy homes and have lots of lovely outings and the latest devices. Although most parents want their child to read well, it seems as though reading together can sometimes be overlooked and not regarded as important. Even at my age, I can’t stop buying books. I’m not sure I’ll  even have enough time to read all of the books I’ve got.”Jacqueline has written an astonishing  novels, including the Tracy Beaker series which was turned into a popular television series for CBBC. She has never been one to shy away from writing about tough subjects such as adoption, orce and mental illness. She says: “I’m very  evangelical about the importance of sharing books with children so that they can learn that stories equal joy from a young age.“If we can encourage that love of books  when young, that will hopefully follow a child for their whole le. The love of stories often  comes after you’ve learnt the mechanics of how to read. That’s when you can become totally absorbed in a story.  Just ten minutes a day of reading a book to a child can make such a huge dference.“Even as a child becomes older, and can read themselves, it’s still great to share books together. I think it’s wonderful when unlikely people such as sportsmen, actresses and musicians talk about how much they love reading and write books. They have a particular power to be able to connect with children who might not relate to nerdy writers like me.“As a child, I adored What Katy Did, and Ballet Shoes by Noel Streatfeild.  I totally immersed myself in that world. I imagined I was going to stage school and my bedroom slippers were ballet shoes.” All I ever wanted to do was write stories and I wrote my first ‘novel’ when I was nine. To this day, books are still my passion.“We talk about the huge benefits for children when reading a story, but it’s such a treat for an adult to read to a child. I know that some parents are shy about reading aloud, but they don’t need to be. Children don’t mindwords are fluffed or mispronounced. Some children  struggle to sit still and listen to a story, which can make it become a chore.“However, parents need to allow the child to do what they need to do in order to be comfortable. They don’t need to sit still, quiet as a mouse, and listen. If they’re happy playing with their Lego or colouring, then let them do that and just read to them. It’s similar to an adult listening to the radio or a podcast. For some children, listening like that is much more enjoyable. Reading for pleasure is truly wonderful, it would be a very sad day indeedwe stopped.”For more information, pick up The Sun.Later this month we’ll start printing tokens in the paper for schools and parents to collect.Once they reach the target, we’ll send out a bumper pack of  Collins Big Cat books, suitable for kids in Reception and Year .Schools can register at thesun booksforschoolsEVERYBODY should have access to books because they help you achieve your dreams, says author Holly Smale. The writer of the hit Geek Girl novel series for teens is backing The Sun’s Books For Schools campaign. Holly, , admits she was obsessed with books from early childhood and where other kids had a favourite teddy, Holly would clutch her copy of Enid Blyton’s The Faraway Tree and take it wherever she went.Holly, from Hertfordshire, says: “Ever since I was a small child I knew I wanted to write stories and I pursued the dream relentlessly. I wouldn’t have achieved my le’s ambitionI wasn’t able to read as often as I wanted to.”As a little girl, Holly was taken to the library with her sister every week. She says: “We didn’t have any money for books and I read so many that my mum couldn’t keep up with me. We went to the library every Saturday and I would take the maximum amount of books, I think it was ten, every single time. My library card felt as though it was a special key which meant I could access anything.“My poor mum would stagger home under the weight of all our books then we’d be back again the following weekend. My little sister was very loyal to one particular book and borrowed Dogger by Shirley Hughes every week. My parents accepted my obsession with reading and the fact I’d hold a book with one hand while eating with the other. By the time I started school I could read and was lucky that there was a whole new selection of books for me. I still use libraries to this day.”School was tricky for Holly. She was badly bullied but was able to channel the experience into Harriet Manners, the heroine of her award-winning young adult novels. She says: “Books have always been there for me through good times and bad times. On a bad day at school, I’d hide in my bedroom and read Anne Of Green Gables. Every book you read becomes a part of you.”There are depressing statistics about the drop in children reading for pleasure, but Holly believes it’s about finding the right story. She says: When I was a girl, Netflix and YouTube didn’t exist. On long, boring days, it was natural to lose yourself in a book, but nowadays youngsters have more choice on how to spend their time.“Sadly, I don’t have time to read ten books a week any more but I usually have two on the go. There are times when I need to turn the telly off or come back earlier from the pub to finish a book. But losing myself in a great story reminds me I’m doing what I love . . . I’ve got the le I wanted as a kid.”IT’S simple to start.

The about face came after research from the Oil and Gas Authorityraised concerns over the ability to predict fracking-linked earthquakes.Jeremy Corbyn branded the move in the run-up to the December  poll an election stunt, and pledged Labour would go further by actually ending fracking. Speaking to reporters in Swindon, Mr Corbyn said: I think it sounds like fracking would come back on the th of December,they were elected back into office.Weaposre quite clear, we will end fracking. We think itaposs unnecessary, we think itaposs pollutive of ground water systems, and also all the evidence from Preston New Road in Lancashire is itaposs actually dangerous and has caused serious earth tremors.    He added: It seems to me like an election stunt and I think itaposs whataposs called euphemistically a bit of greenwash.The suspension is a reversal of years of support from the Tories, including from Boris Johnson who has consistently praised shale gas extraction and hit out at its opponents.Shadow housing secretary John Healey welcomed the move but noted that the Conservatives are playing catch-up now with Labouraposs opposition to the process, which was to feature prominently in the campaign. Speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, the Labour MP warned: This appears to be temporary.  This may not be a real reprieve. Youaposve got to remember that Boris Johnson once said he wanted to leave no stone unturned and no stone unfracked, so this I fear could be a gambit at the start of the election and we may see that he does something dferent to what he says now.The Liberal Democrats raised similar fears, with former energy secretary Sir Ed Davey calling for an immediate ban now.But this belated, eve of election policy pause wonapost distract voters from the Toriesapos shocking record on the environment - not least the Prime Ministeraposs, when he lobbied to relax air pollution laws, he said.    The Government said on Friday that it would end its support for the process, which has provoked particular outrage in counties such as Lancashire and Yorkshire. Ms Leadsom defended the suspension despite praising the advantages of the process which she hailed as a huge opportunity. So, yes, itaposs a disappointment but weaposve always been clear that we will follow the science, she told Today. But she was clear that the moratorium was only in place until the science changes. Pressed on why a permanent ban is not being imposed, she replied: Because this is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom. We will follow the science and it is quite clear that we canapost be certain. The science isnapost accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate so therefore unless and until we can be absolutely certain we are imposing a moratorium.

The appeal seeks a special commemoration of serving personnel and former personnel who “lost their lives in defence of the nation as surely as those who died on the battlefield.” It is backed by three ex-Services chiefs and former England football captain Terry Butcher, whose soldier son Christopher died following a struggle with PTSD. The campaign is calling for the names of all those who took their own lives to be added to the Armed Forces memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire. Around  serving and former personnnel have committed suicide since the beginning of . At least  troops have died this year, a  per cent rise on this stage of .    Former Ipswich and Rangers star Terry, now , said his son and hundreds of others like him were also victims of war. Christopher, a Royal Artillery captain, had been haunted by nightmares and flashbacks about Afghanistan. The -year-old had been diagnosed with severe PTSD and medically discharged from the Army. Dad Terry said: “Those soldiers’ names should be on the wall as they were also victims of war along with those already engraved. “Their deaths were a direct result of the conflict and the total lack of medical help and assistance afterwards.” The campaign is led by Jo Jukes, whose Iraq War veteran husband Dave killed himself last year after suffering from PTSD for more than a decade.  Jo, , a Birmingham mum of two, said: “We need a memorial to show that veterans who took their own lives after being diagnosed with service-attributable mental health conditions died because they served their country. “They may not have died on the battlefield but the mental wounds they received in fighting for this country in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Northern Ireland are just as real.” The plea is also supported by General the Lord Dannatt and General Sir Mike Jackson, both former heads of the Army, and ex-Navy chief Lord West of Spithead.  Lord Dannatt said: “It’s a very sad reality that those who have taken their own lives as a result of losing their personal battles with PTSD, are as much the fatalities of war as those who have lost their lives in combat.” General Jackson said: “I whole-heartedly support the proposal for a suitable memorial.” Lord West added: “It is appropriate that their sacrice is commemorated and I can think of no better place than the National Arboretum.” "},{"url":null,"title":"con artists use ed sheeran","story":"NewsCon artists use Ed Sheeran and Harry Potter in fake university swindleThe singer and boy wizard were highlighted in publicity for the bogus College of Suffolk, as Ed lives in the county and Harry was born thereShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  NOV NewsEd Sheeran and Harry Potter were highlighted in publicity for the bogus College of Suffolk\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family of six say they are aposliving a daily nightmareapos, forced to stay in one filthy room of a shared house. Craig Simmonds and Roxanne Stamford, who have one disabled child and a young baby, are bringing up their family in the tiny room - which had blood stains on the bedding and mice droppings on the carpet. The couple told to Bristol Live they had to threaten Bristol City Council with an emergency court injunction just to get a room for the night. The family said they have fallen into the gaps, with two local authorities - Bristol and Cornwall Council - both attempting to deny they are responsible for housing them. Over the last few months, they say they have been moved around constantly, from a caravan in Cornwall to hotels and temporary accommodation until they ended up in a House of Multiple Occupancy in Southville, Bristol. Craig and Roxanne arrived at the room in Southville in the middle of October, after four days in an emergency tourist holiday let AirBnB in the city centre. They found the accommodation had a double bed and a bunk bed.The bedding was blood-stained, the room and the tiny en-suite shower-room was filthy, with mouse droppings evident and a dirty carpet, toilet and cooking area. The next day, after sending images of the state of the place to Bristol City Council, an emergency ‘deep clean’ was arranged.    And there, the family of six have remained, waiting in limbo while two local authorities  miles apart argue the other is responsible for housing them. The couple’s ordeal began last year when Roxanne suffered from serious post-natal depression and other mental health issues following the birth of her youngest child, Aimee. Roxanne and Craig lived in Cornwall, where Craig worked long hours as a chef.Roxanne’s illness meant he kept having to take time off work to care for her and his children, and so he lost his job, and the couple fell into rent arrears on their council house in Camborne. They were eventually evicted by Cornwall Council on May  this year, and have not had a permanent home since. Craig is born and bred in Bristol.When he was nine, escaping an abusive relationship, his mum moved the family to Cornwall, where he then lived. He grew up, met Roxanne, started a family and his mum Lou was a huge help as the couple - at that point - had three children, Catelynn, Freddie and Harry. Freddie, particularly, needed more help - he has a range of special needs, including cerebral palsy, and has to have his legs rubbed vigorously after any exercise. But three years ago, Lou ‘retired’ back to her native South Bristol, moving into an over-s flat in Stockwood, and when Aimee arrived last year, Craig and Roxanne struggled on their own. So when they were evicted by Cornwall Council on May , the couple didn’t know where  to go, but to put all their belongings into a family member’s car, and drive up the M to Bristol. “I didn’t want the kids to see the bailfs actually come and chuck us out, I couldn’t bear that to happen,” said Roxanne, who is pregnant. “So I left the keys with a neighbour and we left the day before, on April , before the bailfs came.” They squeezed in to Lou’s flat for a couple of nights, and presented themselves at  Temple Street, Bristol City Council’s housing department headquarters.   The couple were put into a three-bed house, albeit temporarily, in Bedminster.The three older children were enrolled into their local primary school and as a skilled chef, Craig got a job quickly at a local pub. “Everything was sorted, or seemed to be,” said Craig. “The school was amazing, the kids settled in really well, they loved going to school, and I got a job. The house was nice, and I thought we would be ok.” But behind the scenes, it appears a conflict was brewing between Bristol City Council and Cornwall Council. As the family went through the process of applying for more permanent housing, they were told there was a problem. Craig’s ‘local links’ didn’t meet the criteria. He hadn’t been an adult in Bristol. He and his family hadn’t lived in Bristol for more than six months.  His family link to his mum didn’t count either - any family member has to have lived in Bristol for five years for that to count, and Lou only moved back to the city three years ago. Bristol is a city still in the grips of a housing crisis, despite new homes being built in their hundreds.There are , people on the housing waiting list, and  families in temporary accommodation. As the summer began, the family were told they would have to go back to Cornwall, and present themselves as homeless there, not in Bristol. It was Harry’s sixth birthday, the day the children were taken out of Parson Street School and driven back down the M to be put into a single room in a shared house in Newquay. “It was awful. At am there were people drunk or on drugs, banging on the door, shouting they were going to kill us. The children were terried,” said Craig.    Cornwall Council kept moving them around places like that, including for a spell, into a caravan.By mid-August, the new school year was looming and Roxanne was desperate to provide some stability for her children. “Trying to get the kids into school was an absolute nightmare. Cornwall Council told us they would have to go to school, but allocated the three of them three dferent schools, which was just impossible,” said Craig. Then, Craig said Cornwall Council told them their efforts to find them a home had failed, and hit them with another bombshell. “They told us we had made ourselves intentionally homeless, because we left the day before the bailfs came,” Roxanne said, as she fought back the tears. “They told us that there was nothing more they could do, and we would have to find our own privately rented accommodation, and pay for it with our housing benefit. “I spent weeks searching for somewhere to live. It was impossible. We didn’t have a guarantor.There is absolutely nowhere in Cornwall that will take a family of six on benefits in private rented accommodation,” she said.    The day came - October  - when Cornwall Council’s temporary accommodation ended, and the family were out on the streets again.For the second time, they made the trip back up the M.On Monday, October , they presented themselves again at  Temple Street, and were told that,  Bristol City Council had no duty to house them, they were Cornwall’s problem. In desperation the kids about to leave school and with nowhere to stay that night, they went to the offices of homeless charity Shelter. Shocked officials there immediately summoned their legal department, and a stf request threatening an emergency court appeal meant that Bristol City Council’s housing staff accepted that they could not, after all, leave a family of six, with four children under the age of eight, including a baby, on the streets. A housing officer used a corporate credit card to book an AirBnB.    They were told they would be staying three nights, and again on Thursday morning, were waiting at the council offices to be told where to go next. Finding them a place to live appears to have been handed over to Connolly  Callaghan, which runs a huge number of temporary accommodation units in Bristol. CC initially told them to go to a two-bed flat in Fishponds, but then told them it was flooded. After telling CC that their children’s school was in Bedminster, they were sent to a room in an HMO in Southville. “We arrived and the front door was open, the door to the room was open and we were told this was it,” said Roxanne. “There was blood stains on the bed. The kids walked in and sat down on the floor and I looked at the floor and it was filthy,” she added. “The state of the little bathroom was worse - one of my kids looked at it and refused to go in it - we go to Asda when he needs the loo.” The family have applied to be accepted onto the waiting list in Bristol.

Caleb-Amie Soltendieck, from Quebec in Canada, raced down to the beach after watching the vehicle fall  feet. He found the caravan partly submerged in water on top of Ms Ferrari’s body, which he managed to pull clear from the wreckage. Despite his attempts to resuscitate her it was immediately clear to Mr Soltendieck that she was dead, an inquest in Galway heard. Garda Shane Nally said the caravan was searched to checkanyone  was in it and that the body of Ms Ferrari was taken to University Hospital Galway for a post mortem. Her belongings, including a bicycle helmet, were scattered on the beach in the aftermath of the tragedy.    Although strong winds were predicted that day, the sheer strength of Storm Ali had taken those at the Eco Beach Camping and Caravanning Park in Connemara by surprise. The siteaposs owners Kris and Tatjama Acton had offered Ms Ferrari use of a mobile home in a more sheltered location night before the storm, which she had turned down.Coast Guard officer Michael Murray, who lives close to the camp site, said weather forecasters had underestimated the strength of the storm.He said: “The forecast was well off. It was near hurricane force, a severe storm.” Mr Murray added that he had to move his Toyota Landcruiser jeep, which he had parked close to where the caravan had been positioned, because it was being moved by the wind. Coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin said the death was a tragic accident.    “There is no way this could have been foreseen, a storm of that nature is most unusual at that time of year, he told the court. The coroner said the wind swept the caravan away as Ms Ferrari tried to get out and that it came down on top of her on the beach, causing fatal injuries. Pathologist Dr Ramada Shatwan said that the cause of death was a severe traumatic head injury which led to a fractured skull and crushed brain tissue. He said there were no other fractured bones and that all organs were normal. Ms Ferrari lived in Steinmaur, a municipality north of Zurich, where she studied Alzheimeraposs disease.

Nine years after the photoshoot, the Queen sat down with her dressmaker and close friend Angela Kelly to discuss how they could make things right.    Writing in her new book The Other Side of the Coin, Angela explains what actually happened. She claims that the Queen was due to just meet Annie and her daughter, but when she arrived there were more than  people in the room. She simply didnapost have time to speak to them all, so left to go to the photo shoot as had always been the plan.    Angela writes: One of the good things about working in the same job for such a long time is that it allows you to put things right that havenapost quite gone as planned in the past. I have always felt so bad for Annie about how this was late reported, as she really didnapost deserve to be misrepresented in this way. So Angela suggested that the Queen ask Annie to take the official photos for her th birthday - and the Monarch loved the idea. The Queen was more than happy and in full agreement that it would be the right thing to do to make amends for the earlier misunderstanding, and she said yes. After they had discussed what they wanted from the official photos, Angela travelled to New York to personally ask Annieshe would take the pictures. When I told her that the Queen had asked for her toto photograph her on or close to her ninetieth birthday, Annie was thrilled and humbled to receive such an honour. Annie and her team flew to the UK over the Easter weekend to take the photos while the Royal Family were all together for the holiday. They took four photos which were shared around the world to mark the landmark birthday - with one of her with her great-grandchildren, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte, getting all of the attention.    There was also a photo of the Queen with her daughter Princess Anne, one of her with Prince Philip and another of her dressed down outside with her beloved corgis. Angela writes: The great-grandchildren were all so well behaved, and I think even they were excited about having a group photograph taken with the Queen. But th real stars of the show that day were the corgis. They knew how to work the camera, looking straight at Annie while she was taking the photos. The Queen was delighted with the pictures, which were very special family photos to be shared with the public.    Speaking about the incident back in , Annie said: The morning of the shoot the Queen came walking down the hall very purposely. She was definitely in force. This is all being taped by the BBC for a documentary. I would never have agreed to them being thereI felt I had any choice. But they had been following her around for months. There microphone picked up her saying: aposIaposve had enough of dressing like this thank you very muchapos, as she marched down the hall.    It appeared the Queen was stomping out of the photo session, rather than going into it, the photographer added. Leibovitz said the Queen was  minutes late as she had to get into the complicated ceremonial outfit for the pictures. Once the Queen was in position Leibovitz asked to take off her crown. She said: I asked hershe would remove the tiara, I said it looked a little dressy.

Nicola Ward says she would catastrophise about ious situations that could happen to her while she was in her car.  The -year-old said she would feel like Iaposm in turmoil when in the car and that driving would leave her feeling absolutely exhausted.  The small business owner from Reading noticed her driving anxiety started when she moved out of London and away from city le to the suburbs, to start a family. She drives on a daily basis but since the birth of her daughter, Sydney, her anxiety in the car has signicantly increased and says sheaposs always ‘on high alert’ whilst driving. Nicola admits she does not trust other motorists to follow the highway code and panics when she gets stuck in traffic.  She told Mirror: I need my car on a daily basis to get to work and for childcare so itaposs not something I can stop doing. I always feel most vulnerable when my baby is in the car. Things got worse after I had a collision in Spring  when someone drove into me. After that I was extremely jumpy in the car. I started noticing and envisioning things happening and I would catastrophise situations. I would look in my rear view mirror and was certain that someone would drive into the back of me.   Iaposd have extreme thoughts like I would be driving under a bridge and I would be terried it would collapse. If I was stuck in traffic I would be extremely worried that Iaposd never get out of the jam and would plan my escape route. I was feeling constantly on edge while driving. I was unsettled and could never relax. I just wanted to get to where I was going.    Nicola shared her experience as it was revealed nearly a third of UK drivers have suffered a near miss on the roads due to feelings of anxiety, according to new research commissioned by ST CENTRAL Insurance and leading mental health charity, SANE. As many as  of us have experienced anxiety while driving, putting themselves and other drivers at risk. The research forms part of a new joint campaign launched earlier this month dedicated to raising awareness of anxiety and the threat it presents on our roads. SANE has also developed a suite of practical advice to address this problem, by helping motorists tackle feelings of anxiety. To help address this issue and improve driver safety, ST CENTRAL has partnered with SANE to provide advice for how drivers might tackle feelings of anxiousness both before and during driving: .     Before the journey ask yourself: are you safe to drive  Consider whether it’s worth taking the journey at all. If you must travel, could you take public transport instead, or call a taxi  .     Pull over and stop at the earliest and safest opportunity. If you begin to feel anxious while driving, breathing exercises and meditation techniques can help ease the feelings of anxiety once safely stopped. .     Be mindful of noise. Don’t be afraid to ask passengers to keep the noise down. If you listen to music, consider opting for songs with a lower tempo, or music you find calming. .     Think about your environment. Keeping the car clean and tidy could help create a calm atmosphere. You could consider putting lavender, which can be soothing, in their car to create a relaxed atmosphere. .     If you’re a passenger, and you feel unsafe due to a driver that appears to be feeling anxious, consider gently suggesting stopping for a toilet break or for a soft drink. De-escalation is important, because getting into an argument with the driver could make the situation worse."},{"url":null,"title":"i took pride britain winner","story":"NewsopinionI took Pride of Britain winner Adventureman to Downing Street to speak to PMPride Of Britain Award winners, including a former robber and a real-le superhero, spoke to Boris Johnson inside No.  about how they will use their trophies as “tangible symbols” of the qualities that make a nation proudShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  NOV Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video liam-payne-surprises-pride-britain-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news i-took-pride-britain-winner-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

They’re dangerous and misleading. I wish I could tell you to rip ’em up without looking at them, but occasionally there’s ­practical info you need. Over million uni leavers still have outstanding loans, and many panic on seeing £s in interest added each month – a ­financial canker that’s led some into making catastrophic decisions. No surprise that one of the most common questions I’m asked by those with a little spare cash is: “Should I be trying to clear my student loan ”For detailed help see mse.me studentoverpay , but in brief…Which student loan plan do you have  There are three main types.Plan : All from England or Wales who started university in or after , including current students. Plan : All who started university between  and , and Scottish and Northern Irish students since. Mortgage-style loans: All those who started between  and . Plan  loans: These are the ­scariest as the debt can be up to £,.The interest is high, too. It changes ­annually with inflation, but for this academic year .% is added while at university then .%-.%, depending on income, when you leave. Yet while this is what statements show, for most these numbers are irrelevant as what you oweISN’T what you pay back. What you repay each year depends solely on what you earn.    You repay % of earnings over £, . Earn less and you pay nowt. In effect it’s like a % additional tax, because your annual repayments stay the same whether you owe £, or £ million. The prime dference the amount owed makes is whether you’ll clear the loan or not within the  years before it wipes.  It’s estimated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that % WON’T. Of course those who never earn over the threshold won’t repay owt at all. Those who earn just above it will repay some of their original loan but no interest. Mid- earners may pay the loan and some interest, but less than inflation, so there’s no “real cost”. Mid-to-high-earners may pay real interest, but still not everything on the statement. So for all those groups, the interest you see added to your statement is NOT the interest you pay. The only people for whom statements tell the truth is that top % of earners who’ll clear within the  years.  Tragically, the pressure of seeing that oft-irrelevant interest build-up pushes people to make mistakes. One woman told me she’d used an inheritance of a few thousand to overpay her student loan to “reduce the interest”. Yet she was a low earner, so that overpayment’s unlikely to reduce what she’ll pay in future by even a penny. It’s money flushed down the loo, as you can’t get back what you voluntarily overpay. Therefore those with spare cash should use it first to clear other expensive debt. After that, save it to reduce the need for future borrowing.I’d suggest building up a mortgage deposit – a far better use of the cash mse.me LetimeISAs .After all, with other debts they still chase youyou lose your job, but with student loans lower income means you don’t repay. Only those who’ll be consistently high earners over the  years, and won’t need to borrow anywhere , can truly say, “The interest is higher than I can earn saving, so I’ll pay it off”.

Just months ago, Haley Myles feared she wouldn’t live to see -month-old Ava bloom into a young woman. Haley, , had already defied the odds to give birth after an op left her with just a quarter of a womb. Then, in February, her world fell apart when medics diagnosed her with stage four cervical cancer. They had run out of treatment options. Incredibly Haley is now in remission after your donations helped fund a course of miracle drugs.  Emotional Haley said: “I went for a scan and the doctor said ‘We can’t see any signs of cancer anywhere’. “It was surreal, I was in so much shock I didn’t cry. I just ran outside and gave my mum a huge hug. “I can’t thank Sunday People readers and everyone who donated enough. Their generosity has bought me a future with Ava. I just can’t put a price on that.” The Sunday People’s ­appeal saw readers help to raise £,, so Haley could have pioneering immunotherapy.   The procedure trains the ­immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells. But research is at an early stage, so the drugs are not ­available to most on the NHS. Last month, Haley was given the news she and partner Ryan McShane, , had been waiting for. Haley, from Carluke, South Lanarkshire, said: “My family tried not to show their emotions, but Dad cried when I told him the cancer had gone. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen him cry before.” Pharmacist Haley always longed to be a mum but struggled to conceive after being diagnosed with endometriosis, a uterus disorder. In excruciating pain, she made the decision to have a ­hysterectomy in February , resigned to never ­conceiving naturally.  But surgeons were unable to remove her whole womb and, five months later, she was stunned to learn she was ­pregnant with Ava. “Ava was my first medical ­miracle. Now I’ve had a ­second,” Haley said. She had several abnormal smear tests and was being checked every six months before her hysterectomy. But after ­giving birth in March last year, she stopped getting reminders – and now suspects they were sent to her old address. Haley started bleeding heavily when Ava was  weeks old and initially thought it was because of the birth. But the symptoms ­continued and she went for a smear test last June.  It came back clear but her ­instincts screamed at her that something was still badly wrong. She paid for a private scan last September, when doctors broke the devastating news. Haley said: “It was a total shock to hear the word cancer. I phoned Ryan and burst out crying.” She was told radiotherapy was too much of a risk, as her womb op had left vital organs exposed. Instead, she had six rounds of chemo – but was left shattered in February, when she was told it had failed. Medics broke the news that Haley’s cancer was at stage four and had spread to her bowel, and there was nothing more they could do.  She said: “When you hear the words stage , you think, ‘I’m not going to be here, that’s it’. I asked the doctors, ‘What  is ­available ’ They told me I could try immunotherapy but couldn’t get it on the NHS. “That night, I was in so much shock I went to a birthday party and had a gin like nothing had happened. “The tears came after. “I thought about Ava, and how much that she needed me. “I couldn’t bear the thought of missing her first day at school.” On average only a fth of patients with stage four cervical cancer live more than five years. But reading about pioneering immunotherapy gave Haley hope. A University College London trial found a quarter of women either went into complete remission or had ­tumours shrink signicantly after. The only stumbling block was the cost, as Haley discovered it came with a price tag of up to £,.

Kimberley Davison, , works all of the hours she can in a bid to support her family but is still struggling to make ends meet.The constant budgeting and stress is now taking its toll on her mental health, the mum told Chronicle Live.It’s like a fight to survive every month, she said. “I work all of the hours I can and do everything possible to support my family, but it’s still not enough.” The nurse, from Hebburn near Gateshead, does not work during the work, instead picking up shts on weekends when she can. But even this source of work is unreliable with Kimberley working on a zero hour contract.    The mum-of-one says she cannot afford any extra childcare, mainly because she lost her mum and stepdad to cancer while she was a student. She said: “It’s dficult to work during the week as I can only work half days and hospitals don’t really want those shts.” Childcare is available through the Government, but Kimberley claims this would still not allow her to work a full -hour sht as the childcare is only offered between am and pm. Kimberley takes on weekend shts when her son is with his dad, but this earns her on average £ a month. This is not including the the £ a week in Child Tax Credit she receives. Each month her outgoings include £ rent, £ council tax and £ for gas and electricity. She also pays for her Royal College of Nursing union membership, TV licence, phone and credit card payments.    The mum then has to fork out £ for school meals and £ for travel to and from work, leaving her with £ a week to feed her family.  In the past, Kimberly has had to use food banks after surviving a full weekend without sufficient food. “I especially struggle during the six weeks school holiday, it’s horrendous, she said.

The booze ladened breakfast was just one of the ways Melissa Rice used alcohol when she was in the grips of her addiciton. Now a co-host of BBC  Live podcast Hooked: The Unexpected Addicts along with Jade Wye, Melissa speaks candidly about how her le revolved around alcohol. She had her first hard drink when she was a teenager and began to use alcohol as a way to cope with anxiety while studying at university.    My drinking was getting worse because the way I was feeling internally and emotionally was getting worse, Melissa explained on the podcastaposs second episode, The Rock Bottom. My le was getting more and more chaotic. I was losing friends, respect, self-respect, because I was consistently lying. I was letting people down and it didnapost matter what anybody could pull me up on, it was nowhere near as bad as the way I used to talk to myself about it... Melissa found herself in a spiral. The worse her le seemed to her, the more she drank. The more she drank, the more her le fell apart. In a bid to fool her loved ones Melissa would hide bottles of vodka in her local park. I had signals in the park where Iaposd hidden vodka in empty bottles, she said.    Because when I was allowed out for a brief walk, I wasnapost allowed to take a phone, bank cards. I knew the consequences but there was no choice. I had to have a drink. Another way she concocted of consuming alcohol was to pour whiskey onto her cereal in the morning. I had Jack Daniels on my cereal. It was bad, she said. In August  Melissa realised she had reached rock bottom and knew she had to stop. Her body was so accustomed to dealing with large amounts of alcohol, she had to wean herself or  risk seriously harming herself by going cold turkey.    That night, every couple of hours, I was allowed a shot of vodka, Melissa said. The final drink was at am. The most heart-wrenching thing about it was that my mum had to pour it. How selfless that is for my own mum to have to give her own daughter a drink, not because she wanted to, but becauseshe didnapost, she could die  That was rock bottom. On her podcast Melissa joins Jade in interviewing guests who are willing to share their experiences with addiciton. The third episode featured Richard Bacon who admitted he may still be addicted to alcohol, and that heavy drinking has caused chaos and dficulty and uncertainty in his le.

A total of  Network Rail projects are taking place between late December and early January, heralding one of Britain’s “worst ever Christmases”. And in a further blow yesterday, a major union proposed a series of strikes. Routes to be hit connect London to the South-West, East, Midlands, Wales, Glasgow and Edinburgh. All trains are axed between the capital and Reading from December  to , with half scrapped December -.  Buses replace trains between Bristol and Cardf from December  to January , making a London-Cardf journey two hours longer than usual. Some journeys on the London to Glasgow West Coast mainline will take  minutes longer as buses replace trains from Carlisle north. London to Edinburgh services are reduced on December . Adding to the problems, Heathrow and Gatwick Express services will be shut down or have services halved.  The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, says engineering works are commonplace over the festive season as many passengers are away. But campaigners TravelWatch warned: “Many Christmas rail users may be inexperienced travellers and travelling with children, and these people suffer the most during disruption. “We expect Network Rail and operators to ensure work is done within advertised timescales, with contingency plans for unforeseen problems.”  Bruce Williamson of industry campaign group Railfuture said: “It’s impossible to do work without inconveniencing passengers. The railways have suffered decades of underinvestment so we’re now playing catch-up.” Rail union boss Manuel Cortes of the TSSA said: “No one likes to be inconvenienced. But to keep trains running safely we need to ensure tracks and signalling are properly maintained.” "},{"url":null,"title":"starving dog who seen worst","story":"NewsStarving dog who has seen the worst of humanity hurled from car over gateWARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT.

Plymouth in Devon was also rocked by mph winds. Matt Box, a Met Office meteorologist, said: Theyare being caused by low pressure that has moved in from the west. The strongest winds are found wrapped around the south western flank.    Theyaposre affecting the south west, parts of west Wales and the south coast, and will continue into the afternoon.

Personally I remember one New Years when my parents lit a firework in the garden, at our family home in Cornwall, he said. The firework went horizontal. They can be affected by strong winds.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has told of the moment she desperately tried to buckle her seatbelt as the vehicle she was travelling in spun out of control at mph. Ashley Waldram, , has been left with huge scars across her arm and torso after she became trapped in the all-terrain vehicle when it went over a ledge on January , . As Ashley then tried to buckle herself in, a dangerous turn caused the vehicle to roll over. The driver of the car, Ashleyaposs uncle, Jr, , was thrown from the vehicle in the terrying crash, but Ashley remained completely trapped inside the framework until it stopped rolling. Shortly after, Ashley was found with her head wedged between the seat and the external frame.Shocked bystanders, who had seen the crash unfold, rushed to pull Ashley from the wreckage and drove her back to the road where they waited for an ambulance.When paramedics arrived, they realised the extent of Ashleyaposs injuries meant she needed to be flown to a nearby hospital. Before flying, Ashleyaposs lung needed to be manually inflated after it was punctured in the crash.Once at the hospital , doctors discovered just how many injuries Ashley had sustained.   She spent the first  hours on ventilation, being monitored closely by doctors. Ashley had skull fractures, brain bleeds, a broken right humerus, collapsed lung, a grade four liver laceration, six broken ribs on her right side and an unknown amount on her left. The impact severely damaged her liver and the internal bleeding almost killed her, and she was placed on a ventilator for three days. Three days later, on February , Ashley needed surgery to insert titanium plates in her ribcage to stabilise her ribs, leaving an enormous scar across her torso.    The journey to recovery was long and dficult, with Ashley admitting she often found herself crying because of how helpless she felt. She was unable to wash or feed herself, and breathing was dficult too. Now, with over three years of physiotherapy behind her, Ashley wears her scars with pride and encourages others to remain hopeful through whatever theyaposre facing. In January , my uncle and I took the ATV out to the sand dunes outside Carlsbad in New Mexico, said Ashley. I remember trying to buckle in while we were racing fast down the stretch. We made a turn, went over a ledge and I donapost remember anything until we stopped rolling.    My uncle was ejected immediately, and he wasnapost buckled in either, but I tossed around inside. When it stopped moving, I was found unresponsive with my head between the seat and the side rail. My uncle was conscious and called for help. Luckily there were two bystanders who witnessed it and immediately came to our aid. They put me in their ATV and helped us get to the main road to wait for the ambulance. I remember that hard landing and then I remember sitting in someoneaposs ATV waiting for the ambulance. I kept pulling my knees to my chest. I donapost remember anything  until the day after I was off the ventilator. Before I could fly, they had to manually re-inflate my lung. Once I got to the hospital, I had a chest tube placed, multiple blood transfusions and I was placed on a ventilator for three days.  I had minor skull fractures including my maxillofacial bone in my cheek, minor brain bleeds, my right humerus was broken and later repaired with a metal plate, I had a grade four liver laceration that they treated with multiple blood transfusions, grade two kidney lacerations, six broken ribs on my right side, and an unknown amount on the left. I also had a minor chest burn and a deviated septum. When I woke up, I remember askingmy younger cousins had seen anything and I was really worried about them. The pain wasnapost too bad due to all the pain medication, but a few days later I had surgery to repair my arm and four ribs and the pain was unbearable after surgery. Initially, doctors werenapost sureI would make a full recovery, but after I made it through the first  hours the chances got higher. Amazingly, Ashleyaposs uncle came away from the wreckage with only a few scrapes to his hands and knees. For six months after the accident, Ashley had to be cautious and take care of her fragile body until sheaposd healed.  Later, in July  she had another surgery to straighten her septum which had made it very dficult for her to breathe for more than a year. Recovery was very long, physically and mentally. There were days when I would sit in the bathroom and just cry because I couldnapost bathe myself, feed myself, and it hurt to breathe. It was very overwhelming at times, Ashley said. I came out of hospital on February  and then I did a lot of physical therapy to get the use in my arm back over the years following surgery.I still face effects from the crash to this day. Physically, my lung capacity has decreased quite a bit and my arm and ribs ache a lot in the cold weather . Mentally, I struggle with PTSD when I think about it."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db97190652f23.70248995.jpg ","title":"dee boss mcpake lauds outstanding graham dorrans","story":"Dundee boss James McPake says the -

defeat at Queen of the South with Jamie Robson, Peter Pawlett and Clark coming in for Paul Watson, Sam Stanton and Louis Appere.Unbeaten in their last four, Dunfermline only showed one dference to their starting XI with Andy Ryan coming in for Kevin Nisbet for the Tannadice clash.And it was United who started strongest as they took the lead on nine minutes.Liam Smith#s initial delivery from the right caused Cammy Gill in the Pars goal to flap at the ball and when Clark launched it back into the box, Shankland made no mistake from six yards out to net his th United goal of the season.Two minutes later Dunfermline threatened to net a quick equaliser but Benjamin Siegrist in the home goal was a match for Ryan#s header.

That’s what we looked to do on Saturday because we knew we had a tough week ahead. It was good to go and get the victory to start the week positively.“It’ll definitely be a tough test.

Obviously the home form is a positive because you need to win as many home games as you can but we’re not going to get carried away and feel like we need to beat everybody.“We just need to turn up and do our jobs week-in, week-out and make sure that we’re performing at our best when we’re at home. vw, px\"  “If we do that, we’ll get results.“We had two disappointing results in the last two games away from home and it’s something that happens in this league.“You see teams dropping points all over the place so it is like that.“If we keep our home form good, though, and win most of our games then we can maybe afford to drop a couple away.“Obviously, we’ll look to go up to Inverness on a real grass pitch as well, which helps, and put on a performance there. But we have a big test tonight first.”Nicky Clark got the second goal against Dunfermline on Saturday after teeing up Shankland, leading the hitman to praise his colleague.“It was good to get back on the scoresheet with a tap in and I was delighted to see Clarky get his first goal and get off the mark as well.“Earlier in the season we had glimpses of playing with each other but he got injured.

defeat at home to Partick just  days ago.They dealt with everything thrown at them by the Wasps and chances continued to come at the other end with Hemmings close to grabbing a third early on, bringing a good save from MacDonald. vw, px\"  He turned provider with  minutes left on the clock as he burst past a defender and, instead of shooting, cut the ball across for the waiting Sean Mackie to roll the ball into the empty net with his first touch after coming off the bench.Manager McPake had been full of praise for the efforts of his frontman over the past few weeks eventhe goals hadn’t been flowing with none in his previous seven outings.He wasn’t too complimentary about Hemmings’ miss late on, however, as the -year-old blazed the ball over the bar with the goal gaping to pass up the chance of a treble.Despite that, it was an excellent night’s work from the striker and one that will give the Dens faithful plenty to be excited about for the rest of the campaign.With Dorrans pulling the strings in the middle, a defence looking solid and a real goal- getter in scoring form, the Dark Blues are starting to look like they mean business in the Championship title race."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery. We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site. Nothing will change in respect to their co-operative membership of First Milk, and we will continue to collect and pay for their milk on the same basis as before.#James Barbour, chairman of the Kintyre steering group, added: #It was the right thing to investigate all avenues to seewe could keep the creamery open in Kintyre. There was widespread enthusiasm from the local farmers to try to secure the future of the site and genuine support from First Milk, the Scottish Government and the local community, along with a successful crowdfunding campaign.#Despite all of this we were not able to find a financially viable long-term solution for the creamery. I would like to thank everyone who has supported us through this period.#John Smith, NFUS dairy chairman and local Kintyre dairy farmer, said: #My heart goes out to all the staff that work at the creamery and it is regrettable that the Mull of Kintyre brand that we have passionately supported will now no longer be available. That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

Behailu Kebede, in flat , was found to be entirely blameless, having done all the right things on being woken by his smoke alarm and spotting the fire.:Clutha crash caused by pilots failure to check fuel pumps, inquiry findsHe called for help, closed the kitchen door, alerted neighbours and waited for the fire brigade. Hours later  people would be dead.What becomes more complex - and what is under dispute - is who was, then, to blame for the events of June , . There has been outrage at the suggestion the London Fire Brigade is responsible and pleas that fire fighters should not be made scapegoats for the fatal incident.At the same time there have been calls for the services chief, Dany Cotton, to resign after failures from the service to alter its \"stay put\" advice to residents inside the burning building. Sir Martins report makes clear that more could have been saved had the building being evacuated sooner.The inquirys second phase, expected to be finished in , five years after the fire, will be a deeper investigation into how the fire could have happened in the first place.Footage being shared earlier this week showed Boris Johnson in , responding to concerns raised about cuts he made to the fire service while Mayor of London, with the words \"get stuffed\". The video of the meeting, held not long before the Grenfell disaster, shows a colleague of Mr Johnson raising the issue of a lack of fire safety in housing as a result of the cuts. Get stuffed.It seems far too simplistic to blame the fire crews when, at the top, there was such utter disdain for the service and the resources needed for fire safety.:Inside Clutha pub after helicopter crash revealed as FAI rules pilot errorAt the Clutha Fatal Accident Inquiry it was clear from the start that families of the victims who died when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of the Glasgow pub did not want the pilot to face sole blame.Instead, they wanted to know whether there had been systemic failings at the top - was there a problem with the helicopter  Had there been problems with training or management or maintenance It was a far cry from the last major Fatal Accident Inquiry in the city when automatic sympathy for the driver of a bin lorry that ran out of control on Queen Street and killed six people quickly turned to disgust as it became apparent he, Harry Clarke, had lied about previous health problems.Yet in the one case where blame did appear to sit with the man at the bottom, rather than come from the top down, Mr Clarke faced no criminal charges.While suspicion of pilot error had been an immediate suggestion and then constant explanation almost since the day of the crash, the Clutha families, and bar owner Alan Crossan, were clear that they did not simply want Captain David Traill to take the blame for the deaths of their loved ones.Captain Traills fianceacutee Lucy Thomas was represented at the inquiry, which ran from April to August this year, and her QC, Shelagh McColl, asked that Captain Traill - an \"extremely accomplished and experienced pilot\" - not be blamed for the crash.Sherf Principal Craig Turnbull could not give her what she asked for. His findings stated that the crash could have been avoided had Captain Traill followed procedure set down in the Pilots Checklist, realised that two fuel transfer pump switches were \"off\" and so not sending fuel to the supply tanks, and switched these on.Had the switches been turned on, there was enough fuel on board to feed the twin engines and the helicopter would have made it back to Glasgow Heliport.This is baldly put and stood out as unfair to the families who had heard evidence lead which gave reasons why Captain Traill might not have checked the switches and why he might not have responded as per the Pilots Checklist in response to low fuel warnings.Captain Traill was wrong to ignore the five low fuel warnings that sounded during the final flight but the court heard clear reasons - relating to issues with fuel sensors in the EC helicopter - why he might logically have ignored them.A less highlighted fact, and one important to mention, is that Sherf Turnbull also found that had Airbus included an aural attention-getter that sounded when both fuel transfer pumps were switched off, the crash might have been avoided.So, disappointment for the families with regards to blaming Captain Traill and not anyone further up the chain.Disappointment too at feeling removed from the process of the inquiry which they waited six years to attend.On behalf of Mary Kavanagh, the partner of victim Robert Jenkins, QC Donald Findlay said that those who died and their families had \"merited scarcely a mention\". It was a sentiment repeated by those loved ones who turned up day after day to the inquiry and sat, dignied, through what must have been evidence traumatic for them to hear.Some wanted questions put to the emergency services who had attended the victims. \"No evidence has been led to show what more,anything, could have been done to save them,\" Mr Findlay again. \"It is submitted that this is what people would wish to know and are entitled to know.\"Of course families wanted clear answers to their questions but, without a black box recorder in the helicopter, any answers were only ever going to be hypotheses. The sherf, too, cannot be solely motivated by pleasing the victims and relatives when conducting a fatal accident inquiry. That is not his role.For those intimately involved it is impossible to separate emotions from proceedings and emotions do not always guide us well.However, it has been acknowledged by James Wolffe, the Lord Advocate, that the FAI system must better involve the bereaved and survivors with improved information sharing. He had pledged additional funding to achieve this, and to speed up a system whereby y delays can further traumatise victims.Sherf Turnbull, in his Clutha conclusions, also highlight the issue of the impact delays have on those involved.The families of those who died in the Clutha accident are not satisfied with the outcome of this inquiry but they will perhaps be satisfied with these acknowledgements.One certainty, at the end of six years, is that the families involved deserve praise for the dignity with which they conducted themselves throughout. Those at the top must match them in a resolve to speed up and improve the system."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-set-host-bbc-question-time-run-general-election","story":"The BBCs flagship debate show will see a  of politicians grilled by Glasgow locals on November  - despite a storm of controversy over the make up of previous selections.:Fresh row as BBC respond to SNP complaints over Question TimeIn a calling notice for audience members, the corporation asked for those who have been part of the programme in the last ten years \"not to apply\" to give \"others a chance\".Those applying to join the  will be contacted on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, with the recording to take place on Thursday.Provisional audience members have also been warned not everyone who applies will receive a callbackIt comes amid a storm of controversy regarding allegations of bias levelled against the corporation over previous editions of the programme.In July, the SNP lodged a formal complaint with the BBC following a row over ex-Conservative MSP Mary Scanlon appearing in the audience during a taping of the show in Elgin.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ymYRRaL poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ymYRRaL.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Viewers criticise BBC Question Time after former Tory MSP, Mary Scanlon, appears in audienceHowever, the corporations editorial complaints department found \"no breach\" of standards or policies in relation to the accusation.Complaints director Jeremy Hayes said:ldquoI have reviewed the programme and I can confirm that at one point after a number of speakers, some of whom were in favour ofindependenceforScotland, had criticised theSNP, Fiona Bruce did ask for a contribution from an SNP supporter in the audience.\"Applications to be in the audience can be completed here."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-always-look-gloomy-side-life","story":"ITrsquoS with a fatalistic sense of doom that the Diary acknowledges there will be a General Election in December.

He identied some of the capitalist criminals Labour is coming for, including Sir Jim Ratclfe of Ineos. Though its not clear under what law the polluting plutocrats could be prosecuted.So, is this class war in the UK  Are we on the road to Venezuela  Whatever the polls say, a Labour victory this Christmas is quite possible with Nigel Farages Brexit Party now splitting the Tory vote. There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Atlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labours policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a le-long member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Mr Corbyn will still enter Number Ten with a raft of left wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich till the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools, and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axing tax reliefs worth about pound.billionSimilarly, seizing ten percent of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by share-holders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labours policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed form Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, child care for  and  year olds, scrapping the right-to-buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax - these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnt be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labours Green New Deal. A majority of voters agree there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thats only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution. Labours policy would mean decarbonising transport, home heating and agriculture in a decade. Millions of cars would have to be scrapped along with millions of home heating boilers. Air travel would all but cease.Labour promises a huge investment in renewable industries, to compensate, but that is unlikely to replace the jobs lost in the car industry, oil and gas, road haulage, retail.So expect the Green New Deal to become somewhat lighter green in government. There is likely to be a rt between the Thunberg-supporting ldquode-growthers and Labour MPs, who traditionally see economic growth as the best way to address poverty and inequality.However, Britain already has a rather good record on eliminating greenhouse emissions, and this will continue, albeit with the  taget reduced to % net zero. In sum, Labour offers a practical social democratic programme which could be very attractive to voters, especially younger ones. However there is one very big problem: Brexit.Labour is committed to negotiating a new Withdrawal Deal to replace Boris Johnsonsand to putting this to another Brexit referendum. This will consume a vast amount of political capital and will surely dominate the first year of a Labour government.Mr Corbyn wants to reintroduce the Customs Union, and Brussels would probably agree to that. But Labour also want close regulatory alignment with the European Single Market, which the EU  would probably reject. If Britain wants to be in the single market, it will have to join the single market, probably via the European Economic Area, along with Norway.Labour could go along with that in the end, since it wants friction-free access to the EU markets. Single market membership would solve the Irish border problem, for sure. But it would also mean Britain continuing to contribute to the EU Budget, while having no say over decisions taken by Brussels. Customs Union membership requires oversight by the European Court of Justice, which will displease many.But that wouldnt be the main problem. If Labour got this wonderful deal, including workers rights and environmental standards, and got it through parliament , would it really then campaign against it in the confirmatory referendum Interviewers have largely stopped asking this question, because they never get an answer, but Europe remains a huge question mark hanging over Labours government agenda.Labour is still a Brexit party, though you wouldnt know to listen to most MPs. Many figures in the party are closet Brexiteers, like Jeremy Corbyn himself. Others are openly pro-Brexit, like the party chairman Ian Lavery and the MPs who voted for Boris Johnsons Deal.Equally dedicated Remainers ndash mostly Blairites and supporters of the deputy leader Tom Watson ndash would fight back, insisting that Labour effectively promised to back Remain in the general election. Brexit wrangling could delay the confirmatory referendum and ide the party, just as it split the Tories.Corbyns enemies will ignite further ision by condemning him as antisemitic. It will take immense powers of leadership to prevent a Labour government being halted in its radical tracks by Brexit. The question for voters is: does Jeremy Corbyn posses it "},{"url":null,"title":"herald-view-voters-deserve-derision-denunciation-deceit","story":"Thatrsquos because the central issue, Brexit, is by its nature isive. In Scotland, we have the additional but equally isive issue of independence. Current polling and conventional wisdom suggest that the Conservatives should obtain a majority across England and Wales, and the SNP will perform very strongly in Scotland. But as the last general election campaign and the current unreliability of polling have shown, those apparent positions could be quite dferent by December .There are the usual unforeseeable factors of any campaign: blunders by candidates, external events, issues other than those the parties anticipatecoming to the fore. Even without those, however, the arithmetic is fiendishly tricky to calculate. No one knows the degree to which, for example, support for the Conservatives ndash or, for that matter, many Labour MPs ndash may be undermined by the Brexit Party. Nor the extent to which tactical voting against Brexit may benefit the Liberal Democrats or the SNP.It is assumed that the strength of Remain sentiment bodes well for the Nationalists, but  per centis not a negligible proportion of the electorate ndash itrsquos more than the SNP secured at the last general election, when they took  per cent of the countryrsquos Westminster seats. Andthe focus turns from Brexit to a second independence referendum, it is as likely that Unionists will vote tactically as it is that Remain and Leave voters will. Given the number of marginal seats, how hotly they will be contested, and the first-past-the-post system, any of the parties could see gains being offset by losses.The picture is just as unclear where in the UK splits in either the Leave or Remain votes could allow unexpected gains for almost any party. Butpoliticians and their most vehement supporters can have no certainty about the results, nor should they claim a monopoly on the truth, or moral virtue, of their arguments.One expects candidates and activists to paint themselves in the best light, and their opponents in the worst, but ision should not be exploited to mislead and to coarsen public discourse. Even before the campaigns have begun, there have been unpleasant instances of abuse ndash and equally dangerous attempts to claim robust criticism, within the normal bounds of political speech, amounts to abuse. There may be little prospect of restraining the more extreme rhetoric which appears on social media, but the electorate deserve an effort from those who seek their vote to conduct themselves honestly, and to give consideration in their thinking, rhetoric and pledges to those who may vehemently disagree with their position.Division may be unavoidable we may also fail, in the end, to get a genuinely decisive result.

woodland, as opposed to the actual Clootie Well site itself, which is, letrsquos say,  yards by  yards or something like that.ldquoThe cloots had actually extended out to  or  yards. It was just a huge expansion of the site.ldquoBut at the actual site round the Clootie Well itself, we didnrsquot remove anything other than possibly inappropriate stuff such as umbrellas, sunglasses, a pair of trainers.ldquoThere was a colossal amount of stuff around that was totally inappropriate.However, Mr Stott said those involved were careful to show respect to people who had placed genuine offerings around the well.He added: ldquoItrsquos peoplersquos wishes, peoplersquos hopes, obviously, that they are hanging on these trees.ldquoWe did it with as much respect and dignity as we possibly could.He continued: ldquoThe idea basically is you hang up a wee bit of cloth, and as that cloth biodegrades it draws away the illness of the person who you have hung it up for.ldquoSo thatrsquos the theory,you like, or the history of it. But things like sunglasses are clearly never, ever going to biodegrade.He said those who initially expressed concerns over the clean-up were reassured once the purpose of it was made clear.And he suggested an annual drive to keep the surrounding area tidy could be in order in future.He added: ldquoI wouldnrsquot quite say we havenrsquot scratched the surface, but Irsquom quite sure the same exercise could be done again and it still wouldnrsquot actually affectthe character.ldquoI would like to see some kind of annual event ndash done tastefully, done as a family thing, just to make sure that we keep on top of the non-biodegradables and we donrsquot end up back in the same situation.Clootie wells ndash or sites drawing on similar traditions ndash can be found where in Scotland and the UK, but few possess the unsettling atmosphere found in Munlochy.Its strange power even inspired elements of Ian Rankinrsquos novel The Naming of the Dead.While it is associated with a holy well, such healing traditions pre-date Christianityand the area has become an important site for those with a iety of beliefs and none.Maree Morrison, of Forestry and Land Scotland, said  volunteers took part in the clean-up from the local communities of Munlochy, Avoch and Knockbain, as well as from further across the Black Isle and Easter Ross.She said: ldquoThe site was expanding rapidly, with the surrounding woodland being badly affected by non-biodegradable items as they built up over the years.ldquoThere were cloots tied around trees and information posts in the car park.ldquoThe items had crept out from the well up to  metres out into the woodland, and the local community felt that it was getting too much and was detracting from the traditional nature of the healing well.Ms Morrison said volunteers removed a iety of unsuitable items including empty dog poo bags, entire pairs of jeans, a window blind and even an electrical sander.Forestry and Land Scotland is now requesting that any offerings left at the site are restricted to natural cotton or wool. Any plastics, polyesters or other materials will be removed."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-sturgeons-pitch-voters-may-not-survive-spotlight","story":"But elections are like the old joke about making God laugh. How to do it  Tell him your plans. This election, already as flaky and unpredictable as any I can remember, will not be dictated by the crossed fingers of party leaders.Try as they might to plot a particular course, they will be buffeted and blown about. Events, the Kryptonite of politics, come thick and fast in elections, and this one promises events galore.Mr Johnsonrsquos decision to press ahead for a Christmas poll already looks ropey. Nigel Farage and the Brexit party threw him for a loop yesterday with a choice between a pro-Brexit pact endorsed by Donald Trump or a split Leave vote.The PM has also had to grin weakly through multiple TV interviews about his failure to get Brexit done by October  despite his do-or-die bravado.The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters, they got it right. He failed. He may try to blame parliament, but itrsquos the same parliament that was there when he made his promise. His sales pitch in the Tory leadership contest was that he, uniquely, could break the impasse. Boris the Bold was supposed to wrestle MPs into submission or toss them out the ring and get some new ones. Instead they gave the gloating grappler an octave-raising wedgie.The relentless nature of election campaigning means party leaders are never able to retreat from their mistakes and let a storm blow over. There is always a camera or a microphone barrelling towards them. There will be a price for such an enormous flop.Pledges and policies are also inspected and dissected in the public square in a way they seldom are outside of an election. What starts the day on paper as a tidy soundbite can end it a disheveled mess. Positions that at first appear reasonable can turn to nonsense when chewed over at .Take Ms Sturgeonrsquos comments yesterday on having a democratic double-dip in . Out campaigning in Leith, the First Minister predicted a Labour government would grant a second independence referendum.Mr Corbyn has said he is open to it, subject to a few years delay to let Labour get underway in office, and provided it follows a democratic process, perhaps a fresh mandate in a Holyrood election. Ms Sturgeon seemed very confident.Talking to the media, she said: ldquoEveryone knows, you all know, therersquos going to be an independence referendum. The opposition parties might not yet have got round to conceding that point but they and know and everybody knows it.Ms Sturgeonrsquos dream scenario is a minority Labour government that needs SNP support to survive, giving her the leverage to secure Indyref.Labour counters that the SNPrsquos hand would not be as strong as it thinks. It has no nuclear option. Ms Sturgeon could hardly swing behind the ToriesLabour refused to oblige, or let the government fall and the Tories in. The SNP would be accused of another , when it helped oust Jim Callaghan and along came Margaret Thatcher.But a minority Labour government would not really be in a position to play hardball with the SNP. To legislate for the transformation Mr Corbyn promises, it would need the votes of SNP MPs. A deal between the SNP and Labour,not a formal coalition, seems a credible bet in such circumstances.But then Ms Sturgeon was asked a series of follow-up questions. The more her position was interrogated, the shakier it became. Would she compromise on her timetable of Indyref in the second half of   ldquoNo, Irsquove set out my timing. Is there a public appetite for two referendums in   ldquoYes. Is there a risk a Remain vote would diminish support for independence  ldquoNo, I donrsquot think so.Mr Corbyn claims he would get Brexit done in six months by having a Peoplersquos Vote. Which should come first - EU referendum or Indyref  Here Ms Sturgeon said something extraordinary. Apparently the order doesnrsquot matter.ldquoThe most important thing is not what comes first, itrsquos about why these things are important, ldquo she said.ldquoA second EU referendum is about giving the whole of the UK a chance to escape Brexit. A second referendum is about giving Scotland the chance that never, ever again, on Brexit or anything , do we find ourselves in a position where our future is being decided by the likes of Boris Johnson, not the people who live here.But the order is so obviously important itrsquos almost asthis stuff is being made up on the hoof. If Scots voted first for independence they wouldnrsquot get a vote on Brexit. The die would have been cast. Itrsquos also obvious Labour would prioritise its UK-wide promise on Brexit ahead of Indyref.So , in line with Ms Sturgeonrsquos plan, there were two votes in , it would be EU first then Indyref. But what would that look like  The SNP would have to campaign for Remain despite Brexit being the grounds for Indyref. Activists might be a bit queasy about unpicking their lsquotriple-lockrsquo mandate.Andthe result was Remain - and assuming Indyref wasnrsquot axed off as a consequence - the SNP would have to go back to the country immediately and argue it didnrsquot matter. Remain, Leave, whatever, we still need independence.That would echo early , when Ms Sturgeon first called for Indyref because of Brexit. She was ahead of public sentiment then. The two issues didnrsquot seem sufficiently linked to justy a new referendum, and the SNP was punished a few months later at the election for indecent haste.Since then, sentiment has moved in the SNPrsquos favour and independence and Brexit are seen as closely linked, the former offered as the way out of the latter. Ms Sturgeonrsquos efforts to fuse the two has paid off, with support for independence rising due almost entirely to No-Remainers becoming Yes-Remainers. Butshe gets her Remain result next year, she must convince a knackered nation to separate then again. Itrsquos a muddle.Ms Sturgeon might argue that, evenit is Remain, Scotland darenrsquot risk another Brexit-like disaster inside the Union. But whatrsquos like Brexit  Is there another white whale out there  Would voters be irresistibly drawn to more constitutional upheaval after settling four years of it just in case If thatrsquos the plan, I donrsquot think itrsquos only God whorsquoll be laughing."},{"url":null,"title":"fleabags-hot-priest-inspired-new-influencers","story":"A vicar influencer who has been compared to Fleabags \"hot priest\" has said he is trying to \"invade social media\" with a message of hope.The Rev Chris Lee, , has more than , followers on an Instagram account on which he mixes snapshots of his home le featuring his we and daughters with \"-second sermons\" and theological musings.\"Social media is a tool, its neither good nor bad, but a lot of the time its used for a very vain pursuit in a superficial way,\" Mr Lee said.\"Im trying to invade that space with faith, with positivity, with hope.\"Most of the time what people see on Instagram is someone saying, look how beautul I am, look how good I am, and Im trying to say to the person watching, youre beautul or youre valued or youre loved.\"Mr Lee, who is the vicar at St Saviours Church in west London, came to the job by an unusual route.With a house, a mortgage and career in business by the age of , he found himself looking for something dferent and moved to Tanzania initially to teach English at a mission.With the Bible as his main teaching tool, he began \"thinking more about God and hearing his voice\", so he stayed and did a distance learning degree to become a priest, eventually being ordained a deacon in the diocese of Mount Kilimanjaro at the age of .At the time he moved to St Saviours four years ago, his brother-in-law was also setting up a couple of YouTube channels -

I have done that during the time I have been Deputy Speaker. I have exerted authority with kindness and courtesy and the attitude and atmosphere I have generated from the Chair is one of keeping things calm rather than whipping up aggression.Throughout the interview, the MP for Epping Forest since  chose her words carefully and one had to read between the lines to get a sense of what she really thought of Mr Bercowrsquos Speakership good on modernity, not so good on his sometimes forceful treatment of MPs.ldquoI believe in doing things properly I believe in the rule of law, she insisted, adding: ldquoThe way in which we make our laws should not only be fair but be seen to be fair.The Scot, who has been Deputy Speaker for six years, explained how in some ways Parliament had developed a split personality.ldquoIf you have MPs from all dferent parties in the queue in the tea-room, everyone is absolutely lovely. People are laughing and joking with one another and having nice conversations about their families. The atmosphere is great.ldquoWhen you have same group of people on a quiet Thursday afternoon debating something to do with autistic children, you still get a group of people working well together for the common good, acting in a courteous and pleasant way.ldquoThen we come onto PMQs or the Budget debate or Brexit. Aggression takes the place of argument. High octane, unpleasant interaction. Thatrsquos a point where we have to take action to calm things down.Dame Eleanor, who this week was at the sharp end of a Government whip shouting aggressively at her from just a few feet away during the early election debate, suggested it was an ldquoage-old reality that women did things dferently from men.ldquoThe less testosterone the better the behaviour, she declared.Askedshe was suggesting Westminster had become something of a Jekyll and Hyde Parliament, she replied: ldquoYes. We have. Thatrsquos right. It is almost Jekyll and Hyde. Itrsquos so sad we are observed to behave in a certain way when  per cent of the time we behave decently. I want that to be  per cent of the time. Itrsquos a challenge but itrsquos not impossible and it could be achieved in pretty short order.ldquoWersquore going to have a new Parliament and a new Speaker andI were in the Chair I could get this new Parliament off to a good start.As well as calling for a ldquocomprehensive review of how the Commons works, including how to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood, Dame Eleanor also made clear that one policy adopted following the  independence referendum was not fit for purpose: English Votes for English Laws or EVEL for short.This law, which requires matters affecting just England to have a majority of English MPs to pass, has proved controversial with a charge of creating two classes of MPs and another that it politicises the role of the Speaker as he or she determines when EVEL should be applied.ldquoItrsquos not working well. I never liked it, I never supported it. I see it working from the Chair in a way which people have not paid attention to. It ought to be reviewed.Askedshe personally believed it should be abolished, the Scot replied: ldquoYes. Itrsquos a very good principle that you shouldnrsquot make long-term laws to solve short-term problems. Another good example is the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. A long-term law to solve a short-term problem in  which has backfired badly.She pointed out thatthe FTPA was not scrapped, then ldquowersquoll have to have every General Election in December.Having spent another afternoon schmoozing with colleagues in the Commons tea-room, Dame Eleanor seemed upbeat, saying how colleagues had been pledging support for her candidacy.ldquoI have had such good reactions from colleagues over the last few days I have been touched by the support I have had and how lovely people are being, she purred.But there was a rider. ldquoCome on, this is an election within Parliament not everyone who said they would vote for me will do so. But itrsquos very nice for people to come up to you and wish you good luck and say: ldquoIrsquom with you.rsquo Why botheryoursquore not Askedshe was confident she could win, there was an extended pause which might have given the game away. ldquoIhellipthink there is every chance I can do it.Dame Eleanor and the rest of us will know on Monday afternoon just how MPs have really voted.

Indeed, they still do in benighted foreign lands. But, here, we complain that it might be too dark or a bit nippy and, evenit isnrsquot, we canrsquot be bothered because wersquove got busy schedules of reality TV to watch.And all this in the run-up to Christmas tae. The Dailycartoonist Matt quipped: ldquoAt least a December election will put paid to all that lsquoSeason of Goodwillrsquo nonsense.The cry also went up: ldquoBut what about the nativity plays  The what now  I havenrsquot been to school for a while, and never paid much attention when I was there. But are they seriously still forcing the inmates to re-enact scenes from the Middle East , years ago  Come to think of it, I canrsquot remember having these at my primary school. Maybe that was just Leith, right enough. I think we only did May Day and Leninrsquos birthday.It would be finethe election was all about Leith Man but the doughty old port suffers from the disadvantage of being Scottish and so could never be representative of Britain. Instead, theyrsquove decided that itrsquos Workington Man who should be the successor to previous incarnations of electoral barometer such as Essex Man and Worcester Woman, not to mention ious vehicular representatives such as Mondeo Man and White Van Man.The Pebbledash People were also adduced at one point, but the least said about them the better. In Leith, theyrsquod have been put up against a wall.The Workington Man concept comes from centre-right think-tank Onward, and is predicated on targeting older working-class Leave voters without degrees in gender studies or vegan sociology, who are worried about crime and immigration, which liberals living in prosperous, all-white areas say they ought just to thole.Itrsquos currently a Labour seat with an unrepresentative Remainer MP, which has led many stout proletarians to say theyrsquore going to vote Conservative this time. Thatrsquos well weird. But itrsquos the same in other northern English towns like Warrington and Wigan where, as one psephologist said, most voters would normally never give the Tories the steam from their tinkles.But now, feeling alienated from and despised by the haut-liberal establishment, many are thinking of going further than offering not just the vaporous by-products of micturition but also their votes.Not all of them are saying this, of course. Some Workington citizens have taken offence at the stereotype pinned to them, and many proletarian Leavers simply could never vote Conservative, even with clothes pegs on their proboscises.Itrsquos the latter vote that the Brexit Party of Mr Nigel Farridgeis banking on picking up. Yesterday, at the launch of their election campaign, the spiv-style statesman said that,the Tories thought they were going to win northern English Labour seats, they needed to get out of the office more.He believes his party are better placed to take the Labour Leave vote because, unlike the Tories, they donrsquot yet have a history of being horrible. The Brexit Party might plausibly claim also to be a broader church, apparently including even some ex-Communists, and as far as I can make out, it hasnrsquot overtly extolled the virtues of the enslaving free market as Boris Johnsonrsquos Tories do at every turn.Of course, a few people in Workington and where will continue voting Labour on a tribal basis, believing it still to be the party of the working person . The partyrsquos launch this week showcased several attractive proposals for punishing the rich, with even some encouraging talk that there should be no billionaires in Britain, and itrsquos possible that decent people everywhere might support this.But maybe not in Workington, which has had enough of Labour promises. Irsquom guessing that old industrial Leith, meanwhile, will stick with the SNP, particularly with its attractive policy on trans-gender issues.As for how Irsquom going to vote, Irsquom afraid itrsquos not my place to say.++++IF you were genuinely open-minded, and not a liberal, you might concede that there are some things to admire about Boris Johnson. Well, two: the humour and erudition.And, of course, there are a few things to dislike, including the not inconsiderable fact that hersquos a Tory. However, a clinching factor against him for many decent ratepayers is the fact that hersquos a cyclist. And,the account of one former journalistic colleague is anything to go by, he typies the breed.Stephen Robinson recalled: ldquo[Following] Boris on a bike is a very dangerous undertaking indeed. When traffic is gridlocked, Boris shimmies along the inside lane, propelling himself with his left foot along the kerb. He crosses red lights, he cuts up the largest lorries.Textbook stuff. Voting is an important business and, when weighing up candidates, it is important to consider several factors: their hairstyle, football team, alcohol intake and mode of transport.Few people beyond the pedalling narcissi themselves would knowingly vote for a cyclist. My own view is that, as with bald people, cyclists should not be allowed to vote never mind stand for election. However, Irsquom aware that this policy is not popular among the closed-minded.++++A SURVEY of , adults found the majority wouldnrsquot dream of going to the cinema or dining out on their own. The study, commissioned by hotel brand Staybridge Suites, also found many wouldnrsquot attend the pub or the football or a museum on their own.How peculiar. The only one I concur with is dining out. I used to do it when younger, not knowing it was problematic. But I soon noticed I was getting stared at by other diners, most often those couples who never exchange a word.Chinese restaurants were the worst. In two establishments, I looked up to find the entire staff staring. And they donrsquot flinch when you stare back.Of course, I cannot discount the possibility that I look bizarre. Somebody once said I resembled a character from The Lord of the Ringsand itrsquos true also that I used to be a martyr to red-face disease rosacea .But none of that is an excuse for such bovine staring. So,dining alone is called for, Irsquoll do it in rather than oot, thanks.++++WE live in fast times. By the time I finish this sentence, many of you online will already have moved on, to find something bilious about Brexit or fitbarsquo or dancing cats. Losers.However, I cannot say Irsquove been bothered by the furore over a new Netflix feature allowing viewers to speed up or slow down films and TV shows.Itrsquos mainly film-makers and actors whose underwear has been formed into a bent, curling or distorted shape by the development. They say the move has a similar effect on the artwork and resent such interference.But itrsquos long been available on DVDs, and I canrsquot remember using it much. On TVs, too, you can apparently fast-forward through the adverts on recorded programmes.The new Netflixis currently only available to Android users, ie punters with portable telephones.

The opinion polls, putting the Scottish Tories on just  per cent, down almost eight points since their impressive performance in , point to losses among their  seats where the SNP is the main challenger in all of them.But Mr Jack was having none of it, insisting that in fighting hard to retain all  Scottish seats, the Conservatives, by promoting themselves as the party of Brexit, could win more, possibly by getting supporters of Nigel Faragersquos party to switch to them.ldquoIf they back Brexit, the only party that is going to deliver Brexit out of this General Election is the Scottish Conservative Party. If you want Brexit, vote Conservative, declared the Secretary of State.He acknowledged: ldquoWe do start from  per cent but we also have the Brexit Party with six or seven per cent. We are the party that can deliver Brexit. We have a Brexit deal which we will be putting into our manesto and we will be the only party going to the electorate and saying give us a majority to get Brexit out of the way, get Brexit finished.But, of course, while Brexit might dominate the battle for No  south of the border, the perennial constitutional question is once again set to be at the forefront in the political fight north of it.With the SNP making clear that ldquoScotlandrsquos right to choose will be the central plank of its campaign, Mr Jack indicated that ldquostanding four-square against a second independence referendum would be at the heart of the Conservativesrsquo.A recent snapshot placed Scottish independence on  per cent support, causing the First Minister to claim that tide for Scotland breaking with the Union was on the rise.Askedshe was right to make the claim, the Scottish Secretary declared: ldquoI donrsquot accept that because the poll, which the Andrew Wilsonrsquos Commission suppressed, showed  per cent of those who voted to leave the UK in  have now changed their mind and the Survation poll that came out on the fth anniversary of the Scottish referendum on independence showed  per cent of the Scottish population wanted to remain in the United Kingdom.ldquoWe have a really strong case to put on that. Separation would be a terrible thing for Scotland. As we leave the EU we need to strengthen the Scottish economy and we will do that by taking away uncertainty, explained Mr Jack.Ms Sturgeon has insisted thatthe SNP got a majority of Scottish MPs at the election, then that would be an ldquoirresistible demand for indyref and the UK Govt would be dutybound to facilitate a second vote.ldquoNo, she absolutely would say that, wouldnrsquot she, declared the Cabinet minister.He argued that the Nationalist leader ldquopersistently finds reasons to promote independence and her call for a second vote to ldquodistract people from the real problem in Scotland, which is, after a decade in power, they have failed to improve our NHS, failed to improve our education service, failed to improve public services. So, they distract us by constantly harping on about independence.But askedhe was saying that evenMs Sturgeon and her party succeeded in getting a majority of Scots MPs at the election, they would not have a mandate for indyref, Mr Jack replied: ldquoIrsquom absolutely saying they would not have a mandate.ldquoTo me, itrsquos very simple. We had a once-in-a-generation, her words, once-in-a-letime, she and the First Minister at the time Alex Salmond used those expressions, referendum in , we had that, the people of Scotland decided to stay in the UK and they should respect that referendum and they should respect the referendum in , which was a UK one.He went on: ldquoWe do not need and we do not want to have another independence referendum. We should take separation right off the agenda, deliver Brexit, which got a majority of  votes in Parliament, the Second Reading of the Bill, come back, deliver Brexit and start focusing on the good things wersquore doing for Scotland the City and growth deals, bringing COP to Glasgow next year. Letrsquos start delivering on the good things we can do for the Scottish economy, growing that economy, growing peoplersquos prosperity as part of the UK.The Secretary of State stressed how Scotland had suffered the ldquodouble whammy of ision with the  and  votes and the task for a new Tory government would be to seek to heal the nation under Mr Johnsonrsquos premiership.ldquoBoth those referenda have been very isive but not just in terms of politics but in terms of families, relationships it has not been a good period in our history but we have to get Brexit sorted, push back the independence question, and start pulling together. We are all in the same rowing boat and letrsquos pull on the oars together. Thatrsquos my message.Last night, Ian Blackford for the SNP made clear thathis party did secure a majority of MPs in Scotland the UK Government could not stand in the way of indyref.ldquoAlister Jack has to recognise we already have a mandate for an independence referendum from the  elections. This time round we will be asking people to support Scotlandrsquos right to choose. The Conservatives cannot ignore democracy, he declared.In the interview, Mr Jack also said:*a new Tory Government would not seek to rush through a Withdrawal Bill in December as there would be ldquoenough time in January to do it*the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, that restricts Governments in how to call an election, had ldquonot served us well in the last month and I would suggest we revisit it when we *eventhere had to be a ldquoflextension to the December  Implementation Period, the UK would leave the Common Fisheries Policy in  monthsrsquo time and*getting Brexit done would open up the ldquosunny uplands of potential trade deals with other countries."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-independent-scotland-within-touching-distance","story":"She said \"another clear win\" for the SNP at theGeneral Electionnext month will \"bring it even closer still\".The SNP leader is the headline speaker at the event in George Square, her first speech at an independence rally since the  independence referendum campaign.Ahead of the event, she said: \"A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, and to put Scotlands future in Scotlands hands - not Boris Johnsons.\"This election really is the most important one Scotland has faced in modern times.\"So much is on the line - people are completely fed up with the mess at Westminster.\"But George Square will be packed today as people from all backgrounds join together to demand a better future for Scotland.\"An independent Scotland is closer than it has ever been.

It is a fine and atmospheric town centre to walk around. Hopefully it can regain its vibrancy of bygone days.Ian McConnellCumbernauldIts a place where its reputation definitely precedes it ... a dump, a concrete nightmare, a Plook on the Plinth.But, really ... no, honestly ... Cumbernauld is actually a really good place to live. We moved our family there  years ago, our children have grown up there, and the fact they have thrived is in no small part down to their surroundings.Its relatively crime-free, its got good schools, good facilities, and no matter where you are theres green space just a stones throw away.The best thing  The transport links. Were  minutes walk from a railway station where we can go to Edinburgh or Glasgow, and the same distance from a bus stop that will get us into Glasgow in as little as  minutes .The worst thing  The town centre. Someone really needs to put it out of its misery, knock it down and build something that doesnt fill you with gloom every time you go there.Andy ClarkEast KilbrideEAST Kilbride is South Lanarkshirersquos largest town but is widely recognised for its enthusiasm towards roundabouts.When you tell a stranger thatrsquos where you live, it is the first thing they point out not the fact it was designated Scotlandrsquos first new town in May .It is a quiet place to live, appealing mainly to families with Calderglen and James Hamilton Park right on your doorstep.The village, which includes the oldest part of the town, offers independent restaurants and boutiques.While it might not be the busiest place to live, East Kilbride just is a -minute train journey away from Glasgow.Catherine HunterGreenockWhile it may have made headline news last month when cruise ship passengers staged a mutiny over visiting the town, Greenock is an area of historical importance to Scotland that still has a lot to offer, and remains popular with locals and tourists alike.A shipyard town that has been transformed into an urban area, the town maintains links to its roots and serves as a gateway for many cruise passengers to Scotland.However, it has also sought to strike a balance between being a port town and a modern town. Greenock has been in the grips of a transformation of late, with signicant investment put into the town centre with the likes of The Beacon and The Albany adding to the arts and culture hub in the town. And there is more investment to come that will see the main shopping area, The Oak Mall, to be transformed into a modern day outlet in the near future.While Greenock may have plenty to offer visitors with stunning vistas over the Clyde from the Lyle Hill or The Cut, it is also a town that is aware of what needs to change and is looking to build on its past to secure its future.Stephen McIlkennyLivingstonFrom the baffled looks on the faces of a few of my former Edinburgh colleagues when I told them I was moving to Livingston, you would have thought it was Pyongyang I was flitting to.

In Orkney, Police have joined up with Orkney Road Safety forum, to encourage cyclists to remain safe and visible, with not only education, but the handing out of bike lights.Police are reminding cyclists that along with obeying all traffic signs, traffic light signals and not cycling on pavements, they must equip their bikes with the appropriate lights and make sure they are lit when it starts to get dark.Officers in Orkney will be proactively looking to address cyclists who ignore the legislative requirement to illuminate their bikes in darkness, and will be providing bike lights to those who need them. Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

publicand the less-than ethical conditions in which facial recognition technology is being researched and developed\".Dr Daly stated: \"I urge the committee to consider deeply the impact on the privacy and other human rights of the general public in being subjected to invasive mass-monitoring by facial recognition technology used by police.\"Public place face recognition Dr Garfield Benjamin from Solent University in Southampton also argued Parliament should introduce a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology in public places.\"This should ideally be permanent, or at least until signicant regulatory frameworks have been put in place,\" he said.He added: \"Should facial recognition ever be deployed in Scotland, an independent review and commissioner should be established.\"Police Scotland should focus their already constrained resources on supporting officers more directly to perform their duties and build trust with communities.\"He spoke out against the use of such technology, saying: \"There is an inversion of innocence with facial recognition.\"When a member of the public enters a space monitored by facial recognition, they are automatically placed in a police line-up.\"This fundamentally changes the role and power of the police, from one in which evidence is a case must be built to prove guilt into one in which everyone is assumed guilty all the time.\"Should Police Scotlandgo ahead with the use of facial recognition then they are making an active choice to sht policing into a state of constant surveillance, forcing citizens to live beneath a constant machinic gaze.\"Another submission, from Joe Purshouse of the University of East Anglia, together with Professor Liz Campbell of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and Dr Marcin Betkier and Dr Nessa Lynch, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, argued: \"Any use of facial recognition searching on the UK Police National Database may violate human rights laws, and has particularly serious implications for non-convicted persons, whose images are retained on that database.\"Mitigating concerns first They recommended facial recognition technology \"should not be deployed in a policing context until concerns over the technologys effectiveness and potential bias have been confronted and mitigated\".They went on to suggest a moratorium be put in place \"until statutory provisions specically regulating the use of FRT have been introduced and an oversight and evaluation system has been established\".Gillian MacDonald, Assistant Chief Constable with Police Scotland said that \"fundamentally, opportunities exist to use new technologies, such as facial recognition, to enhance police and law enforcement capabilities\".Police Scotland already has the capability to carry out retrospective facial matching for the prevention and detection of crime using the Police National Database, she said.She stressed: \"We have no current plans to introduce live facial recognition software or any other new biometric technology.\"But Ms MacDonald also said: \"To ensure Police Scotland operates efficiently and effectively it is vital that we continue to explore, scrutinise and adapt by embracing new technologiesand, subject to regulatory parameters, invest for the long term.\"She said the force welcomed plans to establish a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner, adding that Police Scotland would await the decision of MSPs on the legislation for this before proceeding with any proposed use of such biometric technology.Meanwhile sub-committee convener John Finnie said MSPs would \"closely study\" all the submissions they had received.He said \"While the police service need to be able to fight crime effectively, any intrusion into citizens privacy must be proportionate.

They weren’t just losing but being ground into the south-west London soil.We know now the miracle very nearly came off, with Scotland leading - on the last play of the game, only to let in England once again to close out a - draw. I doubt I will ever experience such eye-popping, man-hugging drama at a rugby match again. It was my team, my country, and I still get goosebumps thinking about it.: South Africa captain Siya Kolisi ready for shot at history: Defence coach says England can pile pressure on South AfricaBut whisper it up here, Scotland’s shock treatment might just have sparked England’s progress to the Rugby World Cup final in Tokyo, because since that March day they have only lost once, in August when a second string side including only six of today’s starters lost a World Cup warm-up - to Wales in Cardf. A week later, a team featuring  of today’s opening line-up thrashed Ireland -. The chances are anyone reading this column will already know whether Owen Farrell has held the Webb Ellis Trophy aloft orhe was down on his hunkers in despair as the honour fell to a victorious South African captain Siya Kolisi. And I should want the Cup to be raised for the first time by a black Springbok skipper.Pipe band member in But I don’t. I want to see the Veldt Leviathans cut open by the skills of Farrell and George Ford, honed on dimly lit rugby league grounds at Wigan St Pats and Bradford, because I’m supporting England. Always have. Ever since that collection of Esso  Mexico World Cup football coins was completed, I’ve backed England when they aren’t playing us.I was in the pipe band in  when Kenny Dalglish stuck the ball through Ray Clemence’s legs, my mates came back from Wembley the following year with tufts of grass and bits of wood they said were from the obviously tubular goal posts, and in  alongside everyone  I laughed along with Andy Cameron and ‘We’re on the March with Ally’s Army’ and sat stunned as we were undone by Cubillas and Peru. But it was striking how the rest of the country seemed to want Scotland to do well in Argentina, in contrast to those blokes who head to the pub wearing the football shirts of countries they can’t locate on a map when England play.In  I was playing for Preston Grasshoppers when the Grand Slam was won, where Wade Dooley was still learning his trade and couldn’t know he’d experience what it was like to lose to Scotland in a title decider six years later. That day I turned out for Furness RUFC from Barrow, the only Scot in a packed clubhouse where afterwards everyone patted my back and shook my hand asI’d actually been playing at Murrayfield. This morning I’ll be texting a couple of my team-mates from that day.A gun to Zeffirelli’s headYears living in England, playing rugby union and covering professional rugby league has made me feel as much part of their game as ours. The rest of the house is solidly behind England too, but at least my we can justy her support on account of actually being English. So the rest of the gang can claim red and white blood, but even so my hockey-playing daughterstill gets asked by some team-mates how she can support “them” when “we’ll never hear the end of it”. Well we never tire of Archie Gemmill’s goal or  and I’ll never forget Twickenham .There will of course be those who will say that it’s only to be expected from a Conservative, and a lot worse, although there are plenty of our persuasion who are in the Anyone-but-England camp. But I’ve never seen the need to wallow in every set-back suffered by English teams to demonstrate pride in my heritage and culture or the dferences between us, and I’m as quick as the next Scot when abroad to correct anyone who thinks I’m from where. Like the woman in Arizona who saw me in a kilt and askedI was Irish.I am reminded of the story told by Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli when he was a partisan fighter during the War. Trapped between Allied and German forces he gave himself up to what he hoped were friendly troops. “English ” he called, and thought his le was over when a soldier shouted back “No” in a guttural tone he didn’t recognise and put a gun near his head. The soldier hissed, “We’re f***ing Scottish.”Seven ministers in seven yearsTalking of culture, seven ministers in seven years is not a musical based on government departments, but it should be at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, where this week Nicky Morgan announced she will be the latest Secretary of State to depart since Jeremy Hunt’s elevation to health in .For us in the news business, it’s a key appointment, but no sooner had the industry got to know what Maria Miller, Sajid Javid, John Whittingdale, Karen Bradley, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Wright were all about, than it was usually time to move on.Ms Morgan has only been in the job three months, not even enough time to pop into the News Media Association offices for a spot of lunch.

A future where the UK turns in on itself. A future where there is a hostile environment for migrants. That is not the Scotland we want.“The Scotland we seek is open, welcoming and erse.”‘Better alternative’The SNP leader attacked Boris Johnson’s Government, claiming it would not stand up to demands from Donald Trump and that Brexit could weaken the NHS and workers’ rights.She continued: “There is a much better alternative - and not a UK Labour Government that can’t even make up its mind where it stands on the question of Brexit.“The days when Scotland has to make do with the choice of the lesser of two evils - these days must come to an end.”Addressing Mr Johnson and UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Ms Sturgeon said: “Let me send a message to both of them. Why are you so scared of having real debate  I will debate either of you, or both, at any time.“The better alternative for our country is to take our future into our hands and to become an independent country that invests in our people, and invests in public services, and not in Brexit or Trident.“We must come out in numbers and vote in this election to escape the chaos and misery of Brexit, to vote to put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands.“I ask of you, as I prepare to lead you to an independence referendum next year, that we persuade everyone we can in the coming weeks to come out on December  and send the biggest, loudest, most resounding message to Wesminster - that it is time for Scotland to choose our own future, and it is time for Scotland to be an independent country.“Next year our challenge is not just to make sure this city votes Yes in even greater numbers - our challenge and opportunity is to make sure that every part of Scotland votes yes to independence.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: “Nicola Sturgeon has launched a wave of attacks against the Labour Party as she knows we are her biggest threat in this election.“She wants Boris Johnson back in Downing Street as she knows Labour’s transformative programme in government under Jeremy Corbyn will make the best and positive case for remaining in the UK.”Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said: “Annie Wells said: “While Nicola Sturgeon is banging on about indyref, I’m out talking to people about the state of their local schools, the drug deaths crisis and violent crime taking over our streets, and the problems at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. “The SNP took charge of Glasgow City Council and things are even worse than under Labour.“Instead of tackling the day-to-day things that Glaswegians care about, Nicola Sturgeon is headlining a nationalist rally.

I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#. He said the hardest thing was the impact being a councillor can have on elected members# families.#You do have to really know what you#re in for.#Mr Flaws said he had read the hardest part was putting yourself forward in the first place.#To actually make the decision and say #this is the time. It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#. But she said she was prepared to look outside of the town for the solution.#If you#ve got really good shuttle links that would ease some of the congestion. If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands.#If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands# CAROLINE HENDERSONGreen issues were raised by Debra Nicolson, who said the SIC#s economic strategy was supportive of Sullom Voe and the gas plant until at least . Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles receives a right royal welcome to the borders","story":"Photos of his visit to St Boswells are online here: https:www.thesouthernreporter news in-pictures-duke-of-rothesay-s-visit-to-mainstreet-trading-company--"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-BARD-2.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Katie is often helped on her litter picks by Eila and her four year old son Reuben She said: “If my little girlis capable of walking down our road gathering up people’s rubbish which they have selfishly cast from their cars, surely those adults driving the cars can be capable of holding on to their rubbish until they get to a bin. The rural roads around Ballymena are a disgrace.”Katie came across the cat recently during the school run.She said: “Less than  hours after we did the clean-up of our road we came across this poor wee cat caught in a crisp packet just around the corner from us, as we did the school run. This wee creature had totally given up and was just crouched at the roadside, waiting for death. “I pulled the bag off, and it sat stunned for a moment, gasping for breath, before it ran off, terried. I am just so glad we found it in time.”Katie said that because of someones littering “this wee soul nearly died, and a family nearly lost their pet”.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cause of kilrea blaze that gutted house and car under investigation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Dublin city in the mid-s, there were more than , Orangemen - comparative to north Armagh, the home of the Orange Institution. data-dfpadtargetingThe bookletsMr Dougan, who lives in Markethill, said: \"Orangeism had been in decline prior to the Great War, but the turbulent times of the Anglo-Irish War and the Civil War, when there were ious attacks in the early s, made it very dficult for Orange lodges to meet.\"It was a chance event that inspired Mr Dougan to begin researching the \"lost and forgotten\" unionist and loyalist history.\"There was a medal that came up for sale at Whites auction house in Dublin for Achill Island Orange Lodge and I was asked about it. So, that prompted me to start some research and suddenly I began to uncover lots of undocumented facts,\" he said.Mr Dougan regularly travels south of the border to give talks.Just last week he addressed members of Achill Island Historical Society about Co Mayo Orangeism which \"went down really well\", and other trips this year have taken him to Mayo, Cork, Meath, Dublin, Donegal and Dun Laoghaire.He said: \"Almost universally I get a reception of immense interest and a positive line of questioning. \"The history aspect is very eclectic, % of people have no idea what Orangeism is about.\"The booklets have been translated by Irish language scholar and university professor Dr Ciaran OCoigligh.Mr Dougan explained: \"They should be and are of interest to anyone who has a true, agenda-free interest in discovering Irish history. \"The Irish language is a part of le for many people and this is an attempt to bring this subject matter to a new audience.\"However, Mr Dougan, who has worked as a columnist for the Orange Standard, the newspaper of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, said that while he respects the Irish language, he is not in favour of an Irish Language Act, because of his concerns over how it would be \"imposed\" by Sinn Fein.\"One of the most sensitive issues at the minute in unionist and loyalist communities is that of an Irish Language Act,\" he added. \"It isnt really about the language directly, it is that our experience of Sinn Fein just does not trust them not to exploit itthey were given legal cover to do so. \"I fully intend to address the audience at the launch.

to promote her new memoir, Dame Julie described being in hospital following the birth of her daughter and receiving a gruff phone call from Pamela Travers.“She said ‘Well talk to me’ and I said ‘I’m sorry I’ve just had a baby yesterday, I’m feeling a bit out of it’,” said Dame Julie.“She said ‘I understand you’re going to play Mary Poppins  You’re far too pretty of course, but you’ve got the nose for it’.”Singing with that glorious sound around you is almost more wondrous than anythingDame Julie AndrewsIt is one of hundreds of anecdotes the actress and author has from a career in showbusiness spanning almost  years.In conversation with actor Alex Jennings – who was recently directed by Dame Julie as Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady – she gave an insight into her path from musicals and vaudeville shows to the silver screen.Dame Julie grew up in Walton-on-Thames where her mother was a singer and pianist and her stepfather was a tenor.It was her stepfather who gave her singing lessons to keep her occupied when her school was closed during the war.“I hated the lessons but they discovered that I had this really freak, child prodigy voice and hit high notes and dogs would howl for miles around,” she said.Despite her talent, Dame Julie said at first she had not enjoyed learning to sing, saying: “The realisation that I could give the audience something didn’t come until much later.”She revealed it was comedienne Hetty Jaques who helped launch her career in America by advising the producers of Broadway musical The Boyfriend to go and see her in panto.She was subsequently offered a two-year contract in New York, which paved her way to Hollywood.Walt Disney himself asked her to play Mary Poppins, and she delighted the audience at the Southbank Centre by saying “supercalragilisticexpialidocious” backwards as she does in the film.She said one of her most star-struck moments came when Hollywood icon Bette Davis told her at the premiere of The Sound of Music

They called on their peers to jointhe programme.Bloc Blinds in Magherafelt is one of those companies. Mark Wilson, IT Director with the town centre business, said: “Since our establishment only eight years ago, Bloc Blinds has become a leading employer in Mid Ulster. Our technology underpins our success. We are pleased to be a founding member of this Career Encode initiative to develop and nurture the talent we need to continue to grow.”Alan Davis from Magherafelt, who secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with Bloc Blinds, praised the scheme.Hed said “I found Career Encode to be a better alternative to university as it gives the ability to learn and work in a real workplace.”FP McCann was another high profile company involved with the apprenticeship scheme.The Knockcloughrim-based companys IT Manager Brian Law said: “FP McCann is one of the largest employers in the mid Ulster region. Our bespoke IT infrastructure and software is critical to the sustainability of our enterprise.“We were so impressed with the high calibre of the applicants that we offered two apprenticeships as opposed to one. We are looking forward to continuing our investment in a skilled IT team with the Career Encode initiative and would strongly recommend it to any business that is experiencing dficulties in recruiting staff with technology skills.”Ronan Rafferty from Dungiven secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with FP McCann.Ronana said: “I was very interested in the ability to earn money whilst getting experience within the working environment.”Working in collaboration with Northern Regional College, the schemehas already appointed  newIT apprentices who will build careers within a rapidly growing sector, which, according to the Skills Barometer Report , compiled by Ulster University Economic Policy Centre, will grow by % over the next decade.With this in mind Career Encode is seeking more Northern Ireland businesses to sign up to the scheme to ensure the IT talent resource here is not outpaced by demand.Camilla Long, Director of Bespoke Communications, which specialises in training and leadership development, is acting as an independent facilitator for theexisting  employers on the scheme.She said: “One of the biggest hurdles for businesses today is sourcing staff, particularly IT staff. This scheme allows participating companies to take the IT skills gap into their own hands by developing a future workforce for their business.“We had a phenomenal response to the first initiative with  young people of exceptionally high standards vying for  apprenticeships. We anticipate that the demand for next year’s intake will be so much higher.“The benefits for participating companies are about much more than alleviating technology staffing needs. Being part of Career Encode sends out a message to the next generation that you provide a workplace with a positive working culture that nurtures long-term career goals all while allowing you to develop employees with the skillset that you need for your future.”For further information log ontowww.careerencode googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty Gallagher with friend Barry Smith after London marathon No closure Martin and Elizabeth were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

Seventeen Down senior titles have yielded no success at provincial or national level.Not many,any, would have tipped Magherafelt to claim John McLaughlin this year and even less will tip them to beat a Mickey Moran-minded Kilcoo.But Magherafelt are here on merit, they’ve held the underdog tag for all but one of their championship games this season.It appears that they thrive off, of it but, for selector Paul Quinn it has been one game at a time, one challenge before the other from the outset.“The target at the start of the year was to win the first round. Everything just snowballed from there.Whenever you get drawn against Coleraine in the first round you, don’t look much further than that. So, all of our energy went on trying to win and get over the line on that first game and everything has just snowballed after that.”If there was ever a worry of the Rossa men freezing on the big stage, any such thought was obliterated by a performance that both players and management alike have deemed as one of their best.“For a lot of the build-up we were just worried that the players might freeze bit, they didn’t and they actually produced what we have thought to be their best performance of the year.“That is something that is very satisfying for not only us as the management but, for the players too.“We’ve a good celebration but, we got back out to training on Thursday evening and we were back out yesterday morning .“There is just your usual knocks and niggles but we are hoping to have everyone back for next week but, aside from that we’ve a full bill of health.” googletag.cmd.push AmbushBut attentions have definitely turned back to football and their eyes are firmly set on ambushing the Magpies in the Marshes.“Attention has definitely turned back to football, lads were still going into primary schools and things there on Thursday and Friday and they’d a few similar events on Saturday but, that is something they are embracing and they’re enjoying it.“But, now they’re in an Ulster Championship, you never know when you’ll get the chance to represent your club in Ulster again,ever.“Derry clubs have a really proud tradition in this competition and that is something that we are hoping to carry that on.”Like almost the every round of the Derry championship, Magherafelt will go into this one as heavy underdogs with little or no expectation.For many, they will claim that Kilcoo’s season only begins at the provincial stage.“I was actually chatting to a lad about this the other day and he told me that home advantage is massive in the first round of Ulster.“We are away from home they’ve played in seven of the last eight Ulster’s, they’ve two Derry managers that will know us inside and out, the preparation for us we’ll be the same as the final, as will the build-up.“Neutrals will look at all the iables and they’ll will write us off but, we are not afraid going up here. Looking at it and the match-up we think that it will be a close game.“Like I said we are the Derry champions and we want to go on and represent Derry well.“We’ve gone into almost every game as underdogs and the only game with expectation on us was the Banagher semi-final and looking back at it, we didn’t get enough credit when you see how fiercely competitive it is in the championship.”“That point was hammered home to me when I was sitting watching Thomas Davis’ knock Kilmacud Crokes out of the Dublin championship on Saturday night.”Quinn himself has some familiarities with Kilcoo lads through his time managing Fulham Irish in London, a club now managed by none other than Tyrone’s Owen Mulligan.“If I needed to know what this meant Gaelic Football was all about in Kilcoo these four emphasised it.“They were fiercely strong and put in a serious sht, real serious natural talent and damn good footballers.“Through that friendship I have been going and watching Kilcoo in the Ulster Championship and they are a serious outfit and I’m sure they haven’t appointed men of the calibre of Mickey and Conleith to just win the Down title.“It’s a game that we are really looking forward to, it’s like a new competition for us and we will be looking to represent Derry well.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

There was controversy in the final seconds when Feargal Higgins looked to have grabbed victory for Dungiven. His kick, which appeared to curl inside the post, was ruled out. After the final whistle there were unsavoury scenes, lasting a minute, involving players and subs from both teams. Once order was restored, management and officials from both clubs entered discussions with referee Gavin Hegarty and a decision not to play extra-time was agreed. The game was played in incessant rain and both teams deserve credit for their endeavour over the hour. googletag.cmd.push Ballinascreen played with Reece McSorley as a sweeper. Dungiven counteracted by putting Odhraacuten McKeever on Noel Rafferty, leaving Sean McKeever free at the other end. Early points from Pauric McNicholl, Feargal and Cahir Higgins had Dungiven - to - ahead after seven minutes. A run from midfield by Marty Bradley split the Dungiven defence, before Jon Paul Devlin slotted ‘Screen’s first score of the game. When Conal Logan turned over possession in the face of Dungiven’s defensive wall, Sean McKeever broke at pace, leading to a second point for Cahir Higgins. An outside of the boot Niall Doyle point gave ‘Screen some brief respite but Fergal and Cahir Higgins, the latter from a free, opened a four point lead. Odhraacuten and Daire McKeever combined for Sean to come surge forward and open a - to - lead after  minutes. Just when they were threatening to fade out of the game, Ballinascreen found the net. Caoilte McAlinden had the bravery to flick over the final Dungiven defender and when he rushed on the loose ball, he had the composure to slot an inch-perfect shot across ‘keeper Hasson to the far corner of the net. Marty Bradley added a fisted point after a Ronan McKenna run from deep but it was Dungiven who finished stronger. Hasson’s short kick-out found Eoin McKeever, who built a move up the right wing before Daire slotted between the posts. Feargal Higgins passed to and took apass from Conor Kelly to kick between the posts, putting them - to - ahead at the break. The third quarter became a non-event, with a series of failed attacks as both teams carried possession into the tackle. In the rd minute Aaron McBride began a move up-field that led to Emmet Duggan being dragged to the ground by Sean McKeever. No card was brandished but when Devlin’s penalty hit the bar, he pounced on the rebound to level to force over the line and level the game. Darragh McGilligan began to come into the game and he began a move that led to a Conor Kelly score from the wing, after Cahir and Feargal Higgins both kept their composure. McGilligan doubled Dungiven’s lead but Michael O’Kane’s men played second fiddle for the rest of the game. With seven minutes to go, Cathal Donnelly turned over a move from the Dungiven defence before being dragged to the ground by Thomas McClarey but astonishingly no black card was shown, with Donnelly correctly later seeing black for a cynical foul. Devlin tapped over the free and with Ballinascreen in control, a draw looked a likely outcome. Goalkeeper Ryan Scullion scuffed a th shot to the left of the posts but made up for it with pressure kick in injury time to draw the game. Dungiven will have to plan without Conor Kelly for the replay, after he was dismissed on a straight red card, for an off the ball incident late in the game.

Quigg to the rescue for Kilrea Glen -Kilrea - There was also a stalemate in the other semi-final, when Paddy Quigg rescued Kilrea with a late free to draw with Glen in Loup. Three seasons ago, Kilrea went all the way to an Ulster Final at St Paul’s only to be beaten by Burren at St Paul’s. There was torrential rain from start to finish but Quigg opened the scoring with a goal after linking up with Daithi McLaughlin to beat ‘keeper Caolan Convery at the near post. It was point for point for the rest of the half. Quigg, Gearoid and Daithi McLaughlin were on target for the Pearses. Alex Doherty , Conleth McGuckin and Eunan Mulholland were the Glen scorers but they trailed - to - at the break. In horrendous conditions, the second-half, it took  minutes for first score of the half from Paddy Quigg. Glen got a penalty in the th minute and Alex Doherty converted to put them a point up and Quigg equalised from a free with the last kick.

The companies travelling from Derry and Strabane are O’Neill’s International Sportswear, Humanity Cosmetics, Learning Pool and Visual Edge while EKO Chute, MMG Welding and Wild Fuschia Bakery from Donegal will also be taking part. The trade and iInvestment mission will be led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Councils and will include third level and further education providers and development organisations including the Ulster University, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the North West Regional College, Donegal ETB and Catalyst. The mission will run from  to  November. It will build on the strong political, economic and cultural linkages already established in Boston and Philadelphia with the North West City region and will be an opportunity to further reach out to the Irish diaspora.  Speaking ahead of the visit and welcoming the confirmation of the seven local companies, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, said the visit was particularly timely for the companies and partners to promote the North West city region’s unique strategic cross border location. She said: “This trade mission is a real opportunity for us to focus on our strengths in terms of location, talent and skills and support. It is our chance to really sell our location to the business community in the US, by educating them to the fact that post Brexit they can locate in our region and access both the North of Ireland and the EU. We will be very positive in our approach to emphasise to potential investors the strong selling points we have in terms of our location, our talented skills base, our cultural compatibility and quality of le, During the visit the participating businesses will meet with key contacts, explore and understand opportunities in the US market, develop in-market networks and develop relationships with potential customers. The civic delegation will engage with industry influencers and leaders, meet with Philadelphia Council and attend a Philadelphia Diaspora event. While in Boston they will visit the Irish Immigration Centre, meet State representatives at the State House and attend the official launch of the Hard GSD Visit Atlas for a City Region project as well as engaging with senior business executives. In addition to attending bespoke business to business meetings and engaging with potential investors and business connections, the delegation will attend a reception hosted by the Irish Consulate in Boston and be guests at the Golden Bridges Conference. Last year, Joule, a locally based fire engineering consultancy business, was one of a number of companies that took part in the trade mission. The company’s founding director John McColgan said he trade visit was a fantastic opportunity to look at new markets in the United States and his company’s participation was a very positive experience. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

Conor Woods got Ballycran moving in the eighth minute with a converted free, but Dunloy responded with two-in-a-row from Elliott and Nicky McKeague to go four points clear.Liam Savage kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play, but a goal and a point from Cunning eased Dunloy into a - to - lead by the th minute.Woods and Cunning, via a rsquo, swapped points before Liam Savage grabbed his second score of the game in the th minute.Two further Ballycran points from Woods reduced the arrears to four points by the th minute, but Paul Shields and Chris Brogan stretched Dunloyrsquos lead to - to - after  minutes.Woods registered Ballycranrsquos seventh point in the th minute, but Dunloy finished the first half scoring with points from Shields and Cunning as the Antrim side went into the break with a commanding - to - lead.The scores should have been much closer as Ballycran registered six wides in a competitive first half.Woods opened the scoring after the break, but Ballycranrsquos uphill challenge got even harder when Gerard Hughes was given a straight red card, forcing the peninsula side to play the remainder of the game with  men.Cunning and Woods exchanged points before Ryan McGarry, Elliottand Molloy helped Dunloy storm into a - to - lead midway through the second half.A point from Liam Savage slowed Dunloy up for a while, but they quickly regained the initiative and points from Elliott, Eamon Smyth, Cunning and McKeague had the Cuchullains - to - ahead with six minutes remaining.Woods scored a late point for Ballycran, but it was quickly cancelled out by points from Molloy and McKeague and a goal at the death from Anton McGrath to put the game to bed.Ballycran: Stephen Keith, Michael Hughes, Sean Ennis, Gerard Hughes, Brett Nicholson, Padraig Flynn, Patrick Hughes, Liam Savage , Phelim Savage, Scott Nicholson, Conor Woods , Michael Ennis, Stuart Martin, Colum McManus, Chris Egan.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn. Also Lady Pym who was representing the local senior citizensrsquo Friendship Club.BALLYGALGET mdash A request from the school management committee of St Patrickrsquos Primary School at Ballygalget to provide transport for  pupils has been turned down by the local Education Board.The school management committee had explained to the Board that the  infants end their school day officially at .pm, but there is no transport to take them home until .pm.The school committee requested action because there was no teacher available to supervise the infants who had to remain in the school building.The transport officer of the Board, Mr Milligan, stressed that seven of the children were below compulsory school attendance age and as such were not eligible for school transport.Outlining the background to transport facilities provided at the school, Mr Milligan pointed out that an Ulsterbus had carried the children to and from the school for over  years.It had not generally been the practice of the Board to provide buses to take the children home before the end of the normal school day and there were no Board vehicles free to provide transport.Despite a y debate, the Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee said they could not suggest a solution to the problem.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick priest Dr Joseph Maguire has been re-elected chairman of the finance committee of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Maguire told members of the committee that he considered it an hour to be re-elected and he promised to serve the interests of the committee and the Board in every way that he could.COMBER mdash Proposals by Comber traders to prevent moves which they say could threaten their businesses, may well be turned down.The threat is in the shape of the Department of Environment who have announced that they intend introducing parking restrictions in the main shopping areas of the town.The confrontation between the Department and Comber Traders Association has been long running, but on Thursday it seemed that a solution could be found.The Traders Association had an on-the-spot meeting on Thursday morning with a representative from the Roads Division, who listened to the tradersrsquo complaints and suggestions for the siting of the yellow lines in the town. Also present was a representative from the RUC traffic branch.However, there are fears that the tradersrsquo suggestions will be dismissed and the Department will push ahead with their proposals to restrict parking in Comber.The Traders Association feel that the proposals are a very real threat to their livelihood and are inconvenient mdash a view shared by many residents in the town who have backed the Association in their fight with the Department..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Greenkeeper.jpg","title":"Greenkeeper gets revenge at sunny Spa  ","story":"SPA golfers faced a novel end-of-season challenge on Saturday when head groundsman Lee Cartmill set up the -hole course for his Greenkeeperrsquos Revenge competition.It was essentially a fun event which attracted a large number of both ladies and gents and proved to be so popular it is likely to feature again on the Spa calendar.But the devilishly dficult pin placings did not deter Alan Carson who topped the leaderboard with a magnicent score of  points while Catherine McEvoy won the ladies -hole competition with  points.Spa PGA professional Gary Wardlow warned competitors that the pins were in ldquorather unusual positions but after a number of impressive scores were ed he reckoned it had not been sufficiently challenging.Stuart Alexander had his best start for many months with eight straight pars followed by a birdie at the par four th, but unfortunately his great run did not continue.At least two other competitors mdash Sam Boyd and William McAnally mdash also had birdies at the th where the pin was placed in the left-hand green side bunker.Menrsquos results: st Alan Carson , nd George Wilson , rd Chris Chittick , th Stephen Adams , th Brian Graham .Ladiesrsquo results: st Catherine McEvoy , nd Vivienne Abernethy , rd Carol Shields ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Hat-trick.jpg","title":"Hat trick of titles  ","story":"IT was a case of trebles all round recently for a highly-talented teenager from Kilmore.Eighteen year-old Conor Mullan, a son of well-known Crossgar garage owner James Mullan, was in seventh heaven after adding the Ulstermotocross semi-expert title to the Irish and Ulster Youth crowns won earlier in the the year.Conor blazed his way to victory in all three competitions and crowned a sensational year at Desertmartin last week when he clinched the Ulster title, despite riding with a few niggling injuries, including a troublesome shoulder.To clinch Ulster and Irish titles in the same year is some achievement and Conor has done it in style.The Year  pupil at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, now has his focus on sitting his A-Levels next year ldquoI am in Upper Sixth at the minute, taking A-Levels in geography, technology and business studies, he said.ldquoNext year the plan is to go to university, where Irsquod like to study business, or economics.

Together, we want to deliver inclusive, transformative regional regeneration, strengthen our economy and boost our prosperity.Ambitious plans to revolutionise tourist facilities in Newcastle are part of the City Deal proposals and are making signicant progress.Ground condition survey work is taking place in the resort at the base of the Mournes where a new a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains would be based, with the local council confirming that it is planning to appoint a dedicated team to deliver an outline business case designed to pave the way to secure funding to help build the project.An economist is also to be appointed to help with the delivery of the business case which is expected to be completed in early spring or summer.The Gateway proposal is one of the key projects included in the local councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.The world class tourist attraction proposals include the gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain with the proposals expected to be delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.Council officials are also working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the ious projects through a series of key

that a le-extending drug will be made available free for their young son who has cystic fibrosis.Jen Banks and her husband Dermot were told yesterday by the Department of Health that Northern Ireland would follow the lead by NHS England and make Cystic Fibrosisdrugs Orkbambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco available to eligible patients.It is hoped that their two year-old son, Lorcaacuten, and other CF sufferers will be offered the drugs within weeks.The initial cost of a yearrsquos supply of the drug was estimated at pound, per patient.Last night Jen told the Recorder that she and her husband were ldquoecstatic but the news still has sunk in after they were called to a meeting with Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly at Stormont.The surprise announcement came as the couple were preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos hands within  days, starting rightly so, with those most in need.The mother of two admitted that living with Lorcaacutenrsquos condition and knowing that there was a drug that could dramatically improve his quality of le was ldquoabsolutely horrendous.ldquoIn many ways we feel that Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy has been stolen from us, Jen said of her first child who was diagnosed at  days old.ldquoThe torture wasnrsquot that he had CF, it was that there was something that could help him but there was a company out there that was pricing the drug so highly, it was unobtainable.Jen believes that Lorcaacuten will be on the drug before Christmas and recognises this as a gt of le.ldquoItrsquos not that this is just a good Christmas present but that we have actually been given extra Christmases with our son, said Jen.ldquoOne of the models for the drugs suggest thatyou start it at age six, you can have an extra  years on top of the normal le expectancy for a CF sufferer. ldquoItrsquos like we have been given  Christmases with Lorcaacuten, that it what it really means to us.Lorcaacuten currently needs two sessions of physio each day and uses a nebuliser five times a day along with  tables to absorb fat from his food.He has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last Christmas.Jen said: ldquoHopefully, by taking the drugs, it will mean that will be the end of the infection and he wonrsquot get other infections.ldquoIt gives us even more time to keep him healthy until the better drugs come along.The  year-old has been one of the most vocerous campaigners to have the drug make available in Northern Ireland.She and her husband planned over the summer to move to Louth as the drug is free to patients in the Republic of Ireland but the sale fell through.The mother of two also vowed this week ldquochain herself to the railings at Stormontthe Department of Health did bring the drugs to Northern Ireland.Jen also praised the Recorder for its ldquocontinued and compassionate support of her familyrsquos storyldquoAll of the coverage made us feel that people really cared and we canrsquot thank the paper enough for its support, added

true for singer Mark McMullan, who has just landed himself the lead role in a major touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Mark will follow in the footsteps of Jason Donovan and Philip Schofield who played Joseph when he takes to the stage in Doncaster for a five-month tour from December .The role is Markrsquos first major performance in a national stage musical and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of . Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything. Declan, of course, wanted to tell the world but we didnrsquot want to say until Mark knew for definite it was  per cent.ldquoWe are hoping to travel over for his first show as this will be a great stepping stone for him.While the opportunity may have alluded the talented  year-old until now, Mark said he is ready for the challenge.ldquoIrsquom not nervous about performing as Irsquom definitely ready for this but Irsquom a bit nervous about the other performers who have played the role and feel an obligation to be good and do everyone proud.Mark has already appeared in a youth production of Joseph as the Pharaoh, having performed with St Patrickrsquos Choral Society from the age of  to .He said that while he grew up in a musical family, it was his grandfather, Seamus Mullan, and mother, Brenda, who really encouraged him.ldquoI knew I could sing from an early age as Irsquom from a musical family, said Mark. ldquoBut it wasnrsquot really until I joined the choral society and sang publicly for the first time a few months later in Calamity Jane that people began to tell me I was really good.ldquoPeople told me that I could make a career of singing and it began to occur to me that maybe I could do this.ldquoMy granda was a member of St Patrickrsquos Choral Society and sang in the choir of Mary Mother of the Church in Saintfield. The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager. I speak every night to my Mum and him and he wants to know everything.Mark will continue with his job as architect while living in Newcastle-upon-Tyne with his partner, Zoe Hunter, who he met while they were students at Down High, until he feels confident that a secure future lies ahead of him in musical theatre.ldquoIrsquom also doing a Masters degree in architecture so between work, studying and rehearsal, le is very busy at the moment, he added.Bill Kenwrightrsquos production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webberrsquos musical will play in Doncaster from December  to January  before continuing its UK tour in Peterborough, Aylesbury, Wimbledon, Coventry, Bradford, Chesterfield and Sunderland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting on bypass plans  ","story":"ROADS issues topped the agenda during a meeting in Downpatrick last week including progress on the multi-million pound Ballynahinch bypass scheme.South Down MP Chris Hazzard led a Sinn Fein delegation which met with senior Department of Infrastructure officials at Rathkeltair House.The MP was joined by South Down MLAs Emma Rogan and Sinead Ennis and councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Cathy Mason and Willie Clarke.Mr Hazzard said roads officials provided the delegation with a detailed overview of the local situation, including the impact of successive government austerity budgets on the departmentrsquos ability to maintain the network, invest in much-needed new public transport infrastructure and deliver the appropriate winter service in the months ahead.The MP said that despite the dficult operational environment, it was pleasing to hear that the roads department is continuing to deliver much-needed improvements, including progressing with the final legal stages of the Ballynahinch bypass.It was also confirmed that work is continuing on congestion alleviation schemes in Downpatrick and much-needed road safety enhancements in Mayobridge.ldquoWe also discussed the imminent public inquiry of the vitally important A junctions scheme, perhaps the highest priority local roads scheme given the huge road safety advantages that scheme is likely to deliver and the Newry southern relief road, said the MP.ldquoI was also pleased to hear roads officials speak passionately about delivering a number of park and ride facilities that will help meet the growing demand for modern, fit-for-purpose public transport options in the local area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Niall.jpg","title":"Niall backs start up loans plan  ","story":"THE founder of a Castlewellan business which makes an intelligent outdoor storage solution has been chosen to champion UK start-ups by the government-backed Start-Up Loans programme.Niall Greenan from The Smart Bunker was one of  business founders honoured at a reception at Westminster last week to celebrate some of the UKrsquos most successful small businesses.The Smart Bunker is an easy-to-use dispensing system which releases coal with a simple pull of a lever to fill the bucket to the required amount that can be carried.Mr Greenan , came up with the idea when he realised how dficult it was for his mother, who has arthritis, to fill a coal bucket from her traditional coal bin.He used a pound, Start-Up Loan to develop the device, which has gone on to win several awards.Mr Greenan has also expanded The Smart Bunker to include safe storage of wood pellets, ice treatment and animal feed.The product has attracted attention for its sustainability credentials, providing a good alternative to the plastic bags usually usedfor agricultural storage.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things.

With that close to being achieved we want to emphasise that we never sought an Irish Sea border and we want to see Stormont . ‘To that end, we now accept that in a system of mandatory coalition no one party should set red lines before theof devolution. ‘We realise that previous comments by the Tanaiste suggested that we think an Irish language act is needed for Stormont to .‘As a Brexit resolution nears, we can see things more calmly, and now concede that any Irish government would be outragedunionists collapsed power-sharing and issued terms for its . So we will now support the UK restoring Stormont without preconditions’OK, so the chance that Mr Varadkar will say that is almost zero.But is there anyone in Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs, which has sway over this province, or in Dublin’s political establishment, who can see how much anger would be alleviated by such a statement To grasp unionist frustration, go back to David Trimble’s  plea to Sinn Fein, the year after the Belfast Agreement: ‘Mr Adams, it’s over to you. We’ve jumped you follow.’The Ulster Unionist leader was endorsing setting up power-sharing with SF ahead of IRA decommissioning, hoping that the latter would follow .Ian Ellis: Ending welfare mitigation payments could mean , households in Northern Ireland will see their incomes fall suddenly Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Remember also how in  direct rule was imposed by London after IRA spying at Stormont and the Castlereagh break-in , because Tony Blair refused specic sanction against SF.Recall March  after the Northern Bank robbery and the murder of Robert McCartney, when all Northern Ireland politicians were dis-invited to the White House on St Patrick’s Day, instead of just republican ones.Go forward to autumn , after the murder of Kevin McGuigan, and security force assessments of an intact Provisional IRA structure.The DUP would have been justied in refusing to continue to share power with republicans then but would not have dared, knowing that global opprobrium would follow.A widespread sense within unionism that republicans are allowed to do things that unionists are never allowed to do is why even many moderate pro Union voters want Nigel Dodds to defeat Sinn Fein.When Martin McGuinness wrote a letter explaining SF’s decision to collapse Stormont in January , disrespect to Irish culture was mentioned in passing, but his big complaint was Arlene Foster refusing to stand aside over RHI.This newspaper long ago made an editorial decision that the cash for ash scandal was worthy of daily scrutiny, via Sam McBride’s excellent coverage. We saw off critics who said a unionist paper was making things hard for unionists.But RHI was never a reason to collapse power-sharing, particularly after a public inquiry was agreed.It soon emerged that Sinn Fein’s enduring red line towas an Irish language act . Sure enough, hospitals and schools have been rudderless for three years and will remain so until such legislation is in place. The DUP agreed an ILA in February , but was unable to sell it to unionists.Many people sombrely say that all MLAs need a pay cut but get confused as to the source of the stalemate. All parties, goes the criticism, must “drop their red lines”, asunionists saying no to ILA blackmail is equivalent to the demand itself.If anyone is still under this misapprehension, consider it like this: Think of an imaginary ided society in which the political aspirations of that society can be scaled from  to , with  the status quo.Side A would like society to move to point  in the scale, while Side B would like it to be at point .But they agree to disagree, and stay at the compromise of point .Side A then says, right, we’re unilaterally moving the status quo to , but Side B says, no you’re not.Side A has issued a non negotiable red line demand. Side B has resisted that non negotiable demand.It is not the same thing.For both sides to be equally culpable, Side B would have had to say: we are unilaterally insisting that the status quo moves to .But it has not done that.Some people will be outraged at a journalist writing an article such as this against an ILA. Yet I see no criticism, or even concern, at the way that the media class has accepted there has to be an ILA, despite the fact that Irish already enjoys positive discrimination such as Irish language schools with far lower pupil numbers than larger schools that have to close.A respected commentator wrote recently that an ILA was viewed as “pivotal” to Stormont’s . It is often said that an ILA is harmless, yet even last year’s watered down proposal included a language commissioner. AsNI needs another commissioner!Does anyone think that, evenIrish is visible everywhere, such a person will be issuing reports five years from now, or , saying all is well with language provision  Or that such reports won’t be seized on to justy legal actions for even more widespread use of Irish Isolated Protestants in the west of NI believe some councils are being triumphalist when they use Irish as the first language in signage, despite the fact it is spoken well by a tiny minority of NI’s population. It is often said that Protestants should appreciate Irish as part of their heritage, but the fact is that many unionists are uncomfortable with how they perceive it is used. Similarly there are aspects of unionist culture with which many Catholics are uncomfortable, and there would be unremitting uproarunionists demanded protection for such culture before Stormont could sit.Sinn Fein had ample time after  to reassure people as to its intentions. Instead it used an ILA in a way that fanned fears. If Stormont s on the basis of ILA, it is a precedent for a future collapse based on fresh demands. If it is restored without pre-conditions, MLAs can debate the merits and de-merits of such legislation without the lasting rancour there will bean ILA has been achieved by ransom.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Festival provides November tourism boost to NI seaside townsA festival which has proven to be a boost to off-season tourism in the towns of Portrush and Portstewart is to celebrate the work of one of the area#s greatest musical sons.

Among those signing the letter were PUP leader Billy Hutchinson and DUP councillor Dean McCullough, although the fact he is a DUP politician was not mentioned and he was instead described as chairman of Rathcoole Neighbourhood Renewal, a publicly-funded cross-party group involving everyone from Sinn Féin to the UUP.Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve Aiken Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Agnew said it was “naive” of Mr Aiken to pledge to stand in all  seats and said of the incoming leader: “He’s only been in the party a handful of years”.The veteran unionist said he feared that “the party is slowly leaving me at the moment”.It is understood that senior UUP figures are meeting this weekend to decide on whether to back Mr Aiken’s stance or agree a pact with the DUP.Mr Dodds’ seat is the most vulnerablethe UUP does not agree a pact. Although the DUP’s deputy leader is widely respected at Westminster and is one of the DUP’s most capable figures, his majority has been shrinking in North Belfast as demographic changes, a shrinking unionist vote and a consolidation of the nationalist vote behind Sinn Fein has left him with a majority of just over ,.He is facing a challenge from the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Belfast, John Finucane, who is being positioned as a more moderate and modern republican than past candidates such as former IRA bomber Gerry Kelly.In a statement last night, Mr Dodds said that it was “essential that there is respect on all sides for the democratic process”.The former Stormont Finance Minister said: “There have been some reports of intimidation and threats issued towards members and activists from the UUP.“Any such incidents are deplorable and must be totally condemned. The only appropriate way to express your views and the most effective way to send a message in our society is through the ballot box.“For our part the DUP has a positive plan for Northern Ireland to deliver more for everyone building on the extra billions of investment we have already delivered in the past two years for health and education, roads and broadband.“We will be putting forward that clear message over the coming weeks.”At the time of going to press, the PSNI had not responded to a request for comment.The PSNI’s Belfast District Commander, Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts, said: “Police received a report yesterday morningabout telephone calls received by staff in an office in the Belmont Road area of east Belfast.“Some of these calls have been described as abusive and threatening in nature. “Enquiries are ongoing.”Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve Aiken©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"sam mcbride u turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for steve aiken  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve AikenIncoming Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken floundered in an interview on The ViewSam McBrideEmail Published::Saturday  November Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Sign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Politics\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”\u2028There was an immediate and predictable backlash from the DUP, whose deputy leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds would be most vulnerablethe UUP was to contest every seat.Arlene Foster accused him of doing something which would “hand seats to Sinn Féin”.Mr Aiken was clear and unapologetic about his stance evenit meant Mr Dodds losing his seat. He told the News Letter that the DUP has been undermining the Union and therefore it was natural that his party would not stand aside in favour of such a party.PSNI called in as UDA tells UUP to step aside Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said that “the DUP, the supposed supporters of the Union, have been one of the biggest detractors from it”.Pressure came on Mr Aiken from ious sources – including one sitting UUP councillor, Frazer Agnew – and the Grand Master of the Orange Order in Belfast, Spencer Beattie, to reverse his position.However, while privately there was unhappiness within sections of the UUP, the party’s small band of big beasts were publicly restrained about expressing their unease.But, appearing on The View on Thursday night, Mr Aiken came unstuck. Although it was obvious that the pressure for a pact would be the main line of questioning, the incoming UUP leader appeared unclear about his policy.Initially said “we’re committed to running candidates everywhere”.But within moments, when pressed by presenter Mark Carruthers, he was refusing to say whether that would mean standing in all  seats.In an interview which at points defied logical analysis, Mr Aiken suggested that he had been surprised at Sinn Féin’s century-old policy of abstentionism.When asked to explain why he had changed his stance on North Belfast, he said: “One of the things that has changed, of course, is that yesterday Sinn Féin have decided to put forward a candidate who’s not even going to stand in Westminster.”In passing, later in the interview, he said that there had been threats made to UUP staff, but he did not indicate that his apparent change of position was based on that development.There are UUP members unhappy at the position articulated by Mr Aiken. But they have little reason for complaint in that he is being handed the leadership of their party without a contest and any one of them could have challenged him for the post.Although Mr Aiken is a former commander of a Royal Navy nuclear submarine, he is still new to politics, having first been elected to any political post when he entered the Assembly as an MLA just three-and-a-half years ago.However, the South Antrim MLA has always been clear that he is on the liberal wing of the party.The UUP knew that when not a single other party member put their name forward to be leader. Yet some of those people who chose not to contest the leadership appear shocked that a liberal unionist has said something which is consistent with his ideology.In remarkable circumstances, Mr Aiken now faces what may be the defining moment for his leadership – before he has even taken over as leader.If Mr Aiken presses ahead with standing in every constituency, he can expect to face the wrath of many unionists – including the Orange Order, members of his own party and UUP voters.However,  he reverses a policy which he set out with such conviction and instead adopts a position with which he does not agree, Mr Aiken will not only appear weak, but also incompetent.Over recent years, several senior DUP figures have privately said that they believe there is a need for a distinctively liberal unionist party – a recognition that the DUP, no matter how successful, will never be able to mop up all of the votes lost by the UUP, and something they believe would free the DUP to pursue policies without fear of being outflanked by the UUP from both left and right.Yetit is ultimately in unionism’s – and even the DUP’s – interest to have such a party, the DUP’s actions have undermined that, by robustly denouncing UUP leaders, and the short-lived NI, who have struck out in a liberal direction.Within the DUP, there are people who realise that whereas in days gone past there was an expectation from both the UUP and DUP that anyone who was pro-Union would vote for a unionist regardless of their other policies, the world is changing.Young people in particular are more enthused by issues – anything from environmentalism to gay rights to the question of abortion – than by party or constitutional politics.The idea that a gay unionist who is pro-choice, anti-Brexit and believes that the world is facing a climate emergency should automatically vote for a DUP candidate simply because they are unionist is as out of date as the idea that an opponent of same-sex marriage who is pro-le, pro-Brexit and opposes green taxes should vote for a UUP candidate simply because they are a unionist.Part of the explanation for the growth of the Alliance and Green Party vote in recent elections is that some voters who are constitutionally unionist – in that they would vote for the Union in any border poll – have felt disrespected by the mindset behind pacts which is implicitly that they should simply do their duty and vote for whoever their political leaders have decided is ‘their’ candidate.There is therefore a strategic logic to Mr Aiken’s attempt to dferentiate the UUP from its larger rival evenin the short term it costs unionism in a marginal seat.But by appearing unprepared to face down what was always going to be vocal – and heartfelt – opposition to anything which could see Sinn Féin benefit, he has undermined his leadership before it has even begun.try catch  TrendingCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashTeenager killed in NI road traffic collision -

I was shocked by his deliberate isive rhetoric that is stoking anger.Even his own MPs were shocked at his attempt to claim the memory of Jo Cox in support for his demand to leave by October  regardless of the consequences.Describing death threats to MPs as humbug was a new low.Wersquore roughly a month away from potentially crashing out of the EU with no deal on October  and wersquore none the wiser as to how Boris Johnson plans to answer some of the major issues we face.The Prime Minister and his Brexit extremists donrsquot care the damaging impact that a no deal exit would have on our people, on jobs and public services.I have been very clear and consistent about the damage that a no deal Brexit would do.Letrsquos not forget, the people of Cardf South and Penarth voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the  EU Referendum.I will continue to work within my party and across political parties to ensure we arenrsquot dragged out of the EU without a deal against our will.Each day I meet with doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients who are genuinely concerned about the impact of a no deal Brexit on our NHS.Earlier this week I updated the Senedd on how health and social care across Wales are preparing for a no deal Brexit.I agreed to spend poundm of NHS Wales funds to purchase and stockpile essential medical supplies and equipment.To give some context, that poundm could have paid for seven replacement MRI scanners instead.I cannot overstate how much of my time has been taken up on no deal preparation.There is a huge amount of time energy and effort being spent on preparing for the worst possible outcome for our country.That is time energy and effort that should be going into improving health and care services for our staff and the people that they serve.This is not what the people voted for.We have to be honest with ourselves and the public - there is no easy answer to the Brexit farce.That includes my preferred answer of referendum, remain and reform of the EU.The recently announced plan by the Prime Minister to have customs checks in Ireland is a real threat to peace and security.That is not normal.The customs checks that would slow down goods including food and medicines are not normal.The prospect of a Prime Minister breaking the law ndash again ndash at the end of this month to deliver no deal is far from normal.I know any people are tired of Brexit but this is the biggest issue of our generation.Unless we put it back to the people in a referendum then I do not believe we will ever resolve our future within Europe and the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
