He also urged YSK members to \u0027do your job the right way\u0027, adding he believed the results would be \u0027very good\u0027.Opposition parties and NGOs deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to ward against fraud. They have said election law changes and fraud allegations in the 2017 referendum raise fears about the vote\u0027s fairness.Earlier, CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said the party had reported to the YSK allegations of block votes being cast and of election monitors being beaten and kept out of polling stations in the southeast\u0027s Sanliurfa province.YSK chairman Sadi Guven told the state-owned news agency Anadolu it was taking steps in response to reports of irregularities in the town of Suruc near the Syrian border.The government gave no immediate response to the reports, but Erdogan said there had not been any serious problems.           Earlier today opposition party member Mehmet Sıddık Durmaz (pictured) was reportedly shot dead \u0027during the voting process\u0027, local media said          A woman waits to vote at a polling station in snap twin Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections in Istanbul today          Turks went to the polls this morning in presidential and parliamentary elections that pose the biggest ballot box challenge to Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power over 15 years ago          Chairman of the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu arrive to cast their ballot at a polling station during the parliamentary and presidential elections, in AnkaraTurkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with decrees - for nearly two years since an attempted coup in 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on his followers in Turkey, detaining some 160,000 people, according to the United Nations.The president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. \u0027This is no longer a Turkey we want.

Erdogan has filed close to 2,000 lawsuits against people, including school children, for insulting him.       Hundreds of thousand of supporters of Muharrem Ince, the main presidential candidate facing Erdogan, gather in Istanbul yesterday          Recep Tayyip Erdogan held his own rally for the AK Party in the Esenyurt district of Istanbul yesterday          Erdogan at a rally of his own supporters this week in the city of Kahramanmaras on Thursday.

Friends of the Defence Secretary said he was right to go into battle for funding for the military, which has been hit by heavy cuts in recent years.One senior Tory said that as many as 50 Tory MPs were so exercised over the issue that they could vote to block the Budget this autumn unless Mrs May and Chancellor Philip Hammond open the purse strings.‘There are 50 MPs who are willing to throw themselves under a bus over this,’ the source said.‘These are people who understand defence and understand that we need to be investing more if we are going to maintain our status as a major defence power.‘The Budget is one of the few real levers that people have got –everyone understands that.’Give me £20billion or I\u0027ll bring you down: Defence...Philip Hammond paves the way for tax hikes as he warns he...Core of Grenfell cladding panels burned as hot as flaming...Share this articleAnother said: ‘The big story here is that there is a significant group of Tory MPs who feel passionately about this and who are prepared to back that up with action.‘Gavin is a former chief whip – he understands the numbers and the implications for the Government’s majority.’ Mrs May is said to have caused a ‘shockwave’ last week by questioning the UK’s status as a ‘tier one’ military power in a meeting with Mr Williamson, chief of the defence staff General Sir Nick Carter and Mr Hammond.The UK is one of a handful of tier one powers along with the United States, Russia, France and China.Membership of the club requires ‘full spectrum’ capabilities, including a nuclear deterrent, combat jets, a navy capable of deployment anywhere in the world, intelligence-led counter terrorism forces, cyber defences and a deployable army ision capable of engaging in a land war.Mrs May ducked a direct question about the UK’s tier one status last week, but insisted: ‘We are a leading defence nation and that will continue.’In the coming weeks, she will face fresh calls to loosen the purse strings when she is briefed on backbench concerns by a powerful delegation comprising defence committee chairman Julian Lewis, foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat and Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories.Dr Lewis last night warned that Mrs May could not afford to ignore backbench opinion on the issue. ‘There need be no political risk to the Prime Minister – if she does the right thing,’ he said.‘I’ve been in parliament for 20 years and I’ve never known such unanimity. If the NHS can get an extra £20billion a year, then defence surely deserves one tenth of that just to stand still.’But other Tory MPs believe Mr Williamson is stoking the row about defence spending to boost his standing in a future Tory leadership race.In a thinly-veiled swipe, which was also directed in part at Boris Johnson, former minister Nick Boles said: ‘Would it be too much to ask that senior members of the Cabinet behave like grown-ups, discuss serious issues in a serious way, and avoid running to the papers with childish threats?’Another MP said Mr Williamson was at risk of over-playing his hand. ‘There are many who are huge defenders of the military and have been working hard to make the case to protect the deployable capability that keeps us a tier one nation,’ the MP said. ‘But there’s no way we’d break cover now to back this weaselly attack on the PM. Williamson’s intemperate and frankly bizarre media posturing shows just how unsuited he is for any high office whatsoever.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/08/2B86864F00000578-0-image-m-5_1529826539092.jpg","title":"Ban pupils mobile phones says Brighton College headmaster Richard Cairns","story":"    Mr Cairns says his pupils found it \u0027liberating\u0027 to switch off their phonesLook around the school where I work, and at lunchtimes these days you will see groups of pupils huddled together in intense concentration.You might imagine they’re poring over the tiny screens of their mobile phones, giggling at some YouTube video or app. But no, they are actually battling over a game of Cluedo or Monopoly, seeking the bragging rights of having outwitted their classmates.In our sometimes bewildering age of technological sophistication, such traditional games might seem but a quaint throwback for a generation who’ve grown up with computers, tablets and mobile phones.Yet one of my more gratifying experiences has been to witness their miraculous revival among the pupils of Brighton College, a mixed independent school where I am the Head Master.To the surprise of many of them, they’ve become completely absorbed in the intrigue and strategy of games such as Cluedo, Monopoly and Risk, which are teaching them to celebrate their triumphs and accept their setbacks.So why are they playing them at all? Because, back in September, I decided to bring in severe restrictions on the use of mobile phones at school. And the results have been little short of revelatory.With screen and apps no longer so dominant on the premises, the attention of the pupils has turned elsewhere — and some of it has focused on those board games.Of course, we knew there would be a void to fill in the absence of mobiles, so we invested in a formidable stock of age-old games such as Scrabble, which not only engage the brain far more aggressively than addictive computer video games such as Candy Crush, but, just as importantly, promote social interaction. What the experiment has taught me and the pupils is just how much of a hold smartphones have over society — and just how liberating it can be to switch them off.What’s remarkable is how the benefits of the mobile phone ban can be seen in so many ways within the school.There is more interest in sport and drama, less in social media and selfies. It is infinitely preferable to see a 12-year-old with a cricket bat in his hand than a mobile phone.Pupils are also finding they enjoy actual conversations in the real world, instead of being hooked on superficial exchanges in the virtual one.Take away the phones and you take away the negative reason for pupils not to talk to each other. Just as pleasingly, we have seen an increase in reading. The school librarian has told me that the number of books being taken out by pupils has risen sharply since the ban was introduced.I don’t want to sound authoritarian or anti-technology. The mobile phone is one of the great innovations in mankind’s physical progress, transforming communications, commerce and entertainment.But, like all inventions, its use has to be handled responsibly. And in schools, there can be a significant downside to unrestricted access to mobiles.Fears state students could be \u0027shut out of top universities\u0027...JAN MOIR: Why we must ban phones in school now...whatever...Mobile phone entrepreneur John Caudwell in Lyme disease...Share this articleHaving one to hand makes it harder to concentrate, and harder to sleep well, too. Mental health can be undermined by the relentless pressure of social media, reflected in the neurotic obsession with not missing any tweet or text, no matter how trivial.One American study found that 50 per cent of children say they are addicted to their phones, while 80 per cent admit they check their devices at least every hour.Then there’s the darker side: the mobile phone can be an instrument for both bullying and classroom disruption.Although poor behaviour is not a problem at Brighton, I have been told by teachers elsewhere about the difficulties of maintaining order in classrooms where phones are allowed, especially when pupils actually film lessons or take photos of the teacher.           Brighton College, where head teacher Richard Cairns says the phone ban has been a massive successThe tolerance of such conduct is a recipe for a disastrous breakdown in respect for staff.Gratifyingly, several leading figures in politics and education are now aware of the harm that can be caused to youngsters by mobile phones.Last week, Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, urged schools to ban them on the grounds that they fuel bullying and distract from learning.‘I believe young children don’t need access to social media. They are children, after all. They need to be able to develop their social skills in the real world first,’ Hancock rightly said in a speech to the NSPCC.His call was echoed by Amanda Spielman, the Head of Ofsted, who argued that ‘technology has made the challenge of low-level disruption even worse’, and she supported a mobile ban in schools.If Brighton’s experience is anything to go by, such an approach will be a success.There is nothing cruel or unjust about such toughness. On the contrary, it is more compassionate because it gives pupils the space to learn and grow.Under our policy, day pupils in years seven, eight and nine — that is approximately from ages 11 to 14 — are required to hand in their mobiles to teachers at the beginning of the day. They then collect their phones when they go home, between 4pm or 5pm.Boarders, who make up about 40 per cent of the school roll, are required to follow the same restrictions in these years. In addition, they must hand back their phones at bedtime.Older pupils have fewer restrictions, but those in Year 10 still have to subscribe to three days of ‘detox’ without phones, while those in the year above have one ‘detox’ day.When I first brought in the policy, I was told it would not work. I was warned the pupils would ‘kick off’ because they are so hooked on their mobiles.But nothing of the sort happened. In fact, our pupils welcomed the change because it relieved them of the burden of being online the whole time.They found they had more freedom, more time for contemplation. ‘We don’t miss our phones at all,’ a group of Year 9 pupils told me.The process of learning has been enhanced, which is what other research has discovered. A 2015 study by the London School of Economics found banning phones raised pupils’ test scores by 6.4 per cent.And it’s not just better for their work. Boarders have also experienced better sleep without the online frenzy before they go to bed, a vital factor when young people’s brains are still developing.Crucially, it’s also easier for teachers to spot bullying of pupils, or pupils who are feeling isolated: so much online intimidation and taunting — so bad for teenagers’ mental health — is hidden by cyberspace. All in all, the experiment has been so successful that next year the school is to extend the five-day mobile ban to Year 10 pupils.I believe that one compelling reason why the pupils may have accepted the ban so readily is because today’s pupils are generally conservative with a small ‘c’ — fully focused on making a success of their time at school and happy to be relieved of any obstructions to achieving that success.Every generation rebels against its predecessor, and this one’s rebellion is to be more serious, dedicated and responsible. That is why they work harder, drink far less, take fewer drugs, have greater social awareness and are more orientated towards their careers.That’s why they have accepted the phone ban with good grace, and I only hope other schools across the country have the same idea.The fact is, the pupils will realise how good it is for them only once their smartphones have been put away. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/08/4D9B1EB500000578-5881919-image-m-15_1529913539536.jpg","title":"BBC presenter accidentally brands Health Secretary Jeremy C","story":"    The blunder came as Justin Webb read out a newspaper story about Jeremy Hunt (pictured on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show yesterday)          Webb claimed he had \u0027swerved\u0027 the verbal slip, but listeners were in no doubt about what they had heardCannabis on the NHS for children \u0027by 2019\u0027: Astonishing...Share this articleWebb tried to head off the inevitable mockery by claiming he had \u0027swerved\u0027 away from pronouncing the full four-letter word.However, listeners were convinced they had heard it.He was reading out a story from the Daily Express during the programme\u0027s review of newspapers and news websites. It is not the first time a Today presenter has been embarrassed by the Health Secretary\u0027s name. James Naughtie made the error while Mr Hunt was culture secretary.           Webb (pictured) tried to head off the inevitable mockery by claiming he had \u0027swerved\u0027 away from pronouncing the full four-letter word"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/18/4D96EF9E00000578-0-image-m-10_1529859651638.jpg","title":"Female reporter lectures football fan tries kiss her","story":"    Julia Guimarães was filming to camera when a football fan approached and tried to kiss her\u0027Don\u0027t do this.

Libya\u0027s coastguard has rescued nearly 1,000 migrants who were on boats in distress in the Mediterranean on their way to Europe, the navy said on Monday. Pictured: Migrants arrive at Tripoli navy base after being rescued            Three separate operations took place on Sunday with the coastguard bringing ashore in Libya a total of 948 migrants, navy spokesman Ayoub Kacem said            The migrants were on inflatable dinghies which were facing difficulties in the Mediterranean off the coast of Garabulli east of the capital Tripoli, navy officer Rami Ghommeidh saidA first group of 97 migrants were rescued, while a second operation brought 361 migrants - including 88 women and 44 children - ashore and late in the evening a final group of 490 migrants were rescued, said Kacem.In all a total of 2,000 migrants trying to make the perilous journey to Europe, often on unseaworthy boats, were either intercepted or assisted by the Libyan navy since Wednesday.Monday\u0027s announcement by the navy came as Italy\u0027s far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was en route to Libya for talks on the migrant crisis. Libya is a key departure point for thousands of migrants hoping to reach Europe, although hundreds drown each year attempting the crossing.                                                    On Sunday, 16 of the EU\u0027s 28 leaders held emergency talks in Brussels to find a way forward despite a longstanding deadlock over who should take in migrants and refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.Salvini, interior minister responsible for border control, wants his EU partners to revise the rules governing asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean so that the bloc shares out the burden of handling them.Under current EU rules, responsibility for handling boatloads of asylum seekers rests with the country where they first disembark. Italy, which lies close to North Africa, has taken in some 650,000 boat migrants since 2014.Salvini\u0027s decision to close port access to foreign-registered rescue vessels has caused a standoff with Malta, which also has refused to allow them to dock.Rescue vessel Lifeline is carrying more than 230 migrants and is stuck in international waters in the Mediterranean.A private cargo ship, the Alexander Maersk, also has been waiting to be assigned a port since it picked up 113 migrants off southern Italy on Friday, the ship owner said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/10/4D9C781A00000578-5882197-image-m-7_1529919363179.jpg","title":"Scot shocked American friend flies 4 000miles tell youre it","story":"    In the clip, filmed at a christening in Loch Lomond, Drew McEwan is told to ask a gardener in the background to move out of shot  As he approaches the woman, she springs up and tags him, revealing herself to be his friend Georgina Wilkinson.

Employees of Zaman gather after it was seized in a crackdown against Gulen supportersAfter Erdogan became the President in 2014, he survived an attempted coup by factions within the military and went on to win the referendum on increased presidential powers.At the time, Erdogan said that the plot was engineered by the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who headed up a network of schools educating people about the Hizmet movement, which promotes altruism and modesty.Since then, Turkish courts have jailed dozens of officers for alleged coup plots after the failed attempt, which claimed at least 240 lives.According to officials, Erdogan’s life was also put in danger while staying in Marmaris, but he was back in less than 12 hours with a TV appearance during which he declared himself a ‘chief commander’.Although the Turkish President has resolved economic problems, he has also been considered to be an autocratic leader who is against anyone who opposes him.Despite denying that he wants to impose Islamic values and revealing that he is committed to secularism, his supporters still refer to him as ‘Sultan’, a reference to the Ottoman Empire.Turkey lifted the ban on women wearing headscarves in the country’s state institutions in 2013 but bids to criminalise adultery and introduce alcohol-free zones failed.          Supporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wave national flags as they wait for his arrivalErdogan has also stated that ‘no Muslim family’ should consider birth control or family planning because of his aim to ‘multiply our descendants’.The AKP has also managed to keep inflation under control after the 1990s when it soared above 100 percent, but in 2014, the economy started to change and unemployment rose above 10 percent.Erdogan wifeRecep Tayyip Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran in July 4, 1978 and the couple have two sons, Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye.2018 Turkish electionsErdogan declared victory in the Turkish presidential election in June 2018 amid speculation of ‘manipulated’ results and the President received the executive powers he has sought in order to tighten his grip on the nation.The AKP will now rule over Turkey until 2023 after its victory in parliamentary and presidential polls, taking 42.5 percent while Erdogan garnered 52.5 percent of the vote. The opposition’s candidate Muharrem Ince, took nearly 31 percent.President Erdogan will now form a government as well as appoint ministers, vice presidents and top bureaucrats. He will also be able to issue decrees, prepare budgets and impose states of emergency.The role of prime minister has now been scrapped and is thought to further dilute democracy in Turkey under Erdogan’s one-man rule.Erdogan net worthRecep Tayyip Erdogan’s net worth has accumulated to approximately $58 million (£44m) and is the richest Turkish politician according to Top Richest. Erdogan was also listed as the 48th most powerful person on the 2018 Forbes list.However, this figure seems a little high for someone who just earns $58,000 (£44,000) a year, as reported by German newspaper Bild. The article then went on to cite data published by Turkish opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet which stated that all members of the Erdogan family appear to be in business.Bild also revealed that Erdgogan\u0027s son Ahmet’s net worth amounted to around $80 million (£60m) and made claims that he may be supported by the Turkish government.Erdogan’s other son Bilal, who frequently garners media attention for alleged criminal activity, now lives in Italy after being embroiled in a political corruption scandal.The Turkish President also has one of the most lavish official residences in the world, the Ak Saray, otherwise known as the White Palace, which has a whopping 1,100 rooms, 250 of which are for the sole use of the Erdogan family.Thought to be 30 times the size of the White House and believed to be the largest palace built anywhere in the world for more than 100 years, a reported £7 million was spent on carpets and another £5 million on 400 10ft high double doors.The silk wallpaper is thought to have cost £2,000 a roll and one drinking glass in the household is worth £250. Due to the numerous spas, swimming pools, bathrooms and steam rooms, the heating bill is thought to run up to £500,000 every winter.

Some people teach classes on needleplay. It can also be taught and learned through professional dungeons.\u0027And while there is a huge emphasis on design and technique, at the end of the day it is all about the pleasure. \u0027The responses that can be elicited can be visceral and sexual. It can be felt in your genitalia, feed your brain, or a mix of both. It can be a personal challenge to work through. \u0027How it feels is dependent on the person, where on the body, and needle gauge. The needles I use tend to be from 30g right down to 4g.           Across the world people engage in needleplay for pleasure           Some needleplay sessions  involve ropes and ribbons to create different designs \u0027What we refer to as a ‘bigger’ gauge, say a 10g, can feel more like a deep thuddy pain, while a ‘smaller’ gauge, say 22g and up, can feel more stingy. It is definitely an adrenaline rush.

This can involve the ritualised physical set up, the emotional processes that I can engage in during the lead up, be it listening to certain music or sitting quietly.\u0027The actual act can be an intimate, shared experience. It can also be a shared, fun experience. The pack down and clean up is also ritualised. It can involve quiet, personal contemplation, and shared conversations with partners. \u0027            There are several different sizes of needles with each sizes giving a different sensation           There is a ritualistic aspect to the sessions with many people saying it is almost spiritual A proud sadomasochist and self described \u0027pervert,\u0027 power and pain follow Jilf throughout her work. It\u0027s bold, bloody and obviously not for everyone.  With a collective of queer female artists she runs \u0027This is for art\u0027 a website dedicated to the documentation of their sadomasochism.  The website describes their work as: \u0027Beautifully abhorrent aberrations of flesh and blood assemblages.\u0027Underneath, it instructs the viewer to \u0027click here\u0027 if they feel uncomfortable and they\u0027re instantly transported to the google images search of unicorns.           Needleplay can induce a high that lasts for hours afterwards            There is a huge emphasis on informed consent throughout each session The small joke not only showcases the groups wit, but it\u0027s also an example of the strong emphasis that placed on informed consent. As with all BDSM activities, the notion of consent is central to the session - without it,  the painful pleasure could quickly slip into dangerous territory.       \u0027Informed consent is paramount,\u0027 says Jiff, \u0027For both stabber and stabbee.

Libya\u0027s coastguard has rescued nearly 1,000 migrants who were on boats in distress in the Mediterranean on their way to Europe, the navy said on Monday. Pictured: Migrants arrive at Tripoli navy base after being rescued            Three separate operations took place on Sunday with the coastguard bringing ashore in Libya a total of 948 migrants, navy spokesman Ayoub Kacem said            The migrants were on inflatable dinghies which were facing difficulties in the Mediterranean off the coast of Garabulli east of the capital Tripoli, navy officer Rami Ghommeidh saidA first group of 97 migrants were rescued, while a second operation brought 361 migrants - including 88 women and 44 children - ashore and late in the evening a final group of 490 migrants were rescued, said Kacem.In all a total of 2,000 migrants trying to make the perilous journey to Europe, often on unseaworthy boats, were either intercepted or assisted by the Libyan navy since Wednesday.Monday\u0027s announcement by the navy came as Italy\u0027s far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was en route to Libya for talks on the migrant crisis. Libya is a key departure point for thousands of migrants hoping to reach Europe, although hundreds drown each year attempting the crossing.                                                    On Sunday, 16 of the EU\u0027s 28 leaders held emergency talks in Brussels to find a way forward despite a longstanding deadlock over who should take in migrants and refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.Salvini, interior minister responsible for border control, wants his EU partners to revise the rules governing asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean so that the bloc shares out the burden of handling them.Under current EU rules, responsibility for handling boatloads of asylum seekers rests with the country where they first disembark. Italy, which lies close to North Africa, has taken in some 650,000 boat migrants since 2014.Salvini\u0027s decision to close port access to foreign-registered rescue vessels has caused a standoff with Malta, which also has refused to allow them to dock.Rescue vessel Lifeline is carrying more than 230 migrants and is stuck in international waters in the Mediterranean.A private cargo ship, the Alexander Maersk, also has been waiting to be assigned a port since it picked up 113 migrants off southern Italy on Friday, the ship owner said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/11/4D9C610800000578-5882293-image-m-17_1529923842912.jpg","title":"Cliff beach chalet goes market 850 000","story":"    Unique Home Stays say Seaglass is one of its most successful holiday homes.

It was hectic for everybody involved. I don’t think any amount of planning could have prepared us for the huge physical and emotional toll it took on everybody.

It was an amazing shared experience. It is not something I will forget in a hurry.\u0027JeebusF**K echos Jilf\u0027s sentiments. He says it the strain it put on their own bodies to perform the session was huge. \u0027Jilf asked me if I wanted to have a go at an epic session of needles and I’m always keen for science.  \u0027I have a lovehate relationship with that session. Loved what we took on and were able to do, and hated what it did to our bodies. That, we were not expecting.

Some people teach classes on needleplay. It can also be taught and learned through professional dungeons.\u0027And while there is a huge emphasis on design and technique, at the end of the day it is all about the pleasure. \u0027The responses that can be elicited can be visceral and sexual. It can be felt in your genitalia, feed your brain, or a mix of both. It can be a personal challenge to work through. \u0027How it feels is dependent on the person, where on the body, and needle gauge. The needles I use tend to be from 30g right down to 4g.           Across the world people engage in needleplay for pleasure           Some needleplay sessions  involve ropes and ribbons to create different designs \u0027What we refer to as a ‘bigger’ gauge, say a 10g, can feel more like a deep thuddy pain, while a ‘smaller’ gauge, say 22g and up, can feel more stingy. It is definitely an adrenaline rush. Endorphin\u0027s flow freely.\u0027Jilf explains that there is a ritualistic aspect to the sessions and for many people who engage in needle play, the experience boarders on spiritual.\u0027There is build up, and anticipation. This can involve the ritualised physical set up, the emotional processes that I can engage in during the lead up, be it listening to certain music or sitting quietly.\u0027The actual act can be an intimate, shared experience. It can also be a shared, fun experience. The pack down and clean up is also ritualised. It can involve quiet, personal contemplation, and shared conversations with partners. \u0027            There are several different sizes of needles with each sizes giving a different sensation           There is a ritualistic aspect to the sessions with many people saying it is almost spiritual A proud sadomasochist and self described \u0027pervert,\u0027 power and pain follow Jilf throughout her work. It\u0027s bold, bloody and obviously not for everyone.  With a collective of queer female artists she runs \u0027This is for art\u0027 a website dedicated to the documentation of their sadomasochism.  The website describes their work as: \u0027Beautifully abhorrent aberrations of flesh and blood assemblages.\u0027Underneath, it instructs the viewer to \u0027click here\u0027 if they feel uncomfortable and they\u0027re instantly transported to the google images search of unicorns.           Needleplay can induce a high that lasts for hours afterwards            There is a huge emphasis on informed consent throughout each session The small joke not only showcases the groups wit, but it\u0027s also an example of the strong emphasis that placed on informed consent. As with all BDSM activities, the notion of consent is central to the session - without it,  the painful pleasure could quickly slip into dangerous territory.       \u0027Informed consent is paramount,\u0027 says Jiff, \u0027For both stabber and stabbee.

This option is seen as a good alternative to closures – but how do the volunteers feel?It is just before 7pm on a Tuesday and Wilsden library is about to close. There are a few stragglers, mainly mums with small girls who have been at the dance class in the village hall, where the library occupies one corner.Wilsden is just one of 15 community-managed libraries in the borough of Bradford, West Yorkshire. It opens for one day a week and is staffed completely by volunteers such as Simon Dickerson, whohas volunteered at the library since it became community-managed in 2011. Prior to that, the library was run and staffed by Bradford council, but budget cuts meant that Wilsden’s library, along with branches in nearby Denholme and Wrose, were earmarked to close.“It was inconceivable that our library should close,” says Dickerson. “There was a village meeting called. About 100 people turned up and there was a very strong feeling that the library should continue.”Those three villages became the first of Bradford’s community-managed libraries. Now Wilsden has a pool of 40 or so volunteers who can work a couple of hours on a Tuesday.Like many other parts of the country, Wilsden was handed over to volunteers after Bradford council announced swingeing cuts in 2016. Out of the 29 libraries across the district (population: 528,000), 10 remained council-run, two became “hybrid” operations (a mix of volunteers and council staff), and 17 were given an ultimatum: become volunteer-run or close.So far, only one has closed (and that was due to a third-party lease on the property not being renewed). The rest were saved, due to the strength of community interest in keeping them open. But does that mean volunteer-run libraries are a success, or just delaying inevitable closures?“Local councils have seized on the volunteer idea as an easy answer to budget cuts,” Laura Swafford, chair of the Library Campaign, wrote in the  last year. “The commitment of volunteers is wholly admirable, but the result is that as a country, we have been left without a coherent library service and we have seen no real attempt to find out how well community-run libraries work.”Even before it was passed into community hands, Wilsden was only open on Tuesdays. The day coincides with the aforementioned dance classes, as well as a luncheon club for the elderly. It plays host to three or four children’s events a year, and it houses a book group. As a volunteer, does Dickerson feel it is working? “We get young people in to use the laptops, but not as much to borrow books. And perhaps if everyone who turned up to the meeting to save the library actually used it, I might be a bit happier,” he says.Bradford, where Wilsden is located, is a district of ersity and extremes. It contains some of the most poverty-stricken wards in the UK, as well as some of the richest. Ilkley is a point on Yorkshire’s so-called Golden Triangle, which has some of the highest property values in the country. And just outside Ilkley is Burley-in-Wharfedale, where the local library was handed to volunteers in April 2017.There, community ownership has not just allowed the library to survive, it has revived it, according to volunteer and former parish councillor Niccola Swan. “The library wasn’t exactly dead before, but it was a lot quieter,” she says. “When the announcement came through about library funding, it was a no-brainer for Burley. The parish council immediately said that we were not going to lose our library.”Like other community-run libraries, Burley lost all of its paid staff, who were replaced with a team of around 50 volunteers. But that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, Swan says. “The library staff we had weren’t local, they came in to do a job. While it was often a perfectly fine job, they didn’t have the incentive to be as engaged with the community.”Usage of the library has grown steadily month on month, Swan says, both in terms of visitors and books borrowed. “I’m really thrilled with what we’ve achieved,” she says.While Bradford’s libraries get their stock from the national library network, funding for maintenance and infrastructure is entirely dependent on the circumstances of each library. While Wilsden sells secondhand books and greetings cards, and receives support from the village hall association, Burley has just secured £150,000 of funding from the parish council for refurbishments, including a new roof.One crucial point with Holme Wood – and, to varying degrees the other libraries – is that they are not just about the books any more: they serve more frequently as wide-ranging “community hubs”. At Burley library, older people often drop in just to see a friendly face, while Wilsden is a lifeline for members of the luncheon club, some of whom may only leave the house once a week.Holme Wood offers resources to improve literacy and learning, through link-ups with local schools that see pupils visit the library for literacy programmes and holiday events. The local job club is based there, and there are courses to teach adults how to use the internet and access council services.“The library’s core business has changed from being only a lending service, and I think this reflects the changing face of libraries everywhere. There are new challenges that have to be faced,” says Daniel Carroll, who is All Star’s Holme Wood community liaison. “People are working together to make the library work. And that means it has to work for them, and to serve the community.”“The volunteers are part of the community, they know the place and the people,” says Swan at Burley. “We do what we always did, but now we can bend the rules. If someone wants to just come in and have a sit down and a cup of tea, then that’s absolutely fine. We’ll get the kettle on, because we can.”Libraries have, for years, provided services other than book borrowing: computer access, DVD loans, event hosting. But the rise of the volunteer-run library is evolution in its purest sense: motivated by a desire to survive. While most would agree that their local library could benefit from more funding from authorities, the reality right now seems to be that libraries are going to require the input of local communities if they are to continue to exist at all. As Dickerson says: “We’re in the middle of some very profound social changes, and those changes are still happening and will continue to happen for some time. Libraries have got to reflect that.”It is worth noting that a declining library service isn’t seen as inevitable everywhere. Ireland’s Libraries Development Committee has just unveiled a scheme to double attendance over the next five years, involving abolishing fines, extending opening hours in almost two thirds of the country’s 330 libraries to 10pm and, crucially, hiring 100 more librarians in the coming months. While the drive and enthusiasm of the UK’s volunteers should be applauded and encouraged, hopefully their willingness to step in won’t consign government investment to the history books."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe0376712e652908caf5e63d1361066e929731f0/430_125_4911_2947/master/4911.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a858135531e23b80719ad66d375af1b4","title":"poverty safari orwell books prize scottish rapper loki","story":"Judges said the polemical study of deprivation, written using his real name, Darren McGarvey, was ‘exactly the book’ that Orwell would have wanted to winScottish rapper Darren McGarvey, who performs under the name Loki, has won the Orwell prize for political books for his searing examination of poverty in Britain, Poverty Safari.Describing McGarvey’s debut as a modern-day version of George Orwell’s own memoir about poverty, Down and Out in Paris in London, chair of judges Andrew Adonis said Orwell himself would have loved Poverty Safari, a mix of memoir and polemic that sets out to understand “the anger of Britain’s underclass”. The book draws from McGarvey’s own experiences growing up in Pollok, Glasgow with a violent, alcoholic mother and from the testimonies of people in deprived communities around Britain, to argue that both the left and right misunderstand the complexity of poverty as it is experienced.The £3,000 Orwell prize goes to the book that comes closest to Orwell’s ambition “to make political writing into an art”, with past winners ranging from Keeper, Andrea Gillies’ memoir about her mother-in-law’s Alzheimer’s to John Bew’s Citizen Clem, a biography of UK primse minister Clement Attlee. This year, Poverty Safari beat titles including Ali Smith’s acclaimed post-Brexit novel Winter and Cordelia Fine’s examination of gender bias, Testosterone Rex. Adonis, who was joined by fellow judges critic Alex Clark, author Kit de Waal and Financial Times books editor Lorien Kite, said Poverty Safari was “at one and the same time very grisly and very uplifting – and also not predictable”.“It’s not just a lament against austerity but as much a hymn in praise of the power of the inidual. It’s both a big social critique and a big call to inidual liberty and empowerment,” he said. “McGarvey says iniduals matter and people really do have control of their own destiny, but they are also caught in a social condition that can be a trap.”“I know the hustle and bustle of high-rise life,” writes McGarvey in Poverty Safari, “the dark and dirty stairwells, the temperamental elevators that smell like urine and wet dog fur, the grumpy concierge, the apprehension you feel as you enter or leave the building, especially at night. I know that sense of being cut off from the world, despite having such a wonderful view of it through a window in the sky that feeling of isolation, despite being surrounded by hundreds of other people above, below and either side of you. But most of all, I understand the sense that you are invisible, despite the fact that your community can be seen for miles around and is one of the most prominent features of the city skyline.” McGarvey, who has lived through extreme poverty, addiction and homelessness and is a former rapper-in-residence at Police Scotland’s violence reduction unit, raised money through crowdfunding to enable him to focus on writing the book for a year. It was published by small Scottish independent Luath Press, but after it reached bestseller lists – and received glowing praise from JK Rowling, who said it was “hard to think of a more timely, powerful or necessary book” – Poverty Safari has now been picked up by Picador, which will co-publish a new paperback with Luath in August.Luath’s Gavin MacDougall said that he had been “convinced that this book can and will make a real difference to people’s lives” ever since McGarvey first came to see him “with an initial A4 outline of what Poverty Safari might be”.“Many books, movies and TV series could be described as ‘poverty safaris’ – Down and Out in Paris and London, Chavs, Hillbilly Elegy, The End of Eddy, I, Daniel Blake, Benefits Street and many more,” MacDougall said. “What Darren does in Poverty Safari is analyse his own lived experience to challenge the ‘poverty industry’, and all of us, to rethink our own ways of thinking. We don’t have the muscle to reach the readership this book deserves. Picador does and will.”McGarvey meanwhile, will be taking the book to the stage at the Edinburgh Fringe in August, in the show Poverty Safari Live."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/199bdf6adea6f99c40bdedf8a83e24b991f51e9e/171_34_3201_1921/master/3201.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e378237aeebdafc648ccc8cc225bbc3","title":"government rejects plan for tidal lagoon in swansea","story":"Ministers say project is too expensive but decision sparks widespread criticismThe government has rejected plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, dashing industry hopes of Britain leading development of a new source of renewable energy and sparking widespread criticism.Ministers said the project, which would have been subsidised through household energy bills for decades, was too expensive compared with alternatives such as offshore windfarms and nuclear power.The business secretary, Greg Clark, told parliament he had “left no stone unturned” in considering whether to support the scheme. “The inescapable conclusion of an extensive analysis is, however novel and appealing the proposal that has been made is … the cost that would be incurred by consumers and taxpayers would be so much higher than alternative sources of low-carbon power that it would be irresponsible to enter into a contract with the provider,” he said.Clark said backing the lagoon would cost the average consumer £700 more by 2050, compared with a mix of offshore wind and nuclear power. The capital cost for the lagoon, per unit of electricity generated, would be more than three times as much as the Hinkley Point C power station, he said.The minister said the government’s analysis had concluded there was little potential for cost reductions from future lagoons and limited local economic benefits. However, the long-awaited decision was condemned by the renewable energy industry, green groups and MPs. Mark Shorrock, the chief executive of the company behind the project, Tidal Lagoon Power, accused Clark of being misinformed.“This is a vote of no interest in Wales, no confidence in British manufacturing and no care for the planet,” he said.Labour said it was “remarkably ironic” that the announcement came on the same day as a vote on Heathrow airport expansion. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “Once again the Tories have defied all logic and failed to make the right decision for our economy, the people of Wales and the future of our planet.”Carolyn Harris, the Labour MP for Swansea East, where the lagoon would have been based, told Clark: “You will never understand the frustration and anger felt in our city today.” Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, formally tabled a vote of no confidence in the secretary of state for Wales, Alun Cairns, at the Welsh assembly. The Plaid assembly member Simon Thomas said: “The UK government has time and time again failed to invest in Wales. “The failed electrification of Wales’ railways, and now the rejection of the tidal lagoon prove that the secretary of state for Wales has no credibility and is not fit to represent Wales in public office. He must resign at once.”The trade body RenewableUK said it was disappointed by the rejection, while the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said it was “a double blow” because jobs and green energy production would be lost.Clark defended the government’s stance, saying it believed in renewable energy. He disclosed that he had more than 10 meetings this year alone with the Welsh government, which had offered a £200m equity stake or loan to make the project viable.Clark’s statement comes nearly 18 months after an independent government review strongly backed the scheme.Charles Hendry, the report’s author and a former energy minister, said the Swansea project would add the cost of only a pint of milk to annual energy bills and provide predictable, low-carbon electricity. Hendry told the  that the government had failed to recognise the longer lifetime of lagoons compared to alternatives. “The offshore wind turbines will have to have been replaced three or four times during the lifetime of a lagoon a nuclear plant would only last half as long,” he said.The project’s dismissal comes shortly after ministers said they were considering taking a multibillion-pound stake in a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in Wales. That reversed a decades-long policy of avoiding direct state ownership and will have made it possible to aim for a subsidy price much lower than the lagoon’s.The Swansea scheme’s planned generating capacity is about a 10th of Wylfa but backers said it could be followed by five large-scale lagoons, providing a home-grown source of renewable energy, jobs and an export opportunity.Gloucester-based Tidal Lagoon Power had hoped to agree a guaranteed power price with the government – known as a contract for difference – for the “pathfinder” lagoon at Swansea.The Swansea project envisaged a U-shaped breakwater built across the bay and the tide passing through 16 turbines, generating power for 155,000 homes. First proposed in 2011, the lagoon won backing from the then chancellor George Osborne, who used his 2015 budget to announce the government was commencing negotiations with Tidal Lagoon Power for the plan.Clark insisted that if future tidal lagoons could demonstrate value for money, the government would consider them. However, industry observers think Monday’s rejection is likely to kill off prospects for any future lagoons in the UK. Other technologies that harness the power of the tides are still seen as having potential."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb35c0fe38ca68a367d933099f035fb9db47df1b/25_15_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41b075c29389d3c968678c655ed126f0","title":"cities replace shops offices housing report","story":"Thinktank says in successful city centres offices make up two-thirds of commercial spaceStruggling city centres should end their dependency on retail by replacing shops with offices and housing, according to a report.The Centre for Cities thinktank said the increasing tendency for consumer spending to shift online was a particular risk for city centres in England and Wales that are overreliant on the consumer.The retail industry has been hit by a number of high-profile failures and waves of shop closures as the high street has sought to cope with the challenge posed by internet shopping amid a squeeze on living standards.The Centre for Cities said retail outlets were helped by having large numbers of office workers to sell to.The report also found that the high number of empty shops in struggling city centres reflected broader economic challenges they faced. Of the five cities with the highest number of vacant retail lots in 2017-18, four – Newport, Blackpool, Bradford and Sheffield – had a loss of city centre jobs. City centres within the greater south-east – the most productive of those studied – had on average much lower vacancy rates than cities elsewhere in the country.The thinktank recommended that cities with relatively high numbers of shops should convert some of these units into residential and office use. Where demand for offices and homes was weak, some demolition could be needed to enable the land to be used to “improve the public realm”.The Centre for Cities said the government also had a role to play in city centre regeneration and should consider intervening to supply small amounts of new office space to meet demand from high-productivity firms if the private sector was not building enough offices. It added that government should reform business rates – a tax based on a valuation of a company’s property – to allow more frequent revaluations of premises.Andrew Carter, the chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: “Each day seems to bring a new crisis for the high street but the answer is not to double down on the declining retail sector. Instead, we need to reimagine struggling city centres as places where lots of different businesses can locate and create jobs – and where lots of people want to go to for a variety of reasons. “This means reducing the reliance on shops and focusing on creating a more attractive environment for a wider range of firms. We also need to make our high streets more open and appealing spaces for people to spend time or live in, by improving public realm and transport links, and potentially introducing more housing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e80c44c658103ac1474288dd411107fe7a29c45/0_272_4240_2544/master/4240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6160832a35b1f3e46eabd713d4312fe0","title":"london birmingham and aberdeen now cost more to live in","story":"UK cities move up the ranks on worldwide cost of living list as pound rallies against the dollarThe pound’s strengthening against the dollar has increased the cost of living in London, Birmingham and Aberdeen, which have moved up the ranks of the world’s most expensive cities.Hong Kong is the world’s most expensive city for expatriates, followed by Tokyo, Zurich, Singapore and Seoul, according to a cost of living survey, which ranks 209 cities on the cost of a basket of more than 200 goods and services such as coffee, bread, milk, cinema and rent.There are no UK cities in the top 10, but London made it back into the top 20, rising 10 places to 19th. Birmingham moved up 19 spots to 128th, Aberdeen 12 places to 134th and Belfast jumped eighteen spots to 152th.Fitzpatrick added that a drop in London rent costs held back London’s rise up the rankings. Hong Kong has regained the top spot in the ranking from Luanda, now in sixth place due in part to a decline in the Angolan capital’s housing market, which has lowered rental costs. Hong Kong also came top in 2016.Expats pay the highest rent in Hong Kong – £5,486 per month for a two-bedroom unfurnished apartment “of international standards in an appropriate neighbourhood,” and £9,600 for a three-bedroom house.This compares with £3,100 a month in London for a two-bed flat and £5,000 for a three-bed house while in New York it costs £4,076 to rent a flat and £6,793 to rent a house in Luanda, which has a limited supply of the type of housing favoured by expats, rent is £3,647 for a flat and £7,866 for a house.German cities experienced some of the biggest moves in the ranking, due to rising rents and the strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Frankfurt (68th) and Berlin (71th) both jumped 49 spots while Munich (57th) climbed 41 places.Mercer’s 2018 cost of living ranking shows that a cup of coffee, including service, costs £5.54 in Hong Kong, £4.52 in Zurich, £2.80 in London, £2.52 in Tokyo and £1.75 in New York.A pair of blue jeans costs, on average, £104.34 in Buenos Aires, £102.76 in Johannesburg, £107.09 in Dubai and £85 in London, but only £41.48 in New York.A cinema ticket for an international movie is more expensive in London than any other city, costing £16.79.

But does everyone agree?You’ve hit the red stop button, the bus is slowing to a halt, the doors lurch open with a hiss, you go to disembark ... but wait.Do you thank the driver?The question of public transport protocol has become an unlikely meme on social media, alongside claims that it is the ultimate test of character – with those who give voice to their gratitude hailed as “the best of humanity”.According to KnowYourMeme, the meme originated on Reddit two weeks ago, when a user elevated “people who say thanks to the bus driver” to pharaoh status. From Reddit, the meme – reminiscent of so-called “wholesome memes”, a knowing attempt to make the internet a kinder place – spread to other platforms and was applied to various established formats, such as Exploding Brain. “People who don’t say thanks to the bus driver” were also condemned.The popular Instagram account Brown Cardigan, followed by nearly 400,000 people, embraced the cause with characteristic near-deranged fervour, collating the best – and increasingly aggressive – expressions of “unrelenting gratitude” under the hashtag: #justthankingbusdriverthings.“WOW. Huge. Memes that change lives and empower everyday heroes. Our job here is done,” read the caption beneath the story, which reported “a whole new sense of job satisfaction” and even an uptick in career change inquiries.Brown Cardigan’s self-appointment as a “conductor of goodwill” may have been facetious, but the meme nevertheless sparked an earnest debate about passenger etiquette.But debate elsewhere on the internet flagged the possibility that the weight of the implicit expectation to thank your bus driver could vary by region.In Australia, where Brown Cardigan is based, a loud “CHEERS DRIVER” or exaggerated nod of thanks is de rigueur on alighting the bus, in the smaller cities of Brisbane and Perth in particular, but not infrequently in Sydney.His tweet caught the attention of Gladiator actor and lively tweeter Russell Crowe, who agreed, adding: “It’s simple common courtesy.”But discussion in New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens – a Facebook group of nearly 100,000 mostly millennials interested in urbanist issues – suggested that view was by no means the case elsewhere in the world. Londoners in particular were singled out for scrutiny.One member described thanking the bus driver as “Irish culture”.“I used to thank bus drivers when I lived in a city where that was a thing people did,” wrote one commenter. “For now, I live in a city that mercifully rejects small talk and the forced emotional labor of giving and accepting thanks (New York) – so I no longer do.”Several respondents distinguished between the relative convenience of expressing their thanks while exiting from the front door, and the potentially unseemly volume necessary to be heard from the back.A minority were unapologetically ungrateful. One woman wrote: “I don’t talk to strangers so I don’t thank my bus driver.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29555f53b00b0ea160f9fc55e6bbf3270d66056/0_235_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461bb2b8dbf432a48500e3ad330e41f5","title":"britain heatwave how to cope drink water instagram filter","story":"Drink water, hang out in the freezer aisle and – most important – use the right filter on InstagramIt’s a truth universally acknowledged that Brits can’t deal with weather. Seemingly any weather. We’re obsessed with it, but we’re bad at it. It snows and we’re calling into work saying there’s no way we can possibly travel, despite the fact that Russians manage to grit their entire cities at 6am each morning. Temperatures reach 21C and people act like they’ve been tossed into a fiery pit of hell. And the exhaustion, oh my God. It’s a trial, so here I am with some handy tips. You can buy me a cool jug of Pimm’s later.High summer is the only time it’s ever acceptable for men to walk into a supermarket without a shirt on. Even then it’s touch and go. But might I recommend to everyone the freezer aisle? Just grab five minutes of cool respite by opening the door and nestling your hot little face next to the McCain chips and Dr Oetker pizzas.I would also recommend befriending Karen from work, who carries one of those handheld electric fans at all times. It sounds like a bee on MDMA and will get on everyone’s nerves, but it works. If you haven’t already learned that Amaro is your go-to summer months filter, then that’s where to start. Snap pics of your feet in the lapping shore of your nearest beach (crop out the plastic waste). Hold an in-focus ice-cream up in front of a flawless blue sky (rainbow sprinkles preferred). Artfully arrange this summer’s hyped new novel on a patterned picnic blanket, with a “Finally got around to reading!!!” caption, even though its publication date was a week ago (to imply that you usually finish a new release on the same day). Try not to get photobombed by a: seagull, naked child or somebody else taking a selfie.In the pub at 1pm any other day and your mates would stage an intervention, but during a “heatwave” it’s basically mandatory. If you work at a tech startup your boss has probably already passed around ice-cold beers and hired an ice-cream van for the reception, but the rest of us have to find a way to slink off to a sunny spot in a pub garden (and immediately moan that it is too hot). The humidity however, is exhausting (“Mate, I’m so tired, you tired?”, “I cannot deal”, “It’s too much for me, I need a lie down”) and adding booze to the mix is a recipe for falling asleep on the bus home. Pace yourself, and – sorry to be all public health awareness on this – but DRINK WATER. For the non-drinkers, the struggle of sipping from a Diet Coke and dealing with friends who have used heatstroke as their vodka mixer is real. TfL reported that temperatures on the tube last summer reached 31C. Which is almost a human rights violation, especially when you’re in the shadow of a thousand armpits. On the bus, there’s always that one sociopath who closes the window. People flap free-sheet papers in faces, total hazard. I would advise, if at all possible, to avoid public transport. Walk. Not just because walking keeps you fit and you spot things you would never notice otherwise, but so that you don’t arrive at your destination steaming from your insides having been cooked on the top deck of the number 24 or wearing your shirt like a second skin. As with at non-heatwave times of the year, the main piece of advice here is: don’t be a woman who is flaunting your curves, showing off your pins or displaying your assets. Wear a bag at all times, like Shia LeBeouf at Cannes. Come heatwave time, however, the tabloid paps are out in force. So just know that if you will wear a crop top near the Diana memorial fountain or dare to swim in the mixed pool on Hampstead Heath, your midriff is gonna end up on a front page.For my milkier friends out there, as someone who was once asked by a person who spoke English as a second language: “Why you have no blood?” I can empathise with the risk of sunburn. Remember that anyone, regardless of complexion or skin colour, can burn. So always put on sunscreen. But if your general skin tone is printer-paper, be sensible.I manage to burn every year without fail, which is highly amusing to friends, but also not great for obvious health reasons. Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent of all cancers. There are options to cover up. Annoyingly, because they are awful, bucket hats are making a comeback. Plenty of people are choosing to wear swimwear originally designed for religious purposes, but have reached an even wider audience. We are all excited about England doing well in the World Cup, but try to avoid becoming red and white all over.Finally, I’d like to recommend open-water swimming. It’s great any time of the year, but when temperatures soar, it’s lovely. There are open-swimming spots all around the UK. Ponds and rivers among foliage (River Derwent near Chatsworth House, Peak District) infinity pools near the sea (Tinside lido in Plymouth Jubilee pool in Penzance, Cornwall) tucked away in cities (Bristol lido) Scotland’s glorious lochs beach pools (the Tidal pool on Margate beach), and, oh wow, the lakes (the … um, entire Lake District, Hatchmere in Delamere Forest).Also, seek out a cafe terrace with those Parisian-style outdoor tables and chairs, and try to ignore how much harder it’ll be to live the life for real once Brexit comes through.

They should certainly have caused many who stayed at home to sit up and take notice too. Marches that can put 100,000 people on the streets are not common in British politics these days. It has been seven years since the TUC’s anti-cuts rally last managed such a turnout. In the run-up campaigners talked about an event this time that might, with good luck and organisation, mobilise tens of thousands. In the event, the numbers who converged on Parliament Square to call for a “people’s vote” on the Brexit terms exceeded those expectations. Sometimes these rallies feel a little dutiful, as if they are going through the motions because it is what is expected. This was definitely not one of those.What conclusions should be drawn from a protest that brought together marchers from the Greens, Liberal Democrats, Labour and Conservative parties and from all over Britain in such impressive numbers, easily eclipsing a rival pro-Brexit march of Ukip and far-right supporters? The most important, perhaps, is that on Saturday the pro-Europe cause showed it is not an elitist club. Instead it is its own kind of social movement, using social media to generate meaningful grassroots engagement. Just because it was mainly middle class it must not be treated as somehow less authentic than the leave side. On the weekend’s evidence, just as with the much larger Iraq war and countryside marches in 2002-03, there was the clear sense of voices from outside the metropolitan bubble succeeding in making their voices heard.It seems likely that Saturday will energise and give confidence to the pro-European cause as the moment of decision on the Brexit terms nears. This is highly desirable. The march should force the Conservatives and Labour to take the pro-European forces more seriously than before. In their different ways, both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have tried to ignore the half of the country that voted to remain in the European Union, and that opposes a hard Brexit in all its forms. If Saturday’s march had had a desultory turnout of the usual suspects, they would have stuck with that dismissive approach. Now they can’t be so sure. That’s another desirable outcome.Pro-Europeans in Britain and elsewhere should not misread Saturday’s march, however. There was a good turnout, but the national tide has not turned against Brexit itself or in all its forms. The march was called to demand a vote on the Brexit terms, and that question should definitely be on the table for the moment when, or if, a deal is struck. But anecdotal evidence suggests that even those who marched did so out of anger and frustration with many aspects of Britain’s break with the EU. Public opinion thinks the government is making a mess of the negotiations – which is true – but it still seems to accept that, in the end, Britain will leave the EU.The march was large and in a good cause. Yet it does no more or less than give a welcome boost to the pro-European cause. The battleground over Britain and Europe remains parliament. The test of the march, like the test of this week’s renewed warnings about jobs from business and now the business secretary Greg Clark, will be whether it shifts the balance on Brexit in the government and the Commons when we get to the crunch. That must happen. But it is not certain to do so. After all, previous ministers and MPs felt able to ignore much bigger marches on Iraq, hunting and austerity, even though some, and their parties, came to regret some of those decisions and to suffer for them.The march was a reminder that things can change. Two years after the lamented decision to leave the EU, many pro-Europeans, including MPs in leave-voting areas, feel they must accept Brexit as democratic and inevitable. Not so. Brexit is the wrong answer to Britain’s problems. A hard or no-deal Brexit would be even worse. Pro-European MPs of all parties should make the case against Brexit and in favour of economic and social policies that can address the grievances Brexit will not solve. If marches and other extra-parliamentary pressures can help give them courage to make that case, then so much the better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8a127d12e0de643cf4715bcbe3923110e4b7ec6/0_79_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b257f3f79b5679cdbb943e59f1d154","title":"how we made green wing","story":"‘Filming in a hospital was hell. We shot scenes in the recovery area, surrounded by patients coming round from their operations’We’d done three and a half series of Smack the Pony and wanted to create a different beast, one with the freedom of a sketch show but with a proper structure. Fluidity was key. Green Wing was originally called Doors, the notion being that you’d flow in with the characters and flow on through another set of doors with them.The setting was important. We tried spaceships, cruise ships, a hotel. A hospital felt too obvious at first, but it also had that range of locations – canteen, car parks, tons of corridors, which are always helpful for long tracking shots.Next we needed characters. The writing team would say “Who do you know who’s funny?” and “What was your first boyfriend like?” From that, we created a whole world of people. We actually made them – using batteries sellotaped to little blocks of wood that we’d move round the table. I still have them in a tin. One critical thing we inherited from Smack the Pony was the desire to have a strong female lead. Before we gave Tamsin Greig’s character the name Caroline Todd, we called her STP – the Smack the Pony person. We wanted her to be a powerful professional, but with all the warts and insecurities of a normal woman. When Tamsin took that on, it was heaven on earth.We gathered together a brilliant cast, especially Julian Rhind-Tutt as Dr Mac. He’s essentially a goodie but funny and sexy. We dyed his hair to make him more sexy, more like a lion. And Michelle Gomez, our staff liaison officer, had a wildness that was so appealing. During a casting session, she was reading quite normally, then she got out a tin and, in a Scottish accent, said: “De ye want a suckee sweetie?” And I just knew.We filmed in two separate hospitals, in Harrow and Basingstoke. We were given a corridor and were allowed to film when it wasn’t busy. Inevitably, we’d run over into busy periods and then it was hell on earth. People would come streaming through and we’d be trying not to trip them up. We shot scenes in the recovery area, too, surrounded by patients coming round from their operations.Peter Fincham was head of Talkback at the time. After we handed in the pilot, I remember cycling home with his words ringing in my ears: “You cannot end the episode with your romantic lead poking a poo down the toilet with a ski pole.” And I was thinking: “I’ll never work in telly again.” It did strike me that we had gone a bit mental. I think the first episode took people by surprise. They felt sick. But they got into it.I didn’t really know what was going on during the pilot. They’d say: “We want you to walk down that corridor.” And I thought: “Is this going to be a really boring show? It’s just people walking down corridors.” When I finally saw the pilot, I couldn’t believe what they had created. It was jaw-dropping, a kind of wonderful dance between all the characters.You had to watch what you said in the rehearsal room because it would find its way into the script. I remember Stephen Mangan, who played Dr Guy Secretan, told a story about some girl at a party saying to him: “You really remind me of someone.” He went through his normal list – Elliott Gould, Pete Sampras, Paul Michael Glaser – and she said: “No, it’s the donkey from Shrek!” And into the script it went.It’s very difficult to make brilliant things. If there’s a lack of them now, it’s because there’s an unwillingness to invest, to find the time and space for creativity to happen – as well as a fear of upsetting people. Everybody I know says: “I’ve got an idea for a comedy script.” And I go: “Have you? OK, you write that and let’s see how far you get.” Interestingly, we ended up on the picket line with some junior doctors. We stood with them. What use it did I don’t know, but at least it said: “We’re not just here to take the piss.” In the background of Green Wing was the idea that the NHS belongs to all of us. We have a responsibility to make sure it doesn’t die on its knees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02c48efe638211800fd97af3ace225419686c73/0_316_1751_1050/master/1751.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5726d9049ec71cc18b23de6a0e1e20d0","title":"british museum lgbtq exhibition to tour england","story":"Artefacts related to gay history include 11,000-year-old pebble depicting couple having sexThe British Museum has gathered a collection of objects with LGBTQ connections, including the world’s oldest known depiction of a couple having sex – an 11,000-year-old carved calcite pebble – to be sent on a national tour.The pebble, called the Ain Sakhri, possibly depicts gay sex, as the figures portrayed in it are ambiguous. Other items which may go on tour include a bust of Antinous – a lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian – and a silver cup buried near Jerusalem in the 1st century AD showing men having sex.The museum has created an audio tour of the objects in London and will send a number of them out on a four-venue tour of England from September.Fiona Shaw and Simon Russell Beale, who narrated the audio tour, said people would be surprised by the number of objects in the Museum with LGBTQ connections.“Many might even have seen some of them on display without knowing how they relate to queer history,” Beale said. “I’m thrilled that, thanks to this new audio tour, these stories will now take pride of place. Same-sex desire has existed in all societies and it is really important that the British Museum is highlighting this.”The Ain Sakhri shows a couple making love. Because the figures are ambiguous the museum does not assume they are of different sexes.The figurine, which was found in a cave in the Judean desert, was made by hunter-gatherers known as Natufians who were among the first people to domesticate sheep and goats. Whoever carved it has ensured that its shape is phallic but the genders are not clear.Other objects going on the tour, which begins in Oxford and goes on to Nottingham, Bolton and Norwich, include an ancient Greek vase depicting Sappho etchings of gay sex by David Hockney, inspired by the poems of C P Cavafy and a deck of cards depicting drag queens, produced in Japan in 1997.The touring show is an expanded version of the museum’s Desire, love, identity: Exploring LGBTQ histories display, which was staged last year.The audio tour will offer further insight into the 1AD silver drinking cup, known as the Warren Cup after the 19th-century gay Bostonian collector Ned Warren. He saw the cup as the “holy grail” of gay history because it showed the existence and acceptance of homosexuality long ago.The cup will be part of on-site tours at the British Museum in 2019 – the 50th anniversary of John Wolfenden becoming its director. Wolfenden chaired the committee whose landmark 1957 report recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality.People interested in volunteering for the on-site tours are being encouraged to contact the museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1581a86fbefcae9adb1586fe87c075bb7a73bb8f/0_213_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8837aa28f186b24489d791744a868dc","title":"red deer isle rum scotland in pictures","story":"A team of six scientists has descended on Rum, a small island in the Inner Hebrides on the west coast of Scotland, to catch red deer calves.

This time, Luke grabs it without hesitation. He throws on a cool pair of shades. Out of nowhere, the opening riff to THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST by IRON MAIDEN screams from the speakers. Luke smiles in slow motion, flips the bird at those LAME FISH-NUN THINGS and hops aboard his cool new ride, a space motorbike shaped like a giant penis. Just as BRUCE DICKINSON screams “YEEEEEEEEEAH!”, fire spurts out of the back of the motorbike and Luke takes off, pausing only to shoot Rey with a laser beam that turns her into a hot babe with a sexy perm. As she gyrates to the music in a gold bikini, Luke pulls his sunglasses down his nose and winks. Rey instantly orgasms but Luke has already left. That’s how cool he is.Next stop: D’QAR, where Resistance forces are under attack from the First Order. Luke’s space-bike zooms in out of nowhere and power-slides to a standstill between the opposing factions. He looks to his left and sees KYLO REN and GENERAL HUX. He looks to his right and sees FINN and ROSE cowering like losers. As the powerful shaft of his bike begins to glow, we once again hear Bruce Dickinson scream “YEEEEEEEEEAH!” and the bike blows up the entire Resistance in a sick fireball. “I’m the one true rebel now, baby,” says Luke. He looks down at the charred corpses of Rose and Finn, surrounded by the dead bodies of ANY OTHER CHARACTERS WHO AREN’T WHITE OR MALE (and also BARACK OBAMA and MY MOTHER for making me clean my room on a Saturday), pulls his sunglasses down nose and quips: “Sorry, guys, you’re just not relatable enough.” Every single bra in the entire universe pings off upon hearing such effortless wit. Luke zooms off, leaving behind a cloud that looks like Rian Johnson giving Jar Jar Binks a blowjob.Next Luke travels to the beautiful planet of JOR’DAN P’TERSON, a world where men are men and women are all hydraulic sex housewives who’ve been programmed never to laugh at your genitals, no matter how scarred and minuscule they happen to be. At the temple of Lucaas, Luke meets YODA and CHEWBACCA for an ice-cold beer. BOBA FETT strolls in wearing a MAGA cap. “The coolest, that guy still is,” says YODA.But this doesn’t solve the problem of Starkiller Base, which still threatens to blow up the whole galaxy. So Luke takes the best possible course of action: re-creating the final act of A NEW HOPE beat for beat over and over again for two hours, which is the only thing that fans want anyway. The base explodes, Iron Maiden blares out of the speakers and Luke Skywalker negs a sexy alien until she agrees to have sex with him. All is right with the galaxy once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/732d74c3f3e8e049937b9832fc7e35978108238a/0_109_876_526/master/876.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d167a67605bad935f5a5172767ee7824","title":"argentina what is wrong lionel messi football","story":"So many things are wrong with Argentina we do not know what is wrong so much is happening no one\u0026nbspknows what is happening. You could start\u0026nbspan article on the news pages with that same line but they fit on the sports pages too because these are turbulent times for our football. It was not always like this. For many\u0026nbspyears, football made up for our\u0026nbsplong political, social and economic decline.There is no identifiable moment when it all started, nor one place where it began, and there is no dominant theory. What is true is that bit by bit we got further away from the ball, the one thing we loved\u0026nbspmore than the game itself. We\u0026nbspgot further from a style that used to draw us to the stadium, where we longed to shout “olé!” every time we saw someone dribble, trick an opponent, tease them every time we saw a lightning one-two or some expression of cunning, that astuteness – that was our life. There was talent of the highest quality and in the greatest quantity and we allowed ourselves an act of genius once in a while.Football matters to us it allows us to feel like we are among the best in the world at something with huge popular significance. Its relevance is such that, to give but one example, through football we thought we had recovered the Malvinas in 1986 thanks to Diego Maradona, a national hero ever since. So the disaster of the national team leaves us with a feeling of neglect and emptiness that is hard to explain. How are we supposed to know what to do with football if we\u0026nbspdon’t even\u0026nbspknow what to do with Lionel\u0026nbspMessi?Let’s go back to the start. The street was always our school, which had the great virtue of teaching us the trade, giving football a cultural weight and developing and celebrating players who were different. But the street as a formative stage has gone and no one has known how to replace it with an educational model like those in countries such as Germany or Spain. We always had too little money, organisational ability and vision – and, in our arrogance, too much confidence in our status as a predestined footballing power.On top of that, an imperious, almost delirious need to win overcame the enjoyment of playing. The desire to win at all costs sweeps away your values. Dividing the world\u0026nbspinto winners and losers is an\u0026nbspillness that infected football at a\u0026nbspformative stage.At the same time a passion for football was overcome by a passion for a team, as if a society that has become ever more inidualistic needed something to reconnect it with tribal feeling. Turning clubs into mini-nations constructs an identity, a community that must be defended as a matter of life and death. In the stands violence took over on the pitch, we said goodbye to the olés and welcomed in a world where huevos – balls – are more important than talent.We saw that against Croatia. People were shouting at the players to show more huevos and sitting in the stands Diego expressed that by grabbing his testicles. Yes, Diego: the man who represented better than anyone else the best of what we had, our former style. That desire to fight turns every game in the Argentinian\u0026nbspleague into an indecipherable swarm like an ants’ nest, where someone kicks it and everyone runs more than they think,\u0026nbspand where in the middle of it all it can be hard to work out who the\u0026nbspgood player is.There are other variables in the equation: economic crisis, institutional chaos, televised football as a political weapon, corruption at all levels among those who run the game. The world did not help either: globalisation made us an export economy in which any player, however mediocre, is three goals away from being sold abroad. This premature escape, our footballing diaspora, saw us lose one of the great\u0026nbspteachers: emulation. Maradona is a purely Argentinian product Messi is a mix of his origins in Argentina and his development and completion in Barcelona.Nor do I want to overlook something of great importance: the mediocrity of the debate, where a base crassness more suited to bad actors than good journalists bastardises the play and denigrates players. This infernal racket conditions everything, a deafening noise that surrounds everything and made the Argentinian people believe that if Messi does not win a World Cup he will never be Maradona that made Messi himself believe it.Thirty-three titles later, Messi has taken that message to heart and when the World Cup starts he becomes a tortured soul who carries the fierce demands of 45 million people on his shoulders. And yet it’s not true: Messi has defended Argentina’s footballing pride like no one else for 15 years now and he has done so with an astonishing, scandalous consistency. But that perception became received wisdom and Messi is treated as if he was any old player by journalists who demand an excellence from him they cannot even dream of.In Russia, it has all come together. The crisis of talent. (Did we really only find out on the day Croatia put three past us that we do not have anyone comparable to Luka Modric or Ivan Rakitic?). The lack of leadership. (Is there really no one around the national team who can shake them out of it with words worthy of the impending crisis?) The vulgarity and paucity of the debate. (Have we really forgotten what it was that made us great?) We have to evolve and after the tournament we must begin a revolution in education that can return our lost prestige. We have the genetics that can help us, a history that can propel us, a pride that will give us energy and strength. But education requires time, not haste, and in Argentina we have all lost patience and calm. How can we come up with an urgent solution with problems of such magnitude?As we wait to play Nigeria, the team appear lost, the rumours about internal conflicts spreading, and no one knows what is going on inside the head of Messi – one of the best-known men in the world but whose silences no one can interpret. If Argentina think their problems will be resolved by appealing to courage and fight, their emotional and footballing collapse will follow and with it their discipline. We will finish\u0026nbspthe third game with someone\u0026nbspsent off, a red card to add to the disaster.The decline begins with culture, and we have to recognise the lads gave all the huevos the fans demanded. But huevos are not enough. To wear down a team like Iceland, to overcome a great team like Croatia and to confront Nigeria’s\u0026nbspsense of adventure, we will\u0026nbspneed all the qualities and the values that Argentinian football has\u0026nbsplost along the way. Skill, quality,\u0026nbspfantasy, cunning, precision\u0026nbspwe need to bring that together in a style that can create a collective conviction, an identity, capable of turning this disparate group into a team. Not even a genius can make up for so many failings. Still less, a genius who\u0026nbspis dispirited.Jorge Valdano scored for Argentina in the 3-2 win over West Germany in the 1986 World Cup final and managed Real Madrid 1994-96"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144025ef1bfcefb59f4cffa2aa2469cfc1feb7bb/13_223_4650_2791/master/4650.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a48d65f89a11091292a09ae96f9ad57e","title":"gareth southgate harry kane england belgium","story":"• Manager hints he may rest captain to give others playing time• ‘Harry knows the team is the most important thing’As England’s footballers continue to rewrite the way they are perceived around the world, from the Spanish sports daily Marca dubbing Harry Kane “the Hurricane” to La Gazzetta dello Sport in Italy noting “a security and spectacularity that historically they never usually have”, Gareth Southgate has been encouraging his players to soak it in and enjoy the moment. It was time, according to the manager, to “get the music on and have a couple of beers”.Only a couple, mind. Zaliv, the one nightclub in Repino, is open late only on Fridays and Saturdays and not, perhaps, a typical haunt for England’s players, given Frankie Boyle’s description of it on his BBC documentary before the tournament as “last orders at your cousin’s wedding”.The team chose instead to stay at their hotel, toasting their early qualification for the last 16. And why not when they are even getting praise, of sorts, from an old enemy? “It is time for all of Scotland to be afraid,” according to the Daily Record, which noted England would regret it for ever if Southgate – “a bit of a dry lunch, but so what?” – did not get his hands on the “big lump of glorious gold almost winking in their direction, beckoning them to step forward and claim it for their own”.At which point it is probably worth reiterating that England’s victories so far have come against moderate sides and, to be picky, that Southgate’s men have not managed a clean sheet in either match, with some legitimate misgivings about how they might cope at the back against more efficient opponents.England can certainly be emboldened by the fact they have won their opening two fixtures for only the third time since 1950, that the team are playing with energy and effervescence and that Kane, in particular, seems absolutely determined to leave his mark on this tournament.Kane’s five-goal haul against Tunisia and Panama would already have been enough to win the Golden Boot outright in 1962 and jointly with Miroslav Klose in 2006 and Thomas Müller in 2010. He is one short of Mario Kempes’s winning total in 1978, Paolo Rossi in 1982, Gary Lineker in 1986, Totò Schillaci in 1990, Hristo Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko in 1994 and Davor Suker in 1998. Kane gives the impression he is as driven by these awards as Cristiano Ronaldo, so much so that Southgate wondered whether his captain might “have the hump” for being substituted against Panama. For Kane, it is almost an obsession to see his name at the top of the scoring charts.All of which might warrant a delicate conversation if Southgate, as he appears to be leaning, has any plans to leave Kane out of the match against Belgium on Thursday that will determine which of the two teams, both already qualified, goes through as Group G winners.That suggests Southgate is contemplating keeping him back for England’s first knockout tie, either in Rostov on Monday or Moscow the following day. Kane, of course, has let it be known he does not want a rest. Yet Southgate has also said that his priority is to look after some of the players who have not featured so far and, more than once, he has mentioned “the harmony” of the group. Steven Gerrard once referred to the England camp as a “five-star prison” and, behind the gates of the team hotel, Southgate is aware of the potential for the non-playing members of his squad to start feeling down and that, in turn, to create problems.Belgium will definitely make widespread changes, with Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku among the players expected to be rested, and in Southgate’s case there are four outfield players – Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Gary Cahill and Trent Alexander-Arnold – who have not played a single minute. Dele Alli hopes to be fit again and Kieran Trippier will be closely monitored after being substituted, as a precaution, against Panama.By the time the game kicks off, England will also have a much better idea of the pros and cons of finishing first or second and the best route to avoid a potential quarter-final showdown with Germany or Brazil. It may work out better in the long run to go through as runners-up in a group where England and Belgium are currently separated only by their bookings count. Nobody, however, should believe England, currently top, will go to Kaliningrad with the specific intention of surrendering that position.“For our country, that would be a very difficult mindset to have,” Southgate said. “We want to win every game of football we go into. I don’t know how we would go into a game not wanting to win and play well, so I think that’s dangerous territory if we start trying to plot and predict where we might end up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5252583b6b45be33b1ff441fbf5c07835ab90e3a/663_221_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68c8c143a131fb1c7340c536e692765c","title":"iran portugal world cup group b match report","story":"A late penalty earned a draw for Iran against Portugal in a bad-tempered group decider in Saransk that was dominated by VAR decisions and saw Portugal go through to the last 16 despite a tense final few minutes.Iran’s Portuguese coach, Carlos Queiroz, ranted at Fifa and the VAR system afterwards, suggesting Cristiano Ronaldo should have been sent off for a late elbow on Morteza Pouraliganji. The Paraguayan referee, Enrique Cáceres, reviewed footage of the incident for what seemed like an age before eventually showing a yellow card.“Elbow is a red card in the rules, the rules doesn’t say if it’s Messi or Ronaldo,” said Queiroz.VAR featured in two other key moments in the match, with a penalty awarded for each side after video review. Ronaldo’s penalty, early in the second half, was saved, while Iran’s late, controversial penalty was converted with aplomb by Karim Ansarifard. The goal cancelled out Ricardo Quaresma’s opener but was not enough for Iran, serving only to send Portugal into the harder section of the draw and pushing Spain top of the group on goal difference.The equaliser did lead to a frantic last few minutes, in which Iran pushed for a second goal that would have taken them through. For a brief moment half the stadium thought Iran had found an unlikely winner but Mehdi Taremi’s shot had hit the side-netting and then it was all over.The decisive moment of skill in the match came not from Ronaldo but from Quaresma, who just before half-time curled a superb shot with the outside of his boot across the keeper, Alireza Beiranvand, and into the top corner from the corner of the area. Beiranvand, whose ing arm was just shy of the ball, looked sickened, but in reality there was little he could have done to stop the shot.The first half-hour include many crunching tackles and few clear-cut chances, with the Iranians in particular looking tense due to the importance of the game. This was most visible on the 10-minute mark, after a mix-up between Beiranvand and Saeid Ezatolahi, with the player sliding in to clear just as his goalkeeper was approaching to scoop up the ball. Instead the loose ball fell to João Mário. He shot over but Beiranvand shoved Ezatolahi in the chest and yelled some choice words at him. Soon afterwards Beiranvand spilled what should have been a routine cross and was lucky the ball broke to his own player.Iran tackled hard and, for the most part in the first half, fairly. Alireza Jahanbakhsh caused Portugal problems down the right on Iran’s occasional forays forward and Raphaël Guerreiro got a booking for bringing him down just outside the box.The goal, just before half-time, led Iranian heads to droop and briefly quelled the endless din of vuvuzelas inside the stadium, where Iran fans predominated. However, they were buoyed soon after the restart. Ronaldo had a leg clipped by Ezatolahi just inside the penalty area. The referee was having none of it and in a pre-VAR world Ronaldo’s reputation for falling easily would have meant that was the end of the matter.But the men in the VAR room soon signalled to the referee that he ought to have a look again. On seeing the replay he had no choice but to award Portugal the penalty, the protests of the Iranians leading to nothing but a booking for Ehsan Hajsafi. Beiranvand, who had looked dodgy all night, made amends with a brilliant save, starting off in a position behind his goal-line and bouncing forward.The saved penalty drew tremendous cheers from the Iranian fans and spurred the team on to a period of attacking. Saman Ghoddos, on for Jahanbakhsh, who had faded out of the game in the second half, scuffed a low shot just wide of a post but for the most part Portugal were in control and the great roars that accompanied every Iran attack became less frequent.They resorted to looking for unlikely penalties: three times in the second half Iranian players went down optimistically in the area. Queiroz was warned by the referee for furiously making VAR gestures on the touchline.The game became more vicious as it went on, with crunching tackles, ing and impassioned harassment of the referee coming from both sides. It seemed Portugal would hold out for the win but there was still drama to come. First was the VAR decision on the red card for Ronaldo. The contact was there but weak and in the end the referee went for a compromise yellow.74 min: Sardar Azmoun goes down after a challenge from William Carvalho.

Like Anglesey sea salt, this variety of new potato is legally protected for the particular flavour the local soil imparts. Today’s recipes put them to work: a sort of vegetarian niçoise with a mustard dressing and an easy, cheesy, potato-topped flatbread. Of course, any variety of new potato could be used here.This is essentially a cheat’s way to a white pizza with potato. If you’d like to add a little more green, pile it with shaved asparagus or peppery salad leaves when it comes out of the oven. If you want to make your own flatbreads, try this recipe for yoghurt flatbreads.1 red onion, peeled and thinly slicedOlive oil4 new potatoesA few sprigs of thyme, leaves picked2 flatbreadsSalt and black pepper 4 tbsp creme fraiche or ricottaAbout 20g parmesan (I use a vegetarian one)Bring a pan of salted water to a boil. Put a frying pan on a medium heat, add a little olive oil and the sliced onions, and cook for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet.Slice the potatoes as thinly as you can – you could use a mandoline here. Blanch the sliced potatoes in the boiling water for about two to three minutes, until they have lost their rawness but still hold their shape. Drain and leave to steam dry, then toss with the thyme, some salt and pepper, and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.Lay the flatbreads on a baking tray and heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Spread the creme fraiche or ricotta over the breads, top with the onions, then the potatoes, and finish with a good grating of parmesan.Cook for eight to 10 minutes, until everything has melted together. I start making this salad when the asparagus and new potatoes arrive in May, and stop when the nights begin to draw in. The vegetables change with the season, but this version is my favourite – one that makes the most of the best tomatoes and runner beans. The key to this salad is the sharp dressing, which mellows as it hits the vegetables. Pour it over the potatoes while they are warm, crushing them a little so the dressing flavours them all the way through.500g new potatoesFlaky sea salt4 eggs100g kalamata olives1 small cucumber300g mixed ripe tomatoes2 tbsp baby capers300g runner or green beans, topped and tailed and cut on the diagonal into 3cm piecesA few sprigs of dill and parsley, leaves picked and roughly choppedLemon zest (optional)For the dressing3 tsp dijon mustard2 tsp wholegrain mustard4 tbsp olive oil3 tbsp white-wine vinegar1 tsp runny honeyPut the new potatoes into a medium saucepan with a generous pinch of salt and cover with lots of cold water – you need a good amount of water as you will be adding other things to the pan later. Bring to a boil, then leave to simmer for 12–20 minutes (depending on their size).In another small pan, bring some salted water to a rolling boil, add the eggs and cook for six minutes, so the middles are only just set if you’d like them hard-boiled, cook for one minute more. Run the cooked eggs under cold water for 30 seconds, then crack the shell on a hard surface and leave to cool.Meanwhile, make the dressing by whisking together all the ingredients, then taste and season. You want it to be quite punchy, because it will mellow when it hits everything else.Pit the olives and rip them in half. Slice the cucumber thickly. Roughly chop the tomatoes into different sized pieces and season well with salt. Put them all into a large bowl with the capers.When the potatoes are nearly cooked, add the beans to the pan and cook for the final three to four minutes. Drain everything and leave to steam dry in the colander. Once the potatoes have lost their moisture, add them to the bowl while they are still warm and pour over the dressing. Use the back of a spoon to crush them lightly, so they split and soak up some of the dressing.Peel the cooled eggs and cut into quarters, dot them around the bowl and finish with the chopped herbs and lemon zest, if using."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983dd26cc7cb21ac94cd905ceec037f1a210a77a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01a36e9c0ba256d43f58f52ca7fd7493","title":"seven ways to strengthen your core","story":"Keeping these muscles in good condition will help you fend off a bad back – just make sure you mix it upA strong core isn’t about having photogenic abs, looking good in swimwear or grinding out another deadlift. It is a key element in dozens of everyday movements, including simple things such as carrying your shopping or getting out of bed in the morning. Many people know that a weak core can lead to a bad back, but the benefits of strengthening it are sometimes underappreciated. An analysis of studies published between 1970 and 2011, for instance, found that “core stability exercise was better than general exercise for reducing pain” in chronic low back pain patients. Given that back pain affects 540 million people globally, just five or 10 minutes a few times a week spent improving core strength is an excellent investment.Spine researcher Dr Stuart McGill at the University of Waterloo in Canada has spent his career studying back pain and its rehabilitation. He recommends a “big three” set of exercises. This consists of the curl-up, the bird dog (or quadruped) and the side bridge, all of which are low-intensity and suitable for almost everyone.Gyms usually offer short core-strength classes. Even if you much prefer exercising at home, it is always a good idea to make sure you are doing exercises correctly to avoid injury. Fitness apps such as Gixo and TrueBe use your smartphone camera to connect you to a trainer, so you can also have a one-off or “booster” PT session at home.Crunches and sit-ups were once the go-to core exercise for gymgoers and fitness routines. But these exercises are now thought to be quite hard on your back and to isolate muscles that would be better exercised in combination. Plank exercises – and other more dynamic movements – use more muscles at the front, side and back of your core. There are many different varieties, starting with the simple half plank – on your forearms and knees, rather than toes, maintaining a straight back. Longer is not always better: good form maintained for a small time is much better than bad form dragged out for minutes.Dead bugs are one of the simplest and most effective core exercises. Lie on your back with your arms extended, knees bent at 90 degrees, calves parallel to the floor. Keeping your lower back in contact with the floor, extend and lower your left leg and bring your right arm up. Tap your heel to the floor, return to the start and repeat with the opposite arm and leg, making sure your lower back never arches.Mixing it up is crucial, as is focusing on trying to keep your deepest abdominal muscles “engaged” – they are the ones you will feel when you cough. To add difficulty to a home routine, consider a TRX suspension trainer or a Swiss ball. These add a stability challenge to standard exercises. Others swear by pilates – although a Cochrane review suggested that, while it is effective, it is no more so than others form of exercise for pain and disability."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/196e86f6f882a928793f2200c1c96cdb38673fa5/0_1181_3742_2245/master/3742.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0e8cc6fe730189307ab9af2f2cfc9d8","title":"observer guardian carole cadwalladr wins orwell journalism prize","story":"Reporter recognised for ‘amazing’ investigation into Cambridge AnalyticaThe Observer and  reporter Carole Cadwalladr has won the Orwell journalism prize for her investigation into the collapsed political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.The prize is awarded by the Orwell Foundation for the best political writing of the year, with the support of the family of the writer George Orwell. Cadwalladr said her experience of reporting the story, which resulted in the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg issuing a public apology for the misuse of user data, had been “like being strapped to a freight train for the last 18 months”. “What we are seeing here is a systemic failure,” Cadwalladr told an audience in central London after collecting the prize. “Our laws do not work and our regulators are unable to regulate. We do not have the information we need from the big tech platforms.”The judges praised her “whole set of amazing stories” and said they believed that “if George Orwell had been here he would have been unanimous in choosing our winner”. The Orwell prize for exposing Britain’s social evils went to Sarah O’Connor, John Burn-Murdoch and Christopher Nunn of the Financial Times for their study of the British towns left behind by the modern economy. The Orwell book prize went to a visibly overwhelmed Darren McGarvey, also known as the rapper Loki, for his book Poverty Safari, which explores deprivation in Glasgow. It was described as “not just an excellent example of political writing” but also “a book which needed to be written”. Meanwhile, the Crick prize for the best article in the journal Political Quarterly went to Helen Thompson of the University of Cambridge.The prize-giving was preceded by a debate on the impact of the Grenfell Tower disaster on society. The writer Anthony Anaxagorou, who lost friends in the fire, urged the public “to read more critically between the lines and to want more from their journalism”. Orwell’s son Richard Blair, who helped present the prizes, said his father would have cast a critical eye over the Grenfell disaster and the media response. “Were he alive, and had this happened in his time, he would have very quickly cut through a lot of the obfuscation on all sides – both press and government.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ec55218c37ea4fc30f78355b802d3c05e565ba5/0_30_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baaaeca9820cc69dea1738dfa83c8b02","title":"britain is becoming a stupid country melvyn bragg says","story":"Broadcaster argues ‘best university system in the world’ is being carelessly destroyedMelvyn Bragg has said Britain is becoming a stupid country, in part because its university system is being destroyed.The broadcaster and Labour peer criticised the state of British higher education in an interview with the magazine Radio Times.“We have, per capita, the best university system in the world, but it’s being – carelessly and utterly stupidly – destroyed very slowly,” he said. “We used to be the clever country and now we’re clearly the stupid country. Except for certain highlights.”Bragg, the host of The South Bank Show and the presenter of Radio 4’s discussion programme In Our Time, told the magazine he saw some hope in the UK’s current television output, especially in the work of the actors Hugh Grant and Benedict Cumberbatch.“Patrick Melrose and A Very English Scandal were sensationally good,” he said. “Those were great productions with main actors on top form. You could talk about the Redgrave-Olivier years – well, now you can talk about the Grant-Cumberbatch years in equal terms.”Bragg, 78, also revealed he had recently spent some time in hospital. “I had a hip replacement.

It’s a bit of a pain.”The broadcaster, officially known as Lord Bragg of Wigton after the Cumbria town where he grew up, was recently appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour, an elite group of 65 iniduals recognised for their contribution to the Commonwealth.Bragg, whose South Bank Show was aired by ITV for decades, told the Daily Mail this month that he had yet to see the network’s latest hit, Love Island.“The popularity of series like Love Island show that we’re becoming increasingly eccentric and increasingly incompetent – in equal measure,” he said. “I mean to watch it.

He has also backed Tommy Robinson, the founder of the anti-Islam English Defence League (EDL) street movement, who was jailed in May for contempt of court.The party’s rules forbid former members of the EDL or other far-right groups from joining. A Ukip spokesman confirmed that Watson, Meechan and Benjamin had joined, saying he “took issue” with the notion they were from the alt-right.All three are vocal on social media, with large followings and often controversial views. Watson, who has 875,000 Twitter followers, is a senior editor at Infowars, the US-based website that deals partly in conspiracy theories, such as arguing that the Sandy Hook primary school shooting was a hoax.Watson describes himself as a “classical liberal”, but mainly offers posts condemning immigration and Islam, and seeking to bait leftwingers.Meechan, from North Lanarkshire, is best known for being fined £800 by a court earlier this year after he posted an online video of his girlfriend’s pug dog giving Nazi salutes, raising its paw in response to statements such as “Sieg Heil”. He has nearly 250,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel.He is now banned from Twitter, but remains on YouTube, where he has 810,000 subscribers.All three had spoken via social media of their intention to join Ukip, a process seemingly sparked earlier this month when Meechan promised to do so if the pledge was retweeted 10,000 times.Batten’s sympathy towards such figures is not a surprise. He has spoken alongside Meechan and Benjamin at events connected to Robinson, and was recently photographed alongside Benjamin and Watson. Their membership was welcomed by Ukip’s London assembly member David Kurten, who tweeted his pleasure at the news.A spokesman for the group Hope Not Hate, which monitors alt-right groups among others said: “There are attempts afoot to forge an alliance between extreme figures who have made their names online, those involved in electoral politics, and those out on the streets, around an anti-Muslim and pro- ‘free speech’ agenda. “In following the path he’s chosen, Batten is leading Ukip down a dangerous route, and the acceptance of figures such as Watson is further evidence of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0607351293da74aac4be2c5bdc44c9e0e31c50f/0_334_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b18d8de10b0a851a95bb0199e7827a6","title":"all babies should be given vitamin d from birth say experts","story":"Pregnant women and babies should be monitored to ensure that they are getting enough vitamin D following upsurge in ricketsBabies are at risk of dying of rickets, a disease thought eradicated decades ago, because mothers and pregnant women are not being advised of the need for vitamin D supplements, according to experts.Noah Thahane died last year at the age of six months from heart failure. It was a consequence of rickets, caused by a severe deficiency of vitamin D, the so-called sunshine vitamin. Experts at the University of Birmingham say his death was entirely preventable and are calling for all babies to be supplemented from birth and for mandatory monitoring by GPs and other NHS staff. Pregnant women must all be advised about the need for vitamin D and take supplements, they say.“I’m very concerned that what we see is only the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr Wolfgang Högler, consultant endocrinologist at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. “There are many more cases that we don’t know about.”The department of health says every baby should get daily doses of vitamin D from the age of six months and those who are breastfed should have it from birth, because formula milk has it added. The guidance is outdated and confusing, say the researchers.Högler says all babies should have it from birth and those not taking it should be picked up when babies are given their vaccinations. “Why are we preventing infections but not preventing rickets in the same way?” he asked.The paper Högler co-authored describes three cases of babies of aged six months or less who became very ill because of lack of vitamin D in the journal BMC Pediatrics . The other two recovered. All were born to women of black, Asian and minority ethnic origin. Dark skin and a lack of sunshine – either because of living in a northerly climate or through covering up – reduces the amount of vitamin D that the skin produces. So does a lack of calcium in the diet.The UK has a “vitamin D winter” – insufficient sunshine for dark skins in particular to make the vitamin – for six months of the year. “It is no surprise,” says the paper, “that the cases we report presented in early spring.”Noah’s mother Beverley said her son, who was of African descent, had been suffering unexplained seizures. In January last year, he had a cardiac arrest at home and doctors were unable to save him.Thahane, 37, a hospital clerical officer from Telford, Shropshire, said: “I was utterly heartbroken when Noah died and horrified to learn that Noah’s death could have been entirely prevented.“I had not been informed of the need for infant vitamin D supplementation, or that we were at greater risk due to having dark skin, and I had no idea how catastrophic the effects of a vitamin deficiency can be.”Rickets was eradicated from the UK during the second world war when food was fortified with vitamins. Since that stopped, it has returned but largely under the radar, says Högler. He believes that the surest way to keep babies safe would be to fortify food once more.“It is the most elegant and the cheapest way,” he said. “We could put a safe amount of vitamin D into food and particularly foods that high-risk groups eat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88bd4b3972b5f084d1c5b284c01154d64ed846f0/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a284bea356d5efc1175542d5da73db9","title":"lewis hamilton mercedes french grand prix sebastian vettel max verstappen f1","story":"After a poor performance in Canada Mercedes struck back strongly in France and before the race Lewis Hamilton revealed the methodology behind the improvement. “We as a team have all sat down and each and every person has been critical of themselves, including me,” he said. “When they have their big meetings back at the factory they are very, very openly critical. The cool thing is when you come out of those meetings everyone acknowledges: ‘You know what, there are things I can do better, now I will do better rather than making excuses.’” If this sounds familiar, mandatory self-criticism was a central tenet of Maoist political doctrine and used extensively under The Chairman. Whether the great leap forward for Mercedes was down to the engineers and indeed drivers acknowledging their ideological errors to one another – and what one might now refer to as the party hierarchy in Brackley – or just the upgraded-spec engine may become clearer in Austria and Silverstone.Sebastian Vettel’s mistake into turn one, meant a straight comparison between the pace of his Ferrari and Hamilton’s Mercedes was difficult to gauge but a broad perspective suggests the British driver’s team have the front foot for the remainder of this triple-header. In qualifying pace Hamilton appeared to have gained six-tenths of a second on Vettel since Canada. A variety of factors will have played their part: the new engine, the temperature, the track and even Vettel losing third practice due to rain – the session this season when he has usually superbly fine-tuned his ride. But there was also the use of the 0.4mm-thinner tread tyres, last seen when Hamilton was utterly dominant in Spain. They are employed by Pirelli on tracks where there is a fear of overheating and the Mercedes clearly enjoys the characteristics of this rubber more than the Ferrari. They will be confident going into Austria then but positively beaming in Hamilton’s back yard when the thin tread reappears at Silverstone.With three podium finishes in four races Max Verstappen has gone some way to silencing his critics. Vettel was one, suggesting the Dutchman needed to adapt his driving style after he hit the German in China. It was clearly with not a little glee that Verstappen replied when asked his opinion on Vettel’s incident. “I think next time you see Seb you should ask him to change his style. Because honestly, it’s not acceptable. That’s what they said to me at the beginning of the season. And then, of course, Seb shouldn’t do anything, and just drive again and learn from this and go on. That’s my advice to everyone in this room.” He got a good laugh but shortly afterwards it became clear that the issue genuinely really did still rankle for the young driver. “It just makes me angry, because it won’t be as bad on him as it was for me. But I didn’t change a thing, and now everything is going right. At the end of the day they will never get the last laugh because I know what to do. It’s just annoying.”The pride of French fans at the return of their grand prix after a 10-year absence was a pleasure to behold on race day, with the grandstands awash in a sea of tricolours but the sellout crowd of 65,000 spent much of their weekend with gritted teeth. Traffic problems plagued the circuit with many fans stuck in queues for hours on end attempting to enter and leave the track. Given that it was funded by seven local authorities to the tune of €14m, more infrastructure investment might have been expected. They are learning the lessons that took Silverstone so long and has largely successfully addressed with efficient traffic management and an extensive park-and-ride system. At Ricard there were disgruntled fans who said they would not return and while the passion in France is clear, guaranteeing an improvement next year is key to the future of the race.The weekend began poorly for McLaren when “chocolate-gate” emerged: reports that there was widespread dissatisfaction at the team, epitomised when staff were given 25p chocolate bars as a bonus for hard work. The team were left trying to shift the attention back to racing but on track there was no respite. The car has a well-identified problem in a lack of grip through low-speed corners and at Ricard its shortcomings were manifold. Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne had their worst qualifying of the year, with the Spaniard ultimately retiring from last place and Vandoorne finishing in 12th. Alonso’s frustration was clear but their problem goes beyond confectionery. The team’s CEO, Zak Brown, admitted the aerodynamic issue did not show up in the wind tunnel and thus was having to be addressed and fixed on track at race weekends. Which raises the most serious question. How did McLaren, of all teams, allow their design to come so far with such a fundamental issue unidentified?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bef56bc522403f84f0cc493c56dd14b24425e876/0_334_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b7b0aac9872efb433c0f3f54b743651","title":"outground cricket surrey yorkshire","story":"To North Marine Road!

Top-of-the table Surrey and fifth-placed Yorkshire, with the blessing of the ECB, have sweet-talked Sky into waiving their broadcast rights for the game.This means that anyone who dearly wishes to be positioned in a blue-and-white striped deckchair, the wooded legs pushed up to the boundary edge, sun beating down on outstretched shins, lips dry with the salt swinging over with the sea breeze, needs only to log on to the Surrey or Yorkshire website or turn over to Sky Digital.Online coverage of Championship cricket has undergone a remarkable renaissance over the last couple of years, just as county cricket’s death knell was being rung. There is free streaming of most games, thanks to two fixed cameras behind the bowlers’ arms – originally installed for the benefit of ECB analysts – on most county’s websites. And local BBC radio covers every ball of every match online. Things have come a long way since a couple of county cricket enthusiasts on the  sports desk wondered about the possibility of creating a live blog.But this collaboration between Yorkshire and Surrey takes the coverage to a different level. The four cameras follow the ball from bat to boundary or high up towards the handsome old terraces from where holidaymakers have long been leaning out of the window to keep an eye on proceedings below. The accompanying commentary team, led by Surrey’s Mark Church and Johnny Barran – who drove up to the ground together in a camper van – will feature local young blades and gnarled old pros to add a teacake of colour to what will be only the third visit of Surrey to Scarborough for a Championship game. The last was a bad-tempered draw after Yorkshire were deducted eight points by the pitch inspectors.It is a small miracle of every summer that outground cricket lives on despite the demands of the modern game and only seven home Championship matches a season. Yorkshire will travel to Scarborough twice – in fact for their very next home Championship match that, because of T20’s summer domination, does not start until 19 August.They are not alone in their wanderings. In July Gloucestershire will decamp to Cheltenham and the genteel hum of the festival, Derbyshire to crooked-spired Chesterfield Lancashire will spend late August in Southport, when Glamorgan will be off to Colwyn Bay. Each game brings with it a slightly faded, sometimes eccentric circus. The welcoming outground, which has long prepared, straightens its tie and steps into the ring. There are raffles and beer tents, sponge cakes in the refreshment stands. There are dignitaries and sponsors, pensioners and children, able to inspect the pitch at lunchtime and applaud their heroes from a distance close enough to see the beads of sweat trickle into their beards of exhaustion. There are quirks and there are ticks – the sixes hit, and lost, into Woodbridge Road, the dressed crab in the sponsors’ tent at Scarborough.At Guildford last week one could sit on the stackable white plastic chairs laid out at the start of each day and watch Morne Morkel, more rapid than eagles, high-stepping in from the beer-tent end and, when the final Somerset wicket fell, see his little boy run on to the pitch to be lifted high into his father’s arms. At Tunbridge Wells, famous rhododendrons past their bloom, one could have supped while Ian Bell in the late-flowering form of his life made 172, cover drive after cover drive, as Warwickshire got tantalisingly close to a record run-chase.At beautiful Arundel one might have tasted the future with centuries from the young Sussex talents Tom Haines and Philip Salt, and at Swansea, where the terraces brine-ily loom, spied Usman Khawaja and Kiran Carlson turn the game on its head while dining on Welsh cakes.But it is not just the cricket that sticks in the memory. One Wednesday in June 17 years ago, I was sent by the  to Ilford to cover Essex against Surrey. Seventeen wickets fell in the day but the most memorable action happened off the field. First a man’s trousers became impaled on a railing as he tried to leap over the fence to avoid the £9 entrance fee. And then a joy rider attempted to evade the police by hot-footing it across the ground. (He failed.)Of course it works best in the sun. Of course it works best when every ball is enthralling. But to watch cricket at an outground, to sit on the worn benches at Scarborough this week and gaze at the red-brick pavilion where so many have unpacked their bags in hope, just a short stroll from the crashes of the North Sea, is one of life’s pleasures. And a cheap one – £16 at North Marine Road and waiting, for free, if you turn on your computer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f902ba3cbc6b779045543d3bef318621200dc897/416_785_6463_3877/master/6463.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0689233912291a254cb5b58f5e62eb","title":"rachel parris comedian musical standup political satire mash show","story":"The whip-smart comic talks about mocking Piers Morgan and Donald Trump, mixing scorn with good cheer and moving from songs to satire‘Determined cheerfulness is something I happen to do very well,” says Rachel Parris.

Her whip-smart work on the BBC show The Mash Report has been adored – and deplored – by tens of millions, and she’s become one of the most prominent political comics in the UK and beyond.On the one hand, it’s a classic rags-to-riches story, from an act whose spring tour – tickets hitherto hard to shift – ended up playing to packed houses. On the other, Parris makes no bones about how unsettling the past few months have been. Judging by the number of times she says she doesn’t know if she’s allowed to answer my questions, she’s still adjusting to life under a new kind of scrutiny.The 34-year-old feels misrepresented by the widely told story of her breakout success. In February, her weekly Mash Report slot mocked Piers Morgan’s ITV interviewlove-in with the US president, replete with a graphic of the former’s tongue up the latter’s backside. It made a very big splash: “There was a lot of excitement and fury,” says Parris, euphemistically (I think she means hostility and hysteria), “directed at my door. And now everyone’s like, oh it was that item that blew everything up with The Mash Report. But it wasn’t. It was the sexual harassment one.” This was a heavily sardonic tutorial in How Not to Sexually Harass Someone that Parris co-wrote and performed (with host Nish Kumar as her stooge) two weeks before.That episode, she recalls, aired without fuss. But her life changed when the BBC tweeted her clip from it the following Monday morning. “Within three hours it had millions of views,” says Parris. “My phone was going ding ding ding ding. It all happened so quickly.” In both the harassment and the TrumpMorgan segments – and in later ones exploring the phenomenon of the public apology, say, or Jacob Rees-Mogg – Parris mixed scorn and butter-wouldn’t-melt good cheer into a highly potent satirical cocktail. Even in the first series, she says, “the joke was to have me reading out egregiously offensive or stupid social media output, and staying very upbeat while I did so”.Her success as a satirist has surprised her, too – although she insists on the small-p political content of her prior work, and its consistency with her Mash Report material. “Yes it’s about Jacob Rees-Mogg, but it’s also about how that affects feminism, women’s rights. For me, there’s always got to be a personal or social angle.”She’s delighted, meanwhile, to have shaken off the musical comedy label, which sees her patronised by fellow comics and has, Parris argues, kept her off panel shows. “Over the years, producers have said, ‘what would Rachel do on it? There isn’t a slot to do one of her songs.’ And it’s like: ‘No, I talk as well!’” No such problem any more: it’s amazing what a reported 26m online views can do. “Now, instead of having to fight to get in the audition room, people are – for the moment – coming and asking me if I want to be on.”That’s “a dream come true”, she says: her appearance on QI in particular. But she’s not abandoning live performance – with her colleagues in the Regency-era improv format Austentatious, resident monthly in the West End. Nor in her solo shows: she’s now cooking up a “greatest hits plus bits of The Mash Report” package to take on the road in autumn. It’s designed to break new fans in gently to what she’s been doing on stage for years. Otherwise, she says – drawing on recent experience – “the initial reaction is ‘why is Rachel Parris who does political satire trying to sing and play? Has she lost her mind?’”And then? Well, Parris is hoping for some calm after the storm (“I think things are going back to normal now …”), but by no means a return to obscurity. Her first half of 2018 “has changed the whole concept of a career path”, she says, “because what would have seemed like a pipe dream now seems possible”. Alongside the autumn tour, there’s series three of The Mash Report, due later this year. Beyond that, she nurses an ambition to emulate Tim Minchin’s transformation from comedian to musical-theatre maestro – and dreams of writing her own sitcom or Victoria Wood-style solo TV show. “Which all my instincts tell me is not going to happen,” says Parris, modest to a fault. “But after the year I’ve had, it now seems like – well, who knows?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0d7f3285f0208251bdeb535131a170a7fe5bef/400_580_3903_2342/master/3903.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1439e91fb03a402126f2ea90aac0184f","title":"apple appease customer free macbook keyboard repairs","story":"Company’s admission over faulty keyboards follows litany of complaints Apple has admitted that its MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop keyboards made since 2015 are susceptible to becoming stuck or breaking, and is promising to repair them for free.Following a litany of user complaints across support forums, specialist media, class action lawsuits and 31,000-strong online petitions, Apple said it had determined that a “small percentage of the keyboards” were affected by the issues.The keys can feel sticky and letters or characters can fail to appear when the key is pressed, or keys can repeat unexpectedly.Keys were found to be prone to becoming stuck when small amounts of dust and debris collected under them, leading to inoperable keyboards and irate users. A second iteration of the keyboard was launched in 2016, which also appears to be affected.“Apple or an Apple authorised service provider will service eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards, free of charge,” the company said in a new support document. “The type of service will be determined after the keyboard is examined and may involve the replacement of one or more keys or the whole keyboard.”The 12in MacBook made from early 2015 and the 13in and 15in MacBook Pros made from 2016 are covered by the repair programme up to four years from when they were purchased. Apple also said that consumers who had already paid for a repair could request a refund of the charges, which could have cost hundreds of pounds.This is the second time in 12 months that Apple has relented on support issues to attempt to appease customers and maintain brand loyalty. In December, it admitted to slowing down iPhones with ageing batteries and reduced the cost of its battery replacement programme.Market watchers welcomed the news in appeasing customers of Apple’s computer line. But Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights \u0026amp Strategy, said the issues simply illustrate just how loyal users were to Apple’s brand and platform. He said on Twitter: “Apple Keyboardgate demonstrating. Just how loyal and forgiving Mac users are.

Party all night!”Organisers did not respond to requests for comment, but the Modball website said this year’s rally began on Sunday with the first leg of the journey running from London to Paris.The website said drivers were not supposed to race but it hadn’t stopped dozens from competing to be the first to arrive at the daily destinations during the week-long event.Three drivers were caught going 230kmh on the same highway during the 2016 edition of the rally.“It’s an official rally, but what isn’t really official is the speed – they say everyone is free to drive the way they want,” one driver in a French two-man team told AFP.“I respect the 130kmh limit in France, so at most I’ll do 150kmh,” he said.This year’s Modball involves 180 modified speedsters heading from London to Paris, Lyon, Monaco, Venice and Vienna, where the rally is set to wrap up on Friday.The race fee of nearly £3,000 per person – or £4,000 for the luxury package – also gives participants access to lavish parties, though the Modball website stipulates they are not “required to drink alcohol”.“I’ve paid €15,000 (£13,200) to participate,” said the French driver, who asked to remain anonymous, citing food and gas expenses.He said he had rounded up sponsors to help offset the costs, putting their logos on his car, a colourful Mini.“I even got a porn site, because I wanted to laugh a bit. You might as well have something crazy,” he said.Organisers insisted they had not encouraged speeding at the event.“We focus on the events each night and keep driving time down to ensure safe journeys between cities,” they said on the Modball Facebook page.Four of the drivers stopped on Sunday were temporarily prohibited from driving in France, and were only allowed to continue after their teammates took their place.The Ferrari and McLaren drivers were fined €750 each and will have to appear in court at a later date in nearby Saint-Omer, prosecutors said.The other drivers stopped by authorities were issued standard speeding tickets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58a7ef2c86dbe5c867c8eaea661294d15430e063/0_225_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae19cbf7bb886f9771820899ba2e4147","title":"mep european parliament vote eu sanction hungary viktor orban","story":"Ministers opt to launch procedure over rule of law violations under Viktor Orbán British Conservatives are under fire in Brussels after voting against triggering an EU sanction process against Hungary over violations of the rule of law under the prime minister, Viktor Orbán.MEPs on the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee voted to launch the EU’s disciplinary procedure against the country, a lengthy legal process that could lead to Hungary being stripped of EU voting rights.But the Tories stood accused of trampling over their own legacy, after their MEP on the committee voted against the process, a decision described as “an exit from European values” by a leading politician from a rival party.Hungary is very unlikely to lose its voting rights, but the unprecedented vote on Monday is a symbolic move against Orbán, who was re-elected for a third term in April, after a campaign that international observers said had clearly favoured the ruling coalition and was characterised by intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric.“This is a damning indictment of the state of British European policy and completely destroys any credibility the Tories might have left,” said Sophie in ’t Veld of the Dutch Democrats 66 party, who is on the committee.“Even Conservative governments of the recent past were always promotors of democracy and the rule of law in central and eastern Europe, but in providing cover for Orbán’s descent into authoritarianism, they have trampled on this legacy.”“Voting with Orbán is the true Tory Brexit: the exit from European values,” she said, adding that it was a sad day.Conservative MEPs also voted against taking similar action against Poland, fuelling concerns about whether a Brexit-bound government would sideline democratic values to curry favour with autocratic governments.Conservative home affairs spokesman Daniel Dalton said: “The extremely one-sided report I voted against today was an inappropriate attempt by the European parliament to insert itself into domestic political battles. Recent attempts to raise domestic controversies to a European level are both wrong and counterproductive, alienating many citizens who feel their countries are being unfairly targeted by the European institutions.” The decision by MEPs throws down a gauntlet to Europe’s most powerful political alliance, the European People’s party (EPP), the group Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker are a part of, which has been accused of legitimatising Orbán by keeping his Fidesz party in its ranks.The vote is only a first step a final decision to launch the procedure requires a two-thirds majority in the European parliament.If a majority of MEPs vote in September, ministers will be obliged to consider whether there is a serious and persistent breach of the EU’s basic democratic values in Hungary.The Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini had spent 13 months drafting a report to prepare for the unprecedented procedure. It is based on the work of many international organisations and raises 12 key concerns about the erosion of democracy in Hungary. The draft report highlights fears about the functioning of Hungary’s constitution, which has been amended six times since 2012. It also itemises concerns about the centralisation of justice, declining transparency over state funds and threats to freedom of expression and the right to equal treatment.The report was completed before the Hungarian parliament passed widely criticised anti-immigrant laws last week that made it a criminal offence punishable by a jail term to help people lodge asylum claims.The European commission is “now going to review the Hungarian legislation on migration to determine whether it is compatible with European rules”, a spokeswoman said last week.Hungary’s response was made plain in a radio interview during which Orbán lashed out at the commission for “pestering, pressuring and attacking Poland” and “attacking Hungary”.He described Sargentini, as “one of George Soros’s people”, in a now familiar attack against the billionaire philanthropist, the EU and civil society groups. Orbán has long demonised the Hungarian-born Soros in a relentless campaign widely seen to have antisemitic overtones.The EU triggered the rule of law process for the first time in 2017, when it took action against Poland for changes to the judiciary that international experts say threaten the rule of law.Poland’s EU affairs minister will appear before his 27 counterparts from the other member states at a hearing on Tuesday, where he will seek to counter the charge of a “systemic threat” to Polish democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6642dd6248f2a7ed282165503abd6b6e17ec5229/0_0_3072_2048/master/3072.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a01aca61b2c6ee43e5ff8101cdd3e989 480w","title":"tobacco industry child labour malawi special report","story":"Tiyamike Phiri is 14, with the long skinny legs of a girl entering adolescence. In another world, she would be with friends in the school playground. Instead, she is bent double at the hips, gouging out weeds from the earth under a savage sun between banked rows of tobacco plants using a heavy hoe, made of a tree branch and a metal plate.About this contentShe looks up in some wonderment, unused to questioning such a life for a child. She is not unusual. There are 18 tenant families on this tobacco farm in the Kasungu district of Malawi, each living in a straw hut. Only two of the other girls go to school, she says. Two-year-old Jackson Phiri stumbles past. He has a miniature hoe, fashioned by his father, Lazaro, because he cried every time he saw his mother and father set off for the fields carrying tools and wanted one for himself. There seems an inevitability about the lives of these children.Without a pen and an exercise book, she could not do schoolwork, her teachers pointed out. But she lives with her older brother and his wife and baby and they have nothing. “I help them in the fields,” she said.She would go back if she could. “I would like to do nursing,” she said. Instead, she weeds, builds earth banks for the tobacco plants and sews the harvested leaves together to suspend them from branches so they dry in the air. Weeding is the worst. “It is a hard job,” she said.Tiyamike is just one of many children in Malawi who see little future beyond the tobacco fields. A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million worldwide under the age of 14. The figures are hard to come by, but the International Labour Organization last year reported that child labour was on the increase, in spite of the tobacco companies’ protestations that they are working to end it. “Child labour is rampant,” the report said.These children live in the poorest of families. Tiyamike’s brother Madalitso Phiri, 27, took her in seven years ago after their father died. He doesn’t want her or the rest of his family to work in the tobacco fields. Like many of the tenant farmers, he sees tobacco as a cash crop that will give him a windfall at harvest time, with which he can change their lives. “I need to get capital so I can buy land and stand on my own two feet and my children can be brought up well,” he said. “I want my children to own shops and sell things.”It’s a dream the tenant farmers all nurture. That when the money comes in, they can go back to their home villages and buy land to farm for themselves or open businesses. But when the crop is sold, the money is never enough.Yeriko Phiri, 26, and his wife, Esther Banda, 20, thought their son, three-year-old Chifundo, had malaria. They took him to hospital, with a promise from their landlord that he would pay the bill. Eight days later, Yeriko was still working alone in the fields. He and his neighbours were very worried – without Esther’s help, he would not be able to get all the work done. In the end, Esther offered to leave her pots and plates, which she had been using to prepare food for herself and her son, with the hospital as surety. Then she set off on the 9km walk home, with Chifundo on her back.When she arrived home, the family were together again, but not smiling. “We haven’t had lunch today. We don’t have money to go to the mill to grind maize.”The families are given a weekly ration of maize, which they grind to a flour, mix with water and eat twice a day as a porridge. They are given salt and the tools they need, but have no cash unless they do extra piecework in the maize fields.Because he was alone, Yeriko could not do the piecework after working on the tobacco plot to afford the 300 kwacha (40 cents or 30p) to mill a pail of maize.The 17 tenant families – 18 including the farm manager – started the season in October and will work on the land for about 10 months until the crop is sold and they get their money.The leaf-buying companies, Alliance One, Universal – in Malawi known as Limbe Leaf – and the tobacco giant Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which does its own buying, grade the tobacco and decide the prices farmers are paid. The leaf buying firms say they tell contract farmers not to use children and that stopping child labour is a priority.In Malawi, the bales are transported by lorry to the auction halls in the capital, Lilongwe – a cost paid by the farmers. Most farmers are under contract to a leaf buyer. If they don’t take the price they are offered, they could put their bales up for auction but they risk not selling at all.Studies of the livelihoods of farmers in five low-income countries led by the economic and health policy research programme of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia, have found that farmers at the end of a season just repay debts. “Unequivocally for the vast preponderance of these leaseholders, the livelihood is very bad,” said Jeffrey Drope, the programme’s vice-president.Farming tobacco to produce the leaf that fills cigarettes can involve: Drope said that families “admitted to pulling their kids out of school to work in handling tobacco directly without protection”. The children were exposed to wet leaves – with the danger of contracting green tobacco sickness – as well as fertilisers and pesticide, he said. The companies insist under-18s are only permitted to work with dry tobacco and that they have training policies to minimise risks with green tobacco“Handling dried tobacco is not considered as hazardous work,” JTI said.BAT says education is key on safe practices​ with green tobacco​ PMI\u0027s prevention advice includes wearing long sleeves, gloves or rainwear. A study in Malawi, headed by Donald Makoka of the Centre for Agricultural Research and Development in Lilongwe, found even the earnings of the contract and independent farmers who sublet to tenants were inadequate.For the tenant farmers, whose cheap labour substantially contributes to the profits made by the companies, it’s a grinding life of hard labour seven days a week. But it is only human to try to alleviate stress from time to time.In the farm the  visited in Kasungu, Isaac Mboba, 20, has made a guitar from an old vegetable oil canister and a piece of wood. “My aim was to become a musician … I never saw a guitar but I thought I could create my own musical instrument. I saw pictures in the newspapers.”Mboba sings as the children dance. “My friends, this is the world  Take care of it  People are not good  The whole world has problems  Help us, hold our hands  We are poor  Don’t leave us alone.”The tobacco industry says it is opposed to exploitative child labour. All the major companies contribute to the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco (ECLT) Foundation, set up in 2000, including Philip Morris International (PMI), BAT and JTI, as well as the leaf buyers Alliance One and Universal. The International Labour Organization, the only UN agency to have dealings and take funds for projects from the industry, is an adviser to the board. Because it is independent, the companies say, the foundation can require governments to take action.The companies say they have made it clear to farmers that they must not use child labour. PMI established a programme in 2011 “to improve labor practices and progressively eliminate child labor on all farms from which we purchase tobacco”. There is monitoring and countrywide assessments of labour practices and “engagement with stakeholders” for improvement.Green tobacco sickness is a form of nicotine poisoning that workers can be vulnerable to absorbing through their skin, especially if the leaves are wet because of rain, dew or sweat.What are the symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, headaches, and dizziness while farmers are working or several hours after work ends. Symptoms can last 24 hours extreme cases may require emergency help. Tobacco firms say they ban under 18s from hazardous work and only allow them to handle dry tobacco when there is no risk to health.How prevalent is it? One US study found about one in four workers harvesting tobacco in North Carolina suffered from green tobacco sickness in a single season.PMI funds the NGO Verité, which works towards “supply chain sustainability”, to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme, it says on its website.BAT says: “We have always made it clear to all our suppliers of tobacco leaf and contracted farmers that exploitative child labour and other human rights abuses will not be tolerated.”BAT says it commissioned a report from a development consultancy called DD International in 2012 which found tobacco farmers were not trapped in poverty but were increasing in prosperity. The report looked at 40 or so case studies in three countries – Brazil, Bangladesh and Uganda.BAT and JTI consider it acceptable for children of between 13 and 15 years of age to do light work on a family farm, provided it is light work permitted by local law. JTI quotes the ILO, which says: “Work that does not affect their health andor personal development, or interfere with their education, can generally be regarded as positive.”JTI says all its suppliers are assessed via the Sustainable Tobacco Programme. The company has a scheme called Arise (Achieving Reduction of Child Labor in Support of Education), which it says has taken more than 39,000 children out of child labor in Malawi, Brazil, Zambia and Tanzania since 2011.Alliance One says the elimination of child labour is a “top priority”. It purchases most of its tobacco from contracted farmers whom it can direct to comply with policies including “a prohibition against employing anyone under the age of 18 for hazardous tasks”. It seeks compliance through education and training and has more than 700 people in Malawi working on “agronomic and labor standards” with farmers. It also has a commitment to improving farmers’ incomes, it says.Universal says it takes “the issue of child labor very seriously” and is undertaking “significant efforts around the world to mitigate the risk of child labor in our supply chain”.Reporting and EditingSarah Boseley and Mark OliverDesignersJuweek Adolphe and Sam Morris"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Gerard Craughwell claims President is delaying any announcement for tactical reasonsPublic Accounts Committee is told delay in setting up panel due to \u0026lsquostaffing issues\u0026rsquoThursday forecast to be hottest day of year with 30 degree heat expected in some areasScouting Ireland\u0026rsquos funding restored for three months following reform commitmentSupreme Court ruled a year ago ban on asylum-seekers accessing work was unconstitutionalDarren Kearns left Cumiskey\u0026rsquos pub on Blackhorse Ave before several shots fired into carThe expert group will produce the report within a six-month timeframeHealth service runs up overrun of \u0026euro101m in the first two months of 2018Some 285,000 of 500,000 tickets for papal Mass during Dublin visit gone, organisers sayOrganisation has \u0026lsquofully accepted\u0026rsquo the recommendations of expert reviewYellow warning now in effect as Met \u0026Eacuteireann say temperatures expected to hit 30 degrees this weekEmily Logan says family bonds should not be \u0026lsquosevered\u0026rsquo by national bordersIRA member was questioned by Belfast brigade over botched operation to buy forged bank notesCourt hears man was attacked after entering bar with group armed with baseball batsSinn F\u0026eacutein, Labour and Independent councillors agreed formal pact to rotate the roleHiggins says it is a sign of hope that newly arrived immigrants engage with languageBishop Harold Miller says he \u0026lsquonever once heard anyone speak harshly, in anger, aggressively\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543436.1529952213!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"glorious summer weather set to stay for at least another 10 days","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosie Reeve (3), from Hertfordshire and visiting grandparents in Cobh,   at Garryvoe Beach, east Cork on Monday.

In many countries a heatwave is something to be feared. In Greece, people die. In Ireland, it is something to be enjoyed.”He cautioned, however, that it is a long way to go before the summer can be compared with that of 1995, when Ireland basked in six weeks of unbroken sunshine.The only cloud on the horizon is the absence of any clouds on the horizon. Irish Water has warned that water levels in rivers and lakes are dropping significantly and drought conditions could be similar to those experienced in 1976.Water levels have become most acute in the greater Dublin area. The public are being encouraged to take steps to reduce water usage. These include not using a hose to water the garden or cars and taking showers rather than baths."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543514.1529957204!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government to lift some restrictions facing asylum seekers looking for work","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan: he may be in charge of granting work permitsThe Government is to lift some of the restrictions facing asylum-seekers seeking work, and allow for greater access to social welfare payments and alternative accommodation.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is to seek Cabinet approval on Tuesday to address some of the difficulties faced by asylum-seekers in availing of employment, including abolishing fees they pay in accessing work permits.The developments come a year after the Supreme Court ruled the ban on asylum-seekers accessing work was unconstitutional. However, no work permits have been granted since the ruling due to the restrictions enforced.Under the current scheme applicants must apply for an employment permit from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation under the Employment Permits Act 2003. The scheme also requires that they pay between €500 to €1,000 for a six- to 12-month employment permit.Asylum-seekers living in direct provision currently have a weekly allowance of €21.60, and can buy food using a recently-introduced points system.According to the rules, they must secure a job that pays a starting salary of at least €30,000 per year, and may not work in any of 60 different sectors, including in hospitality, food, healthcare, social work, childcare, marketing, administration, textiles, printing, housekeeping and construction.It is understood Mr Flanagan will relax aspects of this system, including broader access to occupations and easier access to work permits. The Minister for Justice will also be in charge of granting such permits.The Government will also agree those who are in work should qualify for social welfare payments when they make the appropriate contributions, and that those in direct provision should qualify for “alternative mainstream accommodation”.The changes will be considered by Cabinet on Tuesday, and will be announced by Mr Flanagan on Wednesday.The  understands a significant number of Government departments, including the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the Department of Health the Department of Education and the Attorney General’s office, have all offered observations to the proposals by Mr Flanagan.Last year the Supreme Court heard a case from a Burmese man who had spent eight years in direct provision before getting refugee status. He won his appeal over laws preventing him working in Ireland before his status was decided.The seven-judge court unanimously agreed the absolute ban was “in principle” unconstitutional, but adjourned making any formal orders for six months to allow the legislature to consider how to address the situation.The new scheme, which will remain in force until a full work-permit system is drawn up for asylum-seekers, has been strongly criticised by advocates.Figures show 5,096 people were living in direct provision in December 2017.Many have been in the system awaiting a decision on their future for years.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2184100.1529959692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"senator three names short of securing presidential nomination","story":"Senator Gerard Craughwell has said it will be “difficult” to identify 20 Oireachtas members to sign his nomination papers to run for President.Mr Craughwell told The  17 people from across the Dáil and Seanad had pledged to support him, but the final few names were proving tough to secure.The Senator said he would be contacting local authorities over the coming days to seek their support for his bid to run for presidency.As reported at the weekend, President Michael D Higgins has indicated to Government he wishes to serve a second term in office.Speaking to The , Mr Craughwell said: “A lot of people have said they will support me.

However, Ms McDonald has insisted Sinn Féin is very supportive of Mr Higgins.A spokesman for Mr Higgins said the President would announce his intentions in early July.Mr Craughwell argued the President was delaying the announcement to prevent his challengers from securing support.The Houses of the Oireachtas will rise on July 13th at the latest, and the Senator believes Mr Higgins will not confirm his intentions until after that date.“Prospective candidates will find it very difficult to contact politicians during that period. Nobody is suggesting the President has not done a good job, but he should be reappointed by public support, not by coronation,” Mr Craughwell added.The Government has provisionally set a date of October 26th for the vote, which will coincide with two referendums.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has secured Cabinet approval to hold a vote on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution and a separate one on deleting a constitutional clause on the place of the woman in a home.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543410.1529948996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"erdogan s election victory paves way for sweeping new powers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan waving to supporters  at  AK Party headquarters  in Ankara  after his decisive election victory. Photograph: Getty ImagesTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan struck a defiant tone following his victory in elections on Sunday that have paved the way for a new presidential system granting him sweeping powers.“There is no stopping for us until we bring Turkey, which we saved from plotters, coupists and political and economic hitmen, street gangs and terrorist organisations, to among the top 10 economies in the world,” he told supporters at a rally in Ankara in the early hours of Monday.Pro-government media and Mr Erdogan were criticised for claiming victory in the presidential election before all votes had been counted on Sunday night, but official tallies by the high election board released on Monday showed Mr Erdogan had secured around 53 per cent of the vote.Mr Erdogan’s ruling AK Party also claimed victory in parliamentary elections held on Sunday, taking 42.5 per cent of the vote, while its ultranationalist ally, the MHP, surpassed expectations by winning 11 per cent.Unlike in the aftermath of last year’s tightly-fought constitutional referendum, which also went in Mr Erdogan’s favour, few protests opposing Sunday’s results were held in Istanbul or in other major cities. In Ankara on Monday, the hundreds of police officers that filled city centre streets the previous evening had been removed following raucous celebrations by Mr Erdogan supporters that continued throughout Sunday night. Analysts and numerous polls had predicted a tighter race, and Mr Erdogan surprised many by securing a first-round victory. Istanbul and Ankara voted for Mr Erdogan by 50 per cent and 51.5 per cent respectively, illustrating the polarised nature of Turkish society today.However, by defeating all competitors in the first round Mr Erdogan now has a mandate to rule Turkey unencumbered in a regime he could lead for another decade. And while he made ending a two-year-old state of emergency an election campaign promise, little pressure can now be put on him to do so.His victory speech in Ankara in the early hours of Monday made clear that he plans to continue his campaigns against dissent and perceived enemies, including Kurds both inside Turkey and in Iraq and Syria, and supporters of Fethullah Gülen, the US-based cleric Mr Erdogan blames for a failed coup attempt in July 2016. Turkey remains a repressive country for dissidents. Hundreds of independent media outlets have been shut down and dozens of journalists jailed. At least 73 were in prison in December last year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. As the press conference began Mr Ince asked journalists from the state TV broadcaster to leave in an apparent response to its failure to broadcast his major election speeches. He told reporters that the current regime was “a great danger to Turkey”. While Mr Ince’s CHP remains the largest opposition party in Turkey, winning around 147 seats, it will be bitterly disappointed with failing to take Mr Erdogan to a second round given it put together such a robust campaign.In what will become one of the most erse parliaments in years, the Kurdish-focused HDP garnered more than 11 per cent of the vote, which should see it hold 67 seats in parliament.It’s a remarkable result for a party whose members have been jailed, driven from the country in fear of arrest and frequently branded as terrorists or terrorist supporters by the government and media. The party’s former co-leader, Selahattin Demirtas, who campaigned from his prison cell in northwest Turkey, where he has been held on charges of terrorist propaganda for the past 20 months, finished third in the presidential race with 8.4 per cent. “The fact that HDP is included in the assembly in these conditions is a great success,” lawyers for Mr Demirtas wrote on his Twitter account.Western leaders will be concerned to see that the MHP is now the kingmaker in Turkish politics. The extreme nationalist party will not support any attempts at reconciliation with Kurdish separatists, meaning Turkey’s military operations in northern Iraq and Syria are likely to continue. The MHP’s hold over Mr Erdogan will likely see Turkey continue to forge closer ties with Russia, from whom Ankara is expected to receive delivery of a major missile defence system in the coming months. While under the new executive system Mr Erdogan has unprecedented powers to govern, he won’t want the MHP rocking the boat. The West can also expect obstacles to enhanced co-operation on the issue of refugees as Mr Erdogan will feel no pressure to bow to demands from Europe. “He is the only person in charge. There is no one to challenge him,” says the HDP’s Hisyar Ozsoy. “It’s going to be tough.”"},{"url":null,"title":"military veterans struggling adapt civilian life mods tick box2","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMilitary veterans are struggling to adapt to civilian life, a charity has warned, as former service personnel criticised the Ministry of Defence\u0027s tick-box support. Many working-age service leavers feel “undervalued by society and misunderstood by civilians” with the resettlement process failing to address their lost sense of belonging, the study by Ssafa, the Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen’s Families Association, found..  The charity surveyed over 1,100 former service personnel between the ages of 18 and 49, for a new report titled The Nation’s Duty: Challenging society’s disservice to a new generation of veterans. Over three quarters of those polled (77 per cent) - all of whom had sought help from the charity - said they felt they were not fully prepared for civilian life with 19 per cent saying the resettlement package failed to provide them with suitable skills or qualifications to find a job. Sir Andrew Gregory, SSAFA’s Chief Executive, said: “Support for the Armed Forces means more than just supporting them during active duty, it means creating a welcoming environment for them to re-enter when their time is served.”Sir Stuart Peach has said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.The report comes in the wake of comments by the outgoing Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Stuart Peach, who said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.“The absolute majority of people who served in the Armed Forces return to fulfilling lives enriched by the experience. We are not all heroes and we are not all broken by service,” he said in his valedictory speech earlier this month.Gemma Morgan, an army veteran, told the : “The military puts huge effort into creating a separate society, a separate fighting force, for good operational reasons,” she added, “but sometimes the real world can be more complicated and there is often a reverse culture-shock and loss of that sense of belonging once someone leaves”.She blames the “tick-box exercise” of resettlement for not properly allowing veterans to create a new sense of purpose after their service. Instead of just writing CVs, those leaving military service “need the space to decompress away from the team to ask ‘who the hell am I?’” says Ms Morgan..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to changeArmy veteran Gemma Morgan“If you still see yourself as a soldier after you’ve left, you’ll never transition.”“The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to change. This can be a quick win and we need to start doing it properly for the sake of the veterans.”Speaking exclusively to the , Mark McDonald, a veteran of 23 years service, revealed how he needed help transitioning back into civilian life having been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2005. “Once you leave the gates you’re on your own unless you ask for help,” he said, “and pride can be a problem sometimes.”“My pride got in the way of me asking for a mobility scooter, but my wife talked me into it. Now I can do the shopping or go with my son to watch his football matches.”He was shocked and angry to be told that as a former soldier his local authority wanted to do extra checks as part of his application to foster his son, in case he had been “institutionalised”.“Did they think I’d have my child marching up and down outside the house?” he asked. “Would they do this with a former policeman or ambulance driver?”Ssafa helped Mr McDonald with his financial planning after being medically discharged in 2013. He feels service leavers should receive such help as standard on resettlement courses.“In the military all your bills for food, accommodation and tax come out of your pay before you get it.

the North East, North West, West Midlands and Southwest - are now subject to the Met Office warning, meaning temperatures are expected to exceed heatwave thresholds, which range from 28C in the North East to 30C in the Southwest.The Local Government Association issued a plea not to neglect the elderly or vulnerable, more than 2,000 of whom died in England during the heatwave of 2003.“The hundreds of deaths caused by temperatures each year are avoidable,” said chairman Izzi Seccombe.“No one is immune to the power of the sun.”Water UK, which represents regional water companies, said heavy rainfall during spring had left aquifer levels robust.However, Anglian Water issued a detailed list of do’s and don’t to prevent waste, including “leaving the sprinkler in the shed this summer”.“Grass is extremely hard to kill - your lawn will soon bounce back and be vibrant and green again,” a spokesman said, adding: “Forget the paddling pool and head to the beach...if you’ve already filled the paddling pool for the day, don’t empty it, you can save loads on your water bill by using gentle disinfectant tablets that keep the paddling pool water fresh for days.”Failing that, Anglian customers are advised to use the water to “wash the dog”.On Monday the hottest point of Britain was St James’s Park in London, which reached 29.4C.The central London park was already holding the 2018 record having reached 29.1 on April 19.Meanwhile in Scotland, Achnagart in Ross and Cromarty boasted a temperature of 27.5C and the heat hit 25.3C in Castlederg in Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland.The sweltering sunshine sparked a large moor fire in Saddleworth, which could be seen 15 miles away in Manchester, with the blaze destroying two sheds and causing roads to be closed off.Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill described the heatwave as a “notable event” and “intense”.“Some people will enjoy it – but some won\u0027t,” he said.“A very prolonged spell of hot weather is starting.”Ancestry websites that tell you if you\u0026#39re a viking are \u0026#39complete bunkum\u0026#39, says expert in ancient DNAAirbus\u0026#39 threats to leave UK \u0026#39deserve to be listened to\u0026#39, Business Secretary tells MPsSupreme Court refuses to hear Making a Murderer caseInside the American Embassy, review – A riveting insight into diplomacy in the Trump eraMPs back Heathrow expansion but Boris predicts long delays for £14bn developmentNHS among worst in Western world at preventing avoidable deaths, study finds One in four children under two has their own tablet, MPs\u0026#39 report showsMinisters\u0026#39 demands for more money will mean higher taxes and leave Tories \u0026#39crushed\u0026#39 at election, warns Liz Truss Jam or cream first?

Mainstream games including Minecraft, Temple Run and Candy Crush already feature in under 5s’ top 10 apps.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreProfessor Livingstone, of the LSE who has advised the government, EU and national organisations on internet safety, said it was imperative social media and gaming firms did more to make the internet child-friendly “or at least not exploitative.”“My main concern is that the less responsibility industry takes, the more falls to children - and their parents and teachers - to figure out for themselves.“Faced with an increasingly complex, often opaque and illegible digital environment, the burden on children to anticipate and cope with online risks is often too great.“Digital media education cannot prepare all children, from any age and from all backgrounds, for some of the risks the internet industry serves up to them.”Baroness Kidron, founder of 5Rights, an organisation campaigning for children’s rights online, said: “The need for creative play is crucial for child development, specifically for the development of memory and imagination.The immersive environments accessed by tablets etc, are designed to be compulsive but ignore a child’s need for independent exploration, physical movement and inidual imagination. “Habits developed before nine require considerable intervention to change.  Yet a billion dollar industry intentionally designs digital services to be compulsive and then we reprimand children for being unable to put their devices down. The asymmetry of power is startling.”Tanya Goodin, founder of Time to Log off, a consultancy that advises schools and parents, said she was horrified by YouTube usage by under 4s: “YouTube is not a safe environment for children this age. Parents need to be better informed about the age limits for the software their children are using.“Schools are struggling to deal with inappropriate screen use in schools and this is only made harder when children arrive at the school gate at younger and younger ages with their own devices.”“Unless parents are prepared to sit and monitor everything their children are viewing on tablets at the very youngest ages then it’s completely inappropriate to give them screen-based devices so young.“It’s unfortunately part of a growing trend towards ‘digital babysitting’ where the child is given a screen to occupy themselves while the parent is busy with something else. We are creating big problems for ourselves as parents and as a society when we do this.”Ancestry websites that tell you if you\u0026#39re a viking are \u0026#39complete bunkum\u0026#39, says expert in ancient DNAAirbus\u0026#39 threats to leave UK \u0026#39deserve to be listened to\u0026#39, Business Secretary tells MPsSupreme Court refuses to hear Making a Murderer caseInside the American Embassy, review – A riveting insight into diplomacy in the Trump eraMPs back Heathrow expansion but Boris predicts long delays for £14bn developmentNHS among worst in Western world at preventing avoidable deaths, study finds Ministers\u0026#39 demands for more money will mean higher taxes and leave Tories \u0026#39crushed\u0026#39 at election, warns Liz Truss Jam or cream first?

information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is

Reports that the Government is set to reject plans for a tidal power lagoon in Swansea Bay have been greeted with anger in Wales.The £1.3bn Swansea Bay tidal lagoon has been rejected by the government, crushing hopes it would spark an “economic revolution” in Wales.Following 18 months of analysis, ministers have decided that the renewable energy project will not receive any subsidy support, despite independent experts stating that it would be a “no regrets policy”.Supporters hoped the initiative could be a pathfinder project that would pave the way for more tidal lagoons across the UK.However, business secretary Greg Clark told the House of Commons the project “however novel and appealing” did not demonstrate value for money for consumers and the general public.A report on the project released in January 2017 concluded that the project would bring huge benefits, and could be a highly cost-effective way of generating electricity.The report stated it was “beyond question” that the local economy would benefit, and that it would be cheaper than offshore wind.However, opponents of the scheme voiced concerns about the affordability of the technology, as well as its impact on the environment.Tidal Lagoon Power – the company behind the development – claimed the tidal lagoon’s turbines would have been capable of powering over 150,000 homes for around 120 years, but was in need of government subsidies similar to those given to nuclear developments to undertake its project.In the proposed development, a large U-shaped wall constructed in Swansea bay would be lined with turbines that generate electricity as they are driven by the rise and fall of the tide.The company claimed the\u0026nbspSwansea project would service more than 150,000 properties and it was cheaper than nuclear power.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

Tory Brexit would be a disaster for the prospects of a radical Labour government – it would deregulate and shrink the economy and attack working class people and migrants.“We cannot ignore that any longer – and many people who are not die-hard Remainers will be reaching the same conclusion.”\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded\u0027Mattha Busby and agenciesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopians at a rally in Addis Ababa in support of the new prime minister, Abiy AhmedAt least two people have been killed\u0026nbspand others injured following an explosion at a political rally in support of Ethiopia’s new reformist leader.In a televised address after the blast on Saturday, which eyewitnesses said was caused by a grenade, Abiy Ahmed described the incident as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.He said “a few people have lost their lives” and others were injured in the attack, that came shortly after he spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters on Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa. Mr Ahmed has not yet blamed anyone for the blast, nor has anyone claimed responsibility, and police are investigating.“Love always wins,” he said. “Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.” An Associated Press reporter said they saw more than a dozen injured people. Ethiopians have been heartened by a slew of reforms under Mr\u0026nbspAhmed and had come together in a show of support in numbers unseen in recent years in the east African nation. The rally has now broken up with people singing, chanting and going back to their homes. In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

To participate in the state’s primary you must have registered by 5 June. To vote in partisan races, voters had to register as a Democrat or Republican, but other party affiliated voters can cast ballots in nonpartisan races such as those for school boards.\u0026nbspPolling places can be looked up on the Board of Elections site.\u0026nbspThere are several online voting guides to help familiarise voters with issues before heading into the booth. A valid form of identification is required and can be in the form of a state driver’s license, state issued ID card, passport, student or military ID. A current utility bill or pay stub listing your name and address also works. Those without identification can request a provisional ballot, which will be counted once the information is verified. Incumbent Governor Larry Hogan is running for a second term at the helm this year. Though a Republican, he is considered a moderate and worked to put distance between himself and Donald Trump on issues like healthcare and gun control. His popularity is a pleasant surprise for a state that is considered to be largely Democrat and has voted that way for decades in presidential elections. Going against Mr Hogan are eight Democrats. Perhaps the best-known candidate is Ben Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People\u0026nbsp(NAACP). He has managed to get endorsement from Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and is seen as the progressive challenger to established Democrats in the state, part of a national movement this year to make the party more erse, inclusive, and less reliant on corporate contributions which wield influence. However, candidate Rushern Baker polled at a relatively close second. The official from Prince George’s county, which borders the eastern half of Washington DC, has won the endorsement of former Democratic Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and is seen as having closer ties to the establishment wing of the party. While Maryland is seen as a reliably blue\u0026nbspstate, there is one red\u0026nbspRepublican pocket and Democrats are looking to change that in voting booths along the Eastern Shore part of the state. Andy Harris has been the Republican Representative in the US House for eight years and has not faced a real challenge in that time. Unlike other parts of the state, the Eastern Shore is predominately white and voted for Mr Trump by 29 per cent in the 2016 election. What Mr Harris faces now is not just his vote against Obamacare, and that only 26 per cent of Maryland voters are registered Republicans, but also that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has made his seat a target and throwing political weight behind challengers like Jesse Colvin, a former Army intelligence officer, who has raised a large amount of money. Five other Democrats are challenging Mr Colvin for the nomination. The sixth Congressional district of the state, running from the suburbs of DC to the western border with Pennsylvania is an open US House seat - four Republicans and eight Democrats are vying for it. As far as Senate seats go, well-established Democratic Senator Ben Cardin is running for re-election. Mr Cardin is expected to win, taking 61 per cent in a recent poll, but is still being challenged by first-time candidate Chelsea Manning. The former US Army intelligence analyst who was convicted in 2013 for the largest leak of classified information in history moved to Rockville after Barack Obama commuted her sentence. Though\u0026nbspattention focused on her Senate bid, she has not been able to challenge Mr Cardin’s $4m in contributions and 30 years of experience. Voter turnout in primaries promises to be high across the board, but particularly for Democrats as tensions with Mr Trump and the Republicans grows every day. “Democrats are energised and they’re ready to send a message,” said Fabion Seaton, a spokesman for the Maryland Democratic Party, speaking to the Baltimore Sun. Early voting has seen a 55 per cent increase in turnout over the 2014 primaries, the last non-presidential election. As of last week, more than 170,000 voters had already cast early ballots, but experts warn this is not an indicator of winners since early voting is usually pushed far more by Democrats than Republicans.After the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration failed to send updated voter rolls to the Board of Elections, almost 19,000 voters are required to fill out provisional ballots in order to participate in the primaries. The agencies called it a “computer programming error” affecting any voters who updated their addresses between 22 April 2017 and 5 June 2018, as the Washington Post reported.In total 18,700 changed their addresses and 7,300 changed their party affiliation. There are efforts to contact all voters impacted by the error, but concerns were raised since the problem was discovered only three days before the primary.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An existing\u0026nbspstate of emergency, they\u0026nbspstressed, also limited freedom of expression and assembly for political parties.The delegation from the\u0026nbspOrganisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)\u0026nbspcomplained that some monitors were obstructed in carrying out their work. Ignacio\u0026nbspSanchez Amor, the group’s special coordinator, said it was “utterly unacceptable” that two members of the team were denied entry into the country.Election in Turkey: the reaction in picturesSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultMr Erdogan described the election process as “an example to the rest of the world”. In his victory speech he returned to a recurring theme in his campaign: that he was the leader to\u0026nbspstand up for Turkey against western powers. “We never bow down in front of anyone except God, you have given a lesson to those who want for Turkey to kneel,” he told his cheering followers. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.”Foreign interference and sabotage had been blamed by Mr Erdogan and his supporters for a range of the country’s ills, including the plummeting national currency, the Lira. The president, who had said he would play a key role in forming economic policy in his new administration, declared that vast infrastructure developments\u0026nbspbeing undertaken will lead to massive boosts in employment and growth. The projects include Kanal Istanbul, a 45 kilometre channel linking the Black and Marmara\u0026nbspseas and the airport to replace Istanbul’s Ataturk, provisionally named the New Istanbul Airport, but, it is claimed in local media, which may end up being called\u0026nbspErdogan Airport.The conflicts\u0026nbspagainst Kurdish militants home and abroad are set to continue,\u0026nbspwith new operations planned. The mission was to “fight terrorist organisations” and\u0026nbsp“to continue the fight to make Syrian grounds freer”, Mr Erdogan said. Fresh offensives are also expected to be launched against Kurdish fighters in the southeast of the country. “Our flag will flutter more freely, the peace of every citizen will be advanced,” the president\u0026nbspsaid. “One nation, one flag, one country, one state.”Erdogan proclaimed winner of Turkey’s presidential electionThe pro-Kurdish\u0026nbspPeoples’\u0026nbspDemocratic Party (HDP)\u0026nbspbroke through the 10 per cent barrier in the elections and so\u0026nbspwill have a significant number of MPs in parliament. Nine of its newly elected MPs, including the leader, Selahattin Demirtas, have been imprisoned.\u0026nbspThe HDP\u0026nbspgains\u0026nbspwere expected to make the opposition groups the majority in parliament,\u0026nbspbut Mr Erdogan’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party did better than expected as did its allies, the far-right\u0026nbspNationalist\u0026nbspAction Party\u0026nbspwho secured\u0026nbspdouble the support polls had forecast. This means the ruling coalition will keep control.The election wins\u0026nbspkeep 64-year-old Mr Erdogan in office until 2023, the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. He can then, under the new constitution, run for another term as president, and one more if he were to call an early election. Thus\u0026nbspallowing him to stay president, theoretically, until 2032, easily surpassing the tenure of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.During\u0026nbspthe election campaign Mr Erdogan had mooted that the state of emergency, brought in following the failed coup blamed on exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, would be lifted. More than 50,000 people remain in prison and another 140,000 have been suspended or fired from their jobs.Turkey’s democracy isn’t over yet, but it will be soonErdogan declared winner of Turkey\u0027s presidential electionSix arrested for ‘insulting Erdogan’ as polls open in Turkey electionsThe president has not given a timeframe for the easing of the punitive measures or any indication on whether they would be lifted totally.\u0026nbspHis new powers, in any event, allow\u0026nbsphim to impose draconian measures with minimal interference from the judiciary.There were some among opposition supporters who would rather not wait to see whether there would be an outbreak of benevolence from the president after his victory.Adem Bulent, a 20-year-old student and CHP supporter, said he has begun to explore whether he can finish his studies abroad. It was not just the defeat which disappointed him, but the way the political parties accepted it. “They talked about how unfair it was, they talked about vote rigging, then this happens against all the expectations, and then –\u0026nbspnothing,” he said, waving\u0026nbsphis arms in exasperation. “I think the chance has come and gone, there is no point in pretending otherwise.”The extent of the gloom felt by those who expected change\u0026nbspwas expressed by an academic staring into his coffee on Monday morning at a cafe in Istanbul’s fashionable Nisantasi district. Suleiman had stayed up\u0026nbspmost of the night in front of the television with the forlorn hope of the figures changing. “Just how bad was it? Well let’s say for us it was Trump and Brexit rolled into one, that’s how bad it was,”\u0026nbspwas his damning verdict.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I feel like I can do anything,” Bayan al Soumady says over the phone from Riyadh. The excitement in her voice is infectious.\u0026nbsp“I drove myself to work today.\u0026nbspMaybe it’s just a little thing, but everything feels like an adventure now.”The 24-year-old pharmacist is one of thousands of women across Saudi Arabia who took to the road for the first time on Sunday after the kingdom abolished its long-standing ban on women driving.\u0026nbspAs the clock struck midnight, in a show of solidarity and celebration, women did victory laps around the centres of Riyadh, Jeddah and\u0026nbspDammam,\u0026nbsptrailed by Saudi television crews and the rest of the world’s media.Throughout Sunday – the first day of the Saudi working week – women who had already managed to convert their foreign driving licences\u0026nbspstepped into newly purchased cars, or borrowed those belonging to fathers and husbands, to commute to work and run errands alone. Some headed out of the cities on the long, straight desert roads to drive fast for the pleasure of it.\u0026nbsp“Life can feel very complicated here sometimes,” says\u0026nbspBayan, who is half Syrian and learned to drive while\u0026nbspstudying in Damascus.\u0026nbsp“It’s frustrating not being able to rely on yourself for simple things like going to the supermarket 10 minutes away. I know it doesn’t fix everything – but being able to drive is a big step,” she adds.The historic moment gives women unprecedented freedom in a country where the male ship system effectively renders them second-class citizens, unable to make many important decisions for themselves.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia’s tiny activist community has fought against the ban since it was enforced by police and licensing agencies in 1990. A surprise royal decree from King Salman last September, however,\u0026nbspannounced the end of a policy which has been perhaps the foremost symbol of the oppression faced by women in the conservative kingdom. The move, designed to help get more\u0026nbspwomen into the Saudi workforce, is part of a raft of wide-ranging social and economic reforms installed by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\u0026nbspin the year since his appointment.\u0026nbspSaudi Women celebrate their freedom to driveA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTo hammer home the message that change in Saudi Arabia comes from the top down, in the weeks leading up to the lifting of the ban 17 prominent activists have been arrested. Eight are still being held without access to their families or lawyers, and no charges have been brought against them.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, many ordinary Saudis embraced what one national newspaper called “history in the making”. \u0026nbsp“The logistics of half a country suddenly being able to learn to drive are quite something,” Susan Newbon, a British driving instructor training Saudi women to teach their own students, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s a very strange but very important occasion.”\u0026nbspSome women will have to wait a while to get behind the wheel\u0026nbspthere are huge waiting lists for gender-segregated lessons across the country, and a course of classes can cost hundreds of dollars. That is an extravagant expense in a country where households are tightening the purse strings following a global plunge in oil prices and amid national austerity measures.\u0026nbspLSE Saudi Arabia academic: Lifting ban on women driving is being used to deflect bad newsLearning to drive will also still depend on the goodwill of husbands, fathers or sons – meaning women from conservative families will not be enjoying their new right yet.\u0026nbspOn Sunday, at least, the mood across the country was jubilant, with “tawakkali wa intaliqi”, or “have faith and drive”, celebratory events taking place across the kingdom.\u0026nbsp“I’ve been using my husband’s car today,” Bayan says. “But I’m going to get my own as soon as possible.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup? We’re just about managing to keep our chins up.Let’s hope Harry Kane and our boys can show them how it’s done tomorrow.Do us proud, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

If you’re able, ask if your friends, family or neighbours need any support.”The Met Office warning said: “There is an 80 per cent chance of heatwaves conditions between 9am on Tuesday and 6pm on Thursday in parts of England.“Heatwaves can be dangerous, especially for the very young or very old or those with chronic disease.”Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the Met Office, told The Sun Online that London is likely to be the hottest part of the UK this week.He said: “We could see 30C in London on Thursday which would make it the hottest day of the year so far.“Even in the evenings we could see temperatures hitting 14C so it is important to keep cool at night, too.“If people know they are vulnerable to the heat they should limit the number of outdoor exercises they are doing and think about ways to keep hydrated.“Pollen will remain high, if you have asthma, it could create health problems for some.“There’s a slight myth that everyone looks forward to the hot weather, but that is not always the case.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389985792.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how cornish pasties and scotch whisky could end up sinking post brexit trade deal with us","story":"Trade Secretary Liam Fox has written to David Davis demanding him to stand up to Brussels and diverge from the EUs protected status food so we can do a deal with America after Brexit.The UK has 83 protected food and drinks, which means that food made outside of that area cant be marketed in the same way.Across Europe there are 3,300 other types of protected goods - such as French champagne, Greek feta, or Parma Ham - all of which the US produces its own versions of.Brussels boss Michel Barnier says the issue is non negotiable and we MUST recognise the special status of all the foods after we leave before we start talking about a trade deal.But Dr Fox has said we have to be able to go it alone and diverge from the bloc after warnings from Donald Trumps ally Paul Ryan, the  reported.The regulations also protect other traditional foods including Stornoway black pudding, Fenland celery, Cumberland sausages and Whitstable oysters.During a recent visit to the US he was told by the senior Republican and Speaker of the House of Representatives that the UK must be able to diverge from the EU protected status to secure a deal.Britain has already been told to allow imports of GM foods and chlorinated chicken in order to cut a better deal.Earlier this year Danish exporters were caught illegally selling cheese as feta overseas - in a long-running dairy battle.It can only be labelled as such if its made in Greece using sheep milk.But the Danes use cow milk and its far less crumbly.Theresa May has said she hoped to sign a speedy deal with the US as soon as we leave the bloc.But any deal with the EU could have an effect on negotiations with the Americans.A Government spokesman said: Leaving the EU gives us a golden opportunity to secure ambitious free-trade deals that are in the mutual interests of the countries involved while supporting farmers and producers to grow and sell more great British food.We will ensure consumers continue to have a range of high-quality food products. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the state is the answer to everything.Mr Lidington said ending outsourcing would bring about the biggest wave of re-nationalisation since the dark days of the 1970s.He suggested the plans would also see a repeat of the days when the state owned the Gleneagles golf course, Thomas Cook and all the pubs in Carlisle, before starting to sell them off in the 70s.And he estimated the overall cost in increased taxes to be around £6,000 per household - a total of £176billion.Mr Lidington insisted the economies of scale and specialist skills which outsourcing allows mean public services can be provided cheaper than by the Government.Labours policy, introduced after Carillion went into liquidation, is to ban all outsourcing except when its absolutely necessary.The party would force councils and Government departments to bid against private firms for services contracts, and only allow companies to take over projects which are shown to be failing.Labour also wants to stop civil servants from choosing a bid just because its the cheapest for the taxpayer.Mr Corbyn accuses outsourcing firms such as Carillion of fleecing the state by making profit from public service contracts."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004159803131.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn snubs armed forces day again and sends colleague in his place","story":"Theresa May and Gavin Williamson are set to attend the event in Wales to celebrate Britains army, navy and other forces.Now in its 10th year, the day will see more than 300 events across the UK, with many of the countrys 2.5million veterans there too.But Mr Corbyn wont be in attendance again this year.Labour sources confirmed that Mr Corbyn will attend an NHS march in central London on Saturday to mark 70 years of Britains health service.Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith will attend the Llandudno event instead.But there are at least two other armed forces events in the central London area, the official Armed Forces Day event website confirms.Government defence minister Guto Bebb, along with Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns are also scheduled to come to the main event in North Wales.Tonight Tory party deputy chairman James Cleverly blasted Mr Corbyn’s decision to swerve the event again as proof of his “long term ambivalence to our service personnel.”The former Army officer said: “Supporting the NHS is incredibly important, but on one of the days of the year where we specifically honour our Armed Forces it surely could have been possible to thank them.”Mr Corbyn wasnt at last years event as he took to the stage in Glastonbury.Crowds chanted the Labour leaders name ahead of his appearance at the leftie festival.The Labour leader spoke on for 20 minutes on the Pyramid Stage before introducing hip hop act Run The Jewels while PM Theresa May joined hundreds of military personnel in Liverpool.Corbs further snubbed veterans by posting a photo to mark Armed Forces Day -

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And things then got a bit out of hand and the surprises got more and more surprising.Brian built a stone folly to link the fernery to the oriental garden and we turned on old underground air raid shelter into a shell grotto, with the entrance hidden behind a gothic summerhouse.The sunny borders near the house are all colour themed and the paved terrace was reorganised with an open veranda, raised lion’s head fountain and lots of pots and hanging baskets.There was lots of trial and error, both in terms of design and planting, but we just learnt as we went along and changed the things that didn’t work.The couple have found a clever way to water the garden by installing large, hidden water tanks, which collect rain water off the roof and distribute it through leaky hoses snaking down the borders.But Anne admitted the garden still took hours of pruning and deadheading each day.She said: We are such plantaholics that the beds are stuffed with plants, so there is no room for weeds, but we have to do a lot of refereeing, to save the shyer plants from the bullies.Managing the trees, so they don’t overwhelm the garden, also requires constant vigilance, as does the ongoing battle with slugs and snails.One visitor said ours was a Tardis garden – bigger on the inside than the outside and another even claimed to be lost once.We wanted to create a garden that has something unexpected around each corner and we seemed to have done that."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416030480.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"speaker refuses to resign from job","story":"He has faced growing calls to stand down since he was accused of bullying by two of his former aides.And he was overheard calling Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom a “stupid woman”.It sparked furious calls for him to stick by his original promise of only serving until June 22 this year.

We look at what that would mean.This particular ban means a restriction on the use of hosepipes during a water shortage.Hosepipes, or hoses, are connected to a water tap and are used to spray gardens and wash cars.The ban usually comes into effect during a period of high temperatures and low rainfall, sparking fears of a drought.No there isn’t one in place at the moment, and we didn’t see one in 2017 either.However, bookies say the likelihood of a ban coming into effect is just 7-4, as little or no rain is forecast for the coming weeks.If one is imposed, it will likely be across the south of England, where ground water levels are below average at present.Under previous hosepipe and sprinkler bans the use of watering cans, buckets and other water carrying devices has been perfectly acceptable for watering the garden, or for instance washing your car.During a ban you should always check with your local water company to see the specific rules they have in place of course.It has also been generally accepted by the water companies in the past that a short piece of hose connected to a tap can be used to fill the watering can/bucket – meaning you’re technically using one!However, the whole point of banning hosepipes and sprinklers is that they will tend to be left on for long periods of time and use up large amounts of water.The hosepipe ban does not stop you watering your plants but the way you water them has to be altered.By forcing you to use a watering can or bucket, it helps reduce the risk of using too much water overall.​"},{"url":null,"title":"first picture showjumper unknown substance devon","story":"The young girl who died has been named locally as talented showjumper Hannah Bragg, 15, of Tavistock, Devon.A 14-year-old boy who was discovered with Hannah remains in a critical condition.On Monday, dozens of schoolchildren in uniform gathered for a vigil in the woods, just metres from when Hannah was taken ill.They sang songs and tearfully hugged each in front of a shrine of flowers that has been created for Hannah.There were also tributes and flowers left on the entrance to the coastal path.One note read: To the most beautiful angel in the sky, me and Harry are going to miss you so much.Harry will grow up knowing his auntie was a beautiful, kind hearted girl. Night night Hannah, Love Harry and Hannah. Another read: Dear Hannah, You have always been the epitome of beauty and kindness.

The headteacher of Tavistock College, where Hannah was a year ten pupil also paid tribute.In a letter to parents Sarah Jones said: It is with great sadness that I inform you of the death at the weekend of a well loved Year 10 student at the college. The young lady was a bright, caring and thoughtful girl, who was always seen with a smile on her face and had an eagerness for taking part in all aspects of school life.We are devastated at this loss and send sincere condolences to her family and close friends. Paying tribute to the teen, Julia Bassett of the East Cornwall Hunt Pony Club - of which Hannah was a member - said Hannahs mother Karen Bragg had requested people to share their memories of her daughter online.She said: I am sure by now that most of you will have heard about the tragic and incredibly sad news relating to Hannah Bragg.Hannah had been a member of ECHPC for a number of years and was always polite and kind and did well in representing the club in a number of disciplines, most recently by being in team at Lyneham house.She continued: Hannah was a regular attendee and supporter of rallies with her lovely pony Micky. Hannah was awarded the clubs most improved rider award in 2016 for all the hard work she put into producing her pony from the cheeky chap he was when they first joined to the fantastic all rounder he turned into, which was very well deserved.I am sure you will all join us in sending our condolences to Hannahs family at this heartbreaking time.The club will be sending some flowers, but we feel it appropriate to hold a collection and also to run a fundraiser so a donation can be made to the Cornwall air ambulance service, who attended to Hannah on that fateful day.Jo Goulden Jones said: I cant even begin to comprehend how cruel life can be. Lucie and I were both saddened and shocked last night. Such a beautiful life to tragically cut short. Penny Redwood-Smith added: Absolutely tragic news.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They didn\u0027t address the problems or find solutions.:: EU leaders hold \u0027frank and open\u0027 talks at emergency migration summitEurope\u0027s migration policy doesn\u0027t work - the asylum burden remains on frontier countries like Italy and Greece to take the strain. And the returns policy doesn\u0027t work - failed asylum seekers (economic migrants) are not being returned home - either because their home country won\u0027t take them or because the EU country they are in fails to deport them often it\u0027s both.So they are left to live in an unpleasant illegal limbo.I am in touch with a number of people who I met through the years as I\u0027ve reported on migration.They have repeatedly been rejected for asylum and yet they are still here, trying again. The \u0027populist\u0027 and anti-establishment governments who secured power because of the 2015 failures have now politicised the issue and are forcing fundamental change.The paradox being that while the optics are of boatloads still arriving, the figures show that arrivals are a fraction of the number they were.This has caused ructions all over the place: :: Germany:: The Italian \u0027populists\u0027France and Italy have been lobbing insults at each other over the migrant issue. It\u0027s extremely unusual for two such central players in the EU to be at loggerheads.It\u0027s a useful demonstration of how the Italian \u0027populists\u0027 roll and it\u0027s playbook-Trump stuff.The two men who call the shots in Rome - Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Miao, the figureheads of the two coalition parties and both now deputy prime ministers - used their vast social media presence to appeal to their support base by denouncing the what they termed the arrogance of the French president (who had dared to suggest that the migration crisis was largely a political row rather than an actual crisis).An aside: Emmanuel Macron cast himself as anti-establishment when he won the presidency just over a year ago (was it only a year ago!?). Now he feels firmly establishment and up against the real mavericks in Italy. :: The migrants on the MedAn ever-growing number of charity rescue ships are stacking up in the Mediterranean with hundreds of rescued migrants on board waiting for a country to accept them.Italy and Malta are essentially playing chicken with them: each country holding the line not accepting the boats until an imminent danger to life forces them to.It\u0027s tough, reckless, maybe even illegal but, frankly, it\u0027s been effective in forcing the issue onto the table at EU level.Italy has made it clear that it isn\u0027t willing to deal with this issue alone.This short film which we made 18 months ago is an attempt to explain what\u0027s happening on the Med - nothing\u0027s changed since we filmed it. Watch it below. The discussion at EU leader level seems to be going round in circles. They are talking this week about issues they were talking about three years ago: \u0027hotspots\u0027 to process asylum seekers, asylum centers outside the EU, beefing up the external borders.There is no single solution and any discussion must begin with an acceptance that you can\u0027t stop migration.

The MP famously declared he would serve only for nine years when he first took the Speaker\u0027s chair on 22 June 2009. But that period expired on Friday - and now Mr Bercow, who has faced bullying claims that he denies, has confirmed he\u0027s here to stay. He told a reception in his grand official residence: Notwithstanding occasional rumours to the contrary, I have got absolutely no intention of going anywhere.  Mr Bercow\u0027s original pledge was in a letter ahead of his election as speaker. He wrote: I believe strongly that the post of Speaker should not be a job for life but an opportunity to make a difference within a reasonable period of time. If you do me the honour of electing me, I will serve for no longer than two full parliaments and, in any event, for no more than 9 years in total. Mr Bercow had already abandoned the nine-year commitment ahead of the 2017 snap election, saying he wanted to serve a full term to 2022. However, allegations of bullying by former members of his staff - denied by the Speaker - led to fresh calls for him to quit.

The party plans to try to ban a practice where greedy utility giants lure customers with cheap or loss-leading tariffs before rolling them onto expensive Standard Variable Tariffs. It is tabling an amendment to the Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill when peers debate it in the Lords on Wednesday. Insiders have dubbed it the “price and prejudice” amendment because it disproportionately affects elderly and poorer households, who are less likely to switch providers. Labour’s Energy spokesman Lord Grantchester said: “For far too long, too many households in Britain have paid over the odds for gas and electricity. “Teased to switch provider through a chance to cut energy costs, they soon find themselves being squeezed back once the deal ends. “Worse still, it’s the elderly, disabled, and those on low incomes on the receiving end of this rip-off treatment and they are effectively subsidising more internet-savvy switchers.  “The relative price cap Labour is proposing looks to put an end to these practices and the prejudice that comes with it.” A report by the Competition and Markets Authority found that customers had paid \u0026pound1.4billion a year in excessive prices between 2012 and 2015. Those customers on SVTs - about seven out of 10 families - were paying 11% more for electricity and 15% more for gas than those on other tariffs. Some energy companies offer attractive teaser prices to attract new customers who believe switching will save them cash. However, when a fixed period runs out they are moved onto considerably higher SVTS.

The company behind the scheme, Tidal Lagoon Power, wanted subsidies similar to those for new nuclear power to build the \u0026pound1.3 billion scheme, consisting of a U-shaped sea wall with turbines in Swansea Bay. The lagoon had been backed as a pathfinder project to develop the tidal technology by an independent review for the Government. But Business Secretary Greg Clark told the House of Commons the project however novel and appealing did not demonstrate value for money for consumers and the public purse. The announcement came just hours before MPs were expected to back the expansion of Heathrow Airport, which campaigners claim will cause an environmental disaster. Liz Saville Roberts MP, Plaid Cymru\u0027s energy spokeswoman at Westminster, said: Every single party represented in the National Assembly has backed the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and yet, Westminster has told us we can\u0027t do it.  It is a sorry state of affairs that our national parliament can be so wilfully overruled by a Westminster Government over the border, for whom the people of Wales did not vote. Wales\u0027s coastline is an untapped resource. The tidal lagoon would have been a first step towards making Wales a world leader in a new and innovative technology with the potential to power our future. Westminster is refusing to invest to create well-paid jobs in Wales, while at the same time threatening the ones which already exist, through its irresponsible stance on Brexit. This latest block on Wales\u0027 future is a perfect demonstration of the need for Wales to gain greater control over its own future. We cannot continue to allow our country to be held back by Westminster.  Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, responding to the Government\u0027s decision not to support the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, said: Once again the Tories have defied all logic and failed to make the right decision for our economy, the people of Wales and the future of our planet. Scrapping the Tidal Lagoon on the same day as supporting a third runway at Heathrow is a kick in the teeth not only for Wales but for the renewables sector and industries outside the capital. Thousands of workers will now miss out on high-quality employment and thousands of households will miss out on the benefits of zero-carbon energy. If Theresa May was serious about rebalancing our economy, creating jobs and protecting British communities from climate change then she would not have made this decision. The next Labour government will back low-carbon projects like the Swansea Tidal Lagoon, supporting manufacturing, creating jobs and working to meet our climate targets.

Lewis Barkley, 11, was with two pals in a playground when the animals pounced. The terrified youngsters scrambled up a fence to try and escape. But Lewis was dragged to the floor by the ferocious terriers and mauled on the legs and arms, face and back. He had surgery on his wounds today and his parents, Kirsty and Joshua, are now at his hospital bedside.  Police said the youngster is in “a serious, but not life-threatening, condition”. His uncle, Richie Shields, 35, said: “His dad showed me a picture of Lewis last night and it looked like he’d been clawed by a bear. “There was a gash on the back of his leg. He has bites and scratches on his hand and chest. The dogs just went for him.” Mr Shields said his nephew was with two friends in the park on Sunday when two dogs, one a pitbull type and one a Staffordshire bull terrier, raced towards them. Lewis was rushed to Liverpool’s Alder Hey Hospital, pouring with blood.  His uncle added: “They said if one of the injuries to his face had been a couple of centimetres lower it would have got an artery and would have killed him. “His mum Kirsty and dad Joshua are really upset and angry, they’ve been by his bedside. Lewis was attacked near his home in Speke, Merseyside. His dad Josh Shields said this evening: “He’s been bitten on the left side of his face, they bit a hole through his ear, there was a bite on his chest and on his arm.  “They shredded his thighs. There are cuts all over his thighs. “There was also a bite on his backside and his testicles. “His face is swollen and bruised, there was a bite on his face near his jaw. He added: “If that would have been a couple of centimetres lower we would be a in a different position today. “Someone said it looks like a bear attacked him and that’s how I would describe it. “He’s all stitched up and bandaged up now. “They’ve cleaned all the wounds up and given him a course of antibiotics and have taken swabs from all of his wounds to see if there’s any infection. “They’re going to monitor him over the next 24 hours and give him fluids.”  Mr Shields said Lewis, who has three siblings Harry, six, Josh, seven, and Jessie, one, had been playing football with friends on the field which is a short walk from his house. He continued: “I got a phone call to say he’s been bitten by a dog and that he was in hospital. “It was horrible and horrendous. I can’t put it into words what it was like seeing him for the first time. His brothers and sister are inconsolable. “He told me he thought he was going to die. “The man who helped Lewis – he saved his life and we can’t thank him enough. We don’t know how we’ll every repay him. “This was two pitbull-type dogs against an 11-year-old child.  “Lewis does boxing and is fit and healthy. He told me he kicked the dog in the head and that’s the last thing he can remember. “We’re celebrating his birthday in a couple of weeks and as his mum said instead of planning a birthday party we could have been planning his funeral.” Gary Gaze, 47, was at a family barbecue in a garden backing onto the park when he heard screaming. The airport worker scaled a fence and sprinted towards the blood-soaked boy, who was covered in bite marks, and tried to comfort him as he lay injured. Dad-of-one Gary said: “I heard unusual screams. They didn’t sound like kids playing.  “I jumped up the fence and saw two dogs – pitbull types – on this lad and he was just screaming ‘get them off’.” “The lad was traumatised, he had blood coming out of everywhere and was shaking. “He had blood coming from a gaping wound on his leg and chest but the one I was most worried about was at the back of his leg which was about three or four inches. “I was trying to take his attention away from it. He kept saying ‘why did the dogs have to do that?’ And he was asking me if he was going to die so I just tried to reassure him. “The police came and made the decision to take him to hospital so I went in the car with him.  “He was in shock and I knew it was important to keep him awake so I kept talking to him about football and about Mo Saleh and told him I would buy him some new trainers. I was trying to distract him. “His mum was already at the hospital and when she saw him she just started screaming.” He added: “I just cuddled him and got him to safety. He thought he was going to die - he kept saying he wanted his dad. “I said ‘Mate, you are not going to die, I’m going all the way with you here’.” Related video - Devastating moment pit bull attacks and kills small dog as it leaves apartment with owner   "},{"url":null,"title":"brit model chloe ayling says","story":"NewsBrit model Chloe Ayling says she was \u0027willing to have sex\u0027 with kidnapper Lukaz Herba in order to escape himPoland-born Lukasz Herba was convicted of kidnapping the glamour model and was sentenced to serve 16 years\u0026nbspShareByNeil Murphy00:49, 26 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe model at the centre of a daring kidnapping plot says she has been “vindicated” after her abductor was handed a lengthy prison sentence. Chloe Ayling, 21, hit the headlines last year after the lurid conspiracy to sell her as a sex slave on the dark web was revealed to a sceptical British public. Chloe, from Coulsdon in south London, has revealed further shocking details about her ordeal - and claimed she was even willing to have sex with her tormentor to stay alive. In an interview with The Sun, she said: “I thought I might have to sleep with him to survive. “My only move to get out of there alive was to get him to like me.” Lukasz Herba, from Poland, was found guilty of abducting the glamour model in July of last year and was order to serve 16 year jail sentence by an Italian court. During the trial it emerged that Herba had become obsessed with Chloe after he discovered her photographs on Facebook. Chloe has described her relief that Herba is now behind bars and says she is overjoyed that doubts about her story have now been dismissed.  She said: “It’s a huge relief because I feel like my life has been on hold. “It was six days of hell — and then I had to deal with all the disbelief once I got home. I feel happy now that everyone knows I was telling the truth.” Chloe’s five-day ordeal began after she was lured to a fake photoshoot in Milan which had been organised by Herba and his accomplice. Upon arrival, she says she was injected with ketamine by a masked man and was taken to a farmhouse near Turin after being stuffed inside a suitcase.  She said: “Suddenly this man has his hand on my mouth — covering my nose. “And then another man ran in front of me with a mask on. I saw he had a syringe. “When I woke up I was so drugged. Slowly as I regained \u0026shyconsciousness, I realised I was in the back of a car. “I had no idea why they were \u0026shytaking me. Everything went through my head — are they going to rape me? Are they going to kill me?” Herba, 30, claimed that Ayling had been part of the elaborate plot and had gone along with it to help boost her profile. CCTV footage of the pair holding hands while shopping for clothes cast further doubts about about her story.  Mother-of-one Chloe says she had was forced to go along with Herba’s demands out of fear that she would be killed and was freed after she convinced him to release her to the the UK consulate. “He told me we were going shoe shopping because I’d need shoes to walk to the consulate in Milan when he released me. “When he asked to kiss me I didn’t say no. I didn’t want to upset him. Instead I would say, ‘Maybe in the future.’ “He asked me to hold hands and I was hardly going to say no. He had so much power over me. “He was never violent but he would often show me his knife as a veiled threat. I knew not to mess with him. “I \u0026shydiscovered he had been trying to create ricin and cyanide at home before the kidnapping. “Imagine if I’d done something differently — it could have ended very badly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside filthy squat 35 people","story":"NewsInside filthy squat where 35 people were living in three bedrooms as illegal landlord is jailedMattresses were decked from wall to wall in the property, which Ilie Florin Dragusin and two others had converted into an unlicensed HMO\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLaura Sharman19:51, 25 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe dirty, cramped conditions where 35 men were crammed into a squat have been revealed as its illegal landlord was jailed. Mattresses were decked from wall to wall in the tiny three-bed property, which Ilie Florin Dragusin and two other head tenants had converted into an unlicensed HMO (House of Multiple Occupancy). The men were crammed into every part of the home - including the kitchen and back garden - and officers found a sleeping area under a canopy in the garden with no protection against the cold. Callous Dragusin was reported to the council after he put the men and their belongings onto the street as the property was raided by a council enforcement team.  Officers from Brent Council had first visited the property in Kingsbury, northwest in September, amid reports the house was being illegally sub-let. Dragusin was one of three head tenants fined a total of \u0026pound29,000 after enforcement officers discovered eight men sleeping in one room living in squalid conditions. Brent Council ordered Dragusin not to change the locks as the local authority tried to rehome the men but the callous sub-letter bolted the tenants out of the house and threw their belongings into the street while they were out.  Dragusin has now been jailed for unlawful eviction after ignoring four warnings by enforcement officers not to change the locks on the property. Eleanor Southwood, housing chief for Brent council, said: This custodial sentence sends a strong message to anyone thinking that they can get away with illegally evicting their tenants - the punishment is prison. “We will help people in the private rented sector who are suffering from the actions of rogue landlords, subletters and agents.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton could new title","story":"NewsKate Middleton could get a new title when the Queen dies - and it will be extremely specialPrince William will get a brand new title when the Queen passes away, and there\u0027s a good chance Kate Middleton will take it too\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer14:19, 25 JUN 2018Updated23:30, 25 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen she married her prince back on 2011 Kate Middleton became the Duchess of Cambridge. Along with Prince William, the couple have been known by their official titles ever since, and their children George, Charlotte and Louis have also taken on their title. But like many other things in the royal family, this will change when the Queen dies . William and Kate will get new titles to represent them moving up the line of succession.  At the moment, Prince Charles is the Prince of Wales. This title isn\u0027t just his, it\u0027s the title which is traditionally given to the heir to the throne and Charles is the 21st man to be given it. Diana became the Princess of Wales after she married Charles in 1981. Technically, Camilla should now have the title but she turned it down out of respect for Diana. But after the Queen\u0027s death and Prince Charles becomes king, Prince William will become the Prince of Wales and Kate will probably be offered the title of Princess of Wales.  It probably wouldn\u0027t have gone down well with the public if Camilla took the title, but it\u0027s a very different situation with Kate. She might decide she wants to use the name as a tribute to the mother-in-law she never met. Until Wills, Prince Harry won\u0027t get a new title when his grandmother dies as he is much further down the line of succession. When he married Meghan Markle earlier this year, the Queen gave them the titles the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Even though the Duke title has been used before, Meghan is the first Duchess of Sussex because of a rather upsetting course of events surrounding the original.  The original was Prince Augustus Frederick, the son of George III born in 1773. He was university educated and campaigned for the abolition of slavery.

The RSPCA were called to assist officers who were probing the unexplained death of a woman in April last year. The animal charity were first told there were around 30 dogs - but when inspectors arrived they were shocked find a staggering 82 chihuahuas inside. The pooches filled every corner of the filthy and cramped house in Birmingham - including behind kitchen appliances, and had matted coats, fleas and burns.  The dogs were believed to have descended from just one couple - Blue and Tinkerbell - four years ago. As a result of inbreeding, some had serious behavioural issues and were extremely aggressive and unhappy. RSPCA inspector Herchy Boal said: “The officers asked us for help with around 30 dogs but I was busy dealing with another emergency elsewhere. “When they called me again a few hours later they were extremely concerned about the conditions they had found the dogs in, claiming they believed there were actually in excess of 40 small breeds. “When I arrived at the property I found 82 dogs inside.  They literally started appearing from everywhere. We would move the washing machine and suddenly there’d be six faces looking at you. It was incredible where they were able to hide. “The house looked like an earthquake had hit it, everything was higgledy piggledy, it was really chaotic and dirty. “We called out a vet who said the house was too hazardous and the dogs couldn’t stay there, it was filthy and cramped. They were all hiding - barking and snapping at us.” West Midlands Police had launched an investigation after a woman who lived at the property died.  But following their enquiries, they established that there were no suspicious circumstances and that she had died from complications after an accident. All 82 dogs were removed and taken to the charity’s Newbrook Farm Animal Hospital in Birmingham. Staff worked through the night to check over all of the dogs and ensure they received necessary treatment. Inspector Boal said: “We didn’t finish work until 11am the next day. “The woman and her husband, Stephen, had started out with two pet chihuahuas - Blue and Tinkerbell. Unfortunately, they didn’t get their dogs neutered and four years later, they had 82 dogs.  “This was a classic hoarding situation but it was clear the couple had loved their dogs and things had simply got out of hand. “We worked with Stephen to renovate and clean the home while we cared for the dogs. We returned four of the dogs to him and re-homed the rest. “Two of the dogs that went back to Stephen had serious behavioural issues and were extremely aggressive and unhappy. But when we returned them to him they were like different dogs and were so much happier. “This was a really sad case but it was also a really memorable one for me due to the sheer number of dogs involved.  “I really hope we can use this story to make it clear why it’s so important to neuter your pets not only to avoid unwanted litters but also to avoid inbreeding which can result in serious health and behaviour problems in puppies. Multiple dog households are very challenging, and with this job, I had no idea how many dogs I was taking out. They literally started appearing from absolutely everywhere. We\u0027d move the washing machine and suddenly there would be six faces looking at you and it was just incredible where they were able to hide.

Toddler Aaron Cadder was playing in his grandmother\u0027s kitchen when he got hold of the dangerous product and spilt it on his legs, reported the Daily Record.  The corrosive liquid - which is available to buy at supermarkets - soaked through the two-year-old\u0027s trousers causing him to suffer serious burns and a frightening allergic reaction. Mum Paula said when she first saw Aaron in hospital it looked like his face had melted and thought his little one would be left blind.  Paula, 25, from Glasgow , said: “He was in so much pain and never left my side afterwards.   “He looked like an acid attack victim.      “It’s just unimaginable that such a common household product could do so much damage.   “Thankfully Aaron has made a full recovery but he has been left scarred for life.”   Paula, who also has a daughter Kelsey, seven, says her partner Peter, 28, a construction worker, took Aaron for a haircut before heading over to his mum’s house in December last year.  Aaron and his gran Margaret, 63, are extremely close and he stays over once a week.  Paula, a full-time mum, said: “Margaret had been cleaning the oven when Peter and Aaron popped round, so she put the bottle back in the cupboard.      “Then she left the room for a couple of seconds to pop some washing on when Aaron came running after her screaming.   “His little face was red and swollen. When she spotted the oven cleaner on the floor, she realised he must have gotten hold of the bottle and ran his face under cold water.   “She called Peter’s sister, who lives up the road and they took Aaron to Glasgow Royal Infirmary , where Peter and I met them.   “During the car journey, Margaret noticed Aaron was grabbing his legs and when she tried to pull his trousers off to look further, they were stuck.   “She discovered the oven cleaner had soaked through to his legs.”        At hospital, doctors sprayed Aaron’s legs and face with water to remove the cleaner.   Later that day, he was transferred by ambulance to the Royal Hospital for Children to receive specialist care.    Paula said: “When I first saw Aaron’s face, I was shocked – it was so red.   “It looked like his face had melted.   “His eyes had swollen to the size of golf balls and he couldn’t open them.   “I immediately thought he’d be left blind but as soon as I walked towards his hospital bed, he shouted ‘Mummy’.   “It was such a relief that he could see.”    Surgeons took Aaron into theatre where he was given a general anaesthetic so they could remove the dead skin and bandage him up.   Doctors revealed he’d suffered a third-degree burn on his left leg which stretched from his ankle to his groin, and he needed skin grafts to repair the damage.   Thankfully Aaron’s face wasn’t burnt by the cleaner – instead, he’d suffered an allergic reaction which doctors prescribed antibiotics and eye drops for.   And three days after the accident, the little tot underwent two skin grafts in a two-hour operation on his legs.   Paula says: “It was awful, I felt constantly sick with worry and couldn’t stop crying.   “After his operation, Aaron was forced to wear a half cast on his leg so he couldn’t bend it and undo the skin graft.”      After a week in hospital, Aaron was discharged just two days before Christmas day.   Paula said: “He was forced to sit still instead of playing with his toys.”   Eight days later, Aaron’s cast was removed and doctors were pleased with his progress.   Paula says: “Doctors told me he would be left scarred and gave me gel to reduce the redness.   “I’m just thankful that they’re on his leg and are easily covered up.  He’ll need more skin grafts in the future as he grows but we’re taking it each day at a time.  Every day I replay receiving that phone call telling me Aaron had been hurt.

They want people with a terminal illness who have six months or less to live to be given the right to decide when they die. Assisted dying is illegal in the UK but every eight days a Briton travels to a suicide clinic in Switzerland, where it is permitted but costs an average of \u0026pound15,000 in expenses. The law change is being proposed by charity Dignity in Dying and backed by celebs including Patrick Stewart and Prue Leith. It follows the much-heralded model used in Oregon, US, in which the person must be of sound mind and able to administer the fatal concoction of drugs themselves.  Two independent doctors and a judge would assess requests – and the person could change their mind at any point. Our poll of 1,073 people found the age group most likely to support it are 55-64 year olds with four in five (81%) in favour. Nearly two in three people (63%) would even support giving people with incurable but non-terminal illnesses the right to die. Conservative voters are slightly more likely to oppose the change in law (15%) than Labour voters (11%). While 68% of 45-54 year olds would want a change in the law, 27% of people aged 65 and over would not.  More than a quarter (28%) have had someone close die whom they think would have considered an assisted death if legal. Our survey results come in the same week the Court of Appeal is due to rule on a legal challenge by terminal motor neurone disease sufferer Noel Conway, 68, who wants to die “on his own terms”. Mr Conway, a retired lecturer from Shropshire, is not expected to live longer than a year. He can only breathe with the help of a ventilator and wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe him a lethal drug dose. Assisting a suicide is also illegal in the UK and carries a maximum sentence of 14 years.

Forecasters predict the heatwave will continue to cook the country all week - with temperatures expected to soar well above today\u0027s 2018 record of 29C. As temperatures rose firefighters tackled a large moor fire on Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District where temperatures reached 25C earlier today.  The blaze began on the hills between Dove Stone Reservoir and Carrbrook in Tameside at 8.20pm last night and was quickly brought under control – but then started again this morning due to the heat and light winds, reports the MEN .   The rising temperatures have also sparked a warning from Public Health England over very high UV levels. Millions were snapped soaking up the sunshine after they flocked to beaches and parks following a weekend of wall-to-wall sunshine around the UK. People packed into Portobello Beach in Edinburgh, Scotland, where temperatures tipped 25C and Achnagart in Ross and Cromarty boasted a temperature of 27.5C while the heat hit 25.3C in Castlederg in Co Tyrone.  People sheltered from the sun beneath umbrellas in London\u0027s St James Park as the mercury peaked 29.4C today, in line with sunny holiday hot spots in southern Spain. The previous highest temperature recorded in the UK was 29.1 Celsius at St James Park, central London, on April 19. Higher temperatures are expected over the next days and the south west of England, the south and parts of Wales could enjoy 30C. Urging everyone to take precautions, Met Office forecaster Mark Foster: High pressure is going to dominate this week so we can expect very high levels of pollen and UV.  If you are in the sun you have a greater chance of getting burnt in the short term. Long days, very still conditions and clear skies help June temperatures to get very intense. The sun in June is relatively the highest it gets in the sky and heat can build up over successive days. The TUC has called on bosses to make sure staff working outdoors are protected from the sun and the heat. TUC general secretary Frances O\u0027Grady said: We all love to see the sunshine, but working outdoors in sweltering conditions can be unbearable and dangerous.

Back in October, when the burger was first released Jack Hinchliffe, director of KFC UK \u0026amp Ireland, said the burger has sold out in every country it has ever been released in.

Eleven other planes were then held up for two hours until the dog was finally caught by the police and a fire crew. The cheeky pooch has been taken to a dog rescue centre in Ibiza whilst an appeal is made to try and find its original owners.  But sadly it\u0027s not believed they are likely to come forward as it is believed the pitbull was deliberately abandoned so a new home will be sought for it.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement.

No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team bus, now every player will be together,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee kid henvey signs new dark blues deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee kid Matty Henvey has signed a new one-year contract.The 18-year-old striker broke into the first team near in late December and went on to make four appearances.He was side-lined by an injury suffered as he scored a dramatic late goal in the win at Hamilton Accies at the end of January and missed most of the rest of the season.Matty\u0026#8217s goals in the first part of the season were key to Dundee\u0026#8217s runners-up position in the development league.He joined the rest of the first team squad last week for pre-season training.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/B88-1971-08-00-Children-at-Broughty-Ferry-Beach-CDCT.jpg ","title":"dundee people from the 1920s to now hot summer days in the ferry","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFamilies enjoying a day out on the beach, kids having a splash about in the water, fishing off the harbour\u0026#8230 while somethings have undoubtedly changed over the years, it’s clear many things have remained exactly the same in Broughty Ferry.The suburb has long had a host of attractions and activities for residents and visitors alike.We dive into our archives once more to see what summer days were like in the Ferry.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2780eda4be9-180x180.jpg ","title":"dundee people karen helps to heal and comfort others","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“My job allows me to help heal and comfort others who are going through grief.”Karen Docherty, 42, has arguably one of the most unusual jobs that we have featured in this column. She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people pictures thousands gather at park for dundees race for life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of fundraisers turned up at Camperdown Country Park for a very worthy cause.Race for Life saw women and men of all ages, mostly decked out in pink, as they took part in a 10k run to raise cash for Cancer Research.Running, walking, jogging and even sprinting, more than 2,000 participants took part in the race around the city’s largest public park.There was also a 5k option, with some participants completing the event while twirling 4lb hula hoops – also known as powerhoops – round their waists."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people rubbish effort a good example","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils  Barnhill Primary School in Dundee have taken part in a litter pick.Fifteen youngsters took part and collected rubbish from their school grounds and the surrounding area.Councillor Craig Duncan, who also joined in, said the pupils were enthusiastic and that three bags of rubbish – including plastic bottles, crisp packets, sweet wrappers and broken plant pots – were collected.Mr Duncan said: “The kids were cheerful and are all up for doing another one.

This will be Neil’s second year in charge and just like everything else he has a specific style he wants to play.“I think we saw, I would say, more than glimpses of it last year.“It is a style of play I think is entertaining to watch.“We have a very good young base to build on and I think if we build on that base it will be very exciting next year.”The 2017/18 campaign ended with a degree of disappointment as the Dark Blues fell short of their target.A ninth-placed finish kept them in the division and, with a year’s experience as a manager under his belt, Nelms is backing Neil to succeed

to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking situation in Inverness \"a nightmare\" in last week\u0027 HN others have taken to social media to share their own frustrations.On Facebook Paul Tuthill said: \"As a powerchair user I find this frustrating. I think the general public lack awareness of the importance of these dropped kerbs.\"\u0026nbspAnd Hilton mother Sara Higgins says it is also an issue for parents.\"Parking on the pavements causes a lot of problems for a lot of people,\" she said.\"It\u0027 selfish and it\u0027 dangerous and it needs to stop.\"However a resident of Bruce Avenue in Dalneigh who did not want to be named also claimed that in some instances, drivers were forced to park on pavements by the lack of any alternative.He said that it is often impossible to find a space and blamed Highland Council for not providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side clear at all times.\"A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Regardless of whether parking provision is made for any property development this does not give motorists the right to park on pavements which, if causing an obstruction, is a reportable offence enforceable by Police Scotland.\"If waiting or loading restrictions are present these also cover the footpaths and are enforceable by the Highland Council Parking Team.\"Millburn ward councillor, Isabelle MacKenzie, said she has contacted Inverness city manager David Haas to try and organise a meeting\u0026nbsp with councillors to have the issue of pavement parking discussed as soon as possible.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 2:34

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing

a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings

by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

Jimmy Gray spoke out in support of Labour colleague and MSP David Stewart who is pressing for a new law compelling property owners to safely maintain their properties.Mr Stewart is contacting Highland Council chiefs to discuss his idea of regular surveys to gauge wear and tear, and to make owners carry out essential repairs.His proposal comes just a week after two people narrowly avoided being struck by falling debris in the city centre as Storm Hector hit.Earlier this year an apprentice stonemason also prevented another potential disaster when he spotted a masonry block hanging loose over Academy Street, apparently pulled loose by a banner attached to it.This week the Inverness Townscape Heritage project launched a new maintenance guide for owners of traditional properties, setting out key areas for them to consider, including the benefits of regular inspections.However Cllr Gray suggested a far tougher approach may be necessary.\"We cannot wait until there are serious injuries or deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years trying to persuade owners of buildings to act responsibly. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for

which led to the creation of AFC Community Trust.“Latterly he was a key member of the project team which successfully secured planning consent for the £50million community sports hub, training facility and new stadium.“George very much appreciates the scale of the task that lies ahead for the Club, not only in delivering the community and training facilities, as well as the new stadium, but also in substantially growing the Club so that it can retain its position at the top of Scottish Football and continue to make its mark in Europe.“I have enjoyed working with George during that time, and personally appreciate all that he has contributed to the Club’s progress over his time with us, we are indebted to him, and wish him all the best for the future.“He may be leaving his current role, but we are comforted in the knowledge that he will continue to play a role both as a fan and an ambassador of the Club.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinnes set to open up talks with skipper shinnie after his return","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes today confirmed he is ready to open up contract talks with skipper Graeme Shinnie.Negotiations on tying down Shinnie’s long-term future to the Reds could begin before the start of the season.Scotland cap Shinnie’s contract expires next summer and Championship side Bristol City have reportedly been tracking Shinnie.The 26-year-old will be free to talk to any interested clubs from January 1 when the winter transfer window opens.Ideally McInnes wants to secure the future of his skipper long before then.He said: “Getting Graeme Shinnie on a new contract is something we would all want.“Graeme had a lot to deal with over the summer as he was away with Scotland and got married.“I am sure we will pick up on that (contract talks) over the next few weeks.”Signed from Inverness Caley Thistle on a two-year deal in 2015, Shinnie penned a contract extension in January 2017 until summer 2019.The midfielder-defender travelled to South America with Scotland at the end of the Premiership campaign and earned a debut cap in the 2-0 friendly loss to Peru.He started the next game, a 1-0 loss to Mexico, when Dons team-mate Scott McKenna was skipper.McInnes said: “It was a huge relief for Graeme to get that first international cap.”Skipper Shinnie was today returning to Pittodrie for pre-season training having been given an extra few days break.Aberdeen returned from summer on Friday but players involved on international duty with Scotland over the summer were given a few extra days off.Centre-back McKenna and Scotland Under-21 winger Scott Wright also reported back for duty.The Dons were today set to jet out to the Republic of Ireland for a week-long training camp in Cork.They will face Cobh Ramblers in a friendly on Saturday.Aberdeen’s three summer signings are in contention to make their debut in that friendly – midfielders Chris Forrester, Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson.McInnes is happy to let SPFL arbitration sort out the training compensation for 18-year-old Ferguson which will now go to a tribunal.Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton have failed to agree a compensation deal for the teen.It is understood the Dons offered more than £100,000 for Ferguson with Accies’ valuation believed to be around £900,000 for the midfielder who made 14 first-team starts for Hamilton last season.McInnes said: “We’ll go to the tribunal but I’m confident and comfortable that we’ve done our due diligence and the tribunal outcome will reflect that.“Hamilton have got such a high regard for Lewis so I’m not surprised it’s going to a tribunal.“Hamilton have produced some good players. I hope that can continue to be the case and that Lewis can reach a good level. He has settled in well.“I’m pleased we have a young player like that as we cannot always sign ready-made players at Aberdeen.“McInnes aims to have secured more new signings before the Dons face Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round.Aberdeen host the English top flight Clarets in the first leg at Pittodrie on Thursday July 26 with the return a week later.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/Bypass-Junctions-926x564.jpg ","title":"7km section of aberdeen bypass to open on wednesday","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA four-mile stretch of the Aberdeen bypass is due to open this week.The road between the Parkhill and Blackdog junctions will welcome its first motorists on Wednesday.To coincide with the milestone new drone footage of the section has been released.The Blackdog junction opened to traffic last month to provide improved access to Potterton and Blackdog.On launching the road will have a speed limit of 70mph with a reduced limit on approach to the slip roads.It will provide improved links to Dyce, Bridge of Don and the realigned A947 Aberdeen to Banff road, as well as the B977 and B999.Cabinet Secretary for the economy, Keith Brown said: \u0026#8220I am pleased to confirm that a new seven kilometre section of the A90 between Parkhill and Blackdog will open this week.\u0026#8220I am sure this news will be appreciated by local communities, road users and businesses in the north east who continue to be extremely patient while these works are being undertaken.“The Parkhill to Blackdog section is the first section of the AWPR mainline trunk road to open and is the most substantial section of the project to open to date.\u0026#8220We said we would open new sections of road when possible, and we have stood by that commitment.“These new junctions and section of road will provide thousands of drivers every day with a range of benefits, including reduced journey times, improved journey time reliability, better local access and reduced congestion, while safety will also be enhanced.\u0026#8220Indeed, once the new road opens in its entirety, drivers will also have improved links to the north and south of Aberdeen, as well as to local areas.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"bus firm offers free travel to aberdeen veterans","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA bus firm is to offer free travel to veterans in Aberdeen.Stagecoach will be giving people carrying a military ID card or veteran’s badge free access as part of Armed Forces Day in Aberdeen on Saturday.The firm is encouraging those who are serving to take up the offer.Stagecoach North Scotland managing director David Liston said: “We are proud to once again be supporting the armed forces communities in north Scotland by providing free travel to military personnel.“By helping in this small way we hope to send a clear message that Stagecoach supports both personnel who are currently serving and veterans.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"family fun day date for the calendar to celebrate charitys 50th anniversary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen homelessness support charity will be marking its 50th anniversary this year with a family fun day.Aberdeen Cyrenians was originally formed as a soup kitchen run by students in Castlegate in 1968.It now works with people who are facing homelessness and hardship, as well as men and women experiencing domestic abuse.Fundraising manager Kate Loades said: “We’re really excited to be putting on this fun day in our 50th year, and have a day of family fun on offer.”The event will be held on Saturday at the Winter Gardens in Duthie Park between 11am and 3pm, and is part of year of activities planned by the charity to celebrate its anniversary.There will be a range of different activities for people to take part in, including beat the goalie and face painting.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sign language interpreter to be used for first time at scottish council meeting","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA sign language interpreter will be used for the first time at a Scottish council meeting tomorrow.The British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter will translate the debate of Moray councillors as they discuss the council’s new plan for users of BSL.In a first for any local authority in Scotland, the sign language translation will be captured on video using the council’s webcast system.Once approved, the plan will bring the council into compliance with the BSL (Scotland) Act 2015.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"NOSTALGIA  How horse power kept Innerleithen moving","story":"THIS week, Ross McGinn looks back at Innerleithen\u0026rsquos journey from horses to horse-power engines as a mode of transport...\nWhile much is currently talked about the transition to electric and driverless cars, here we look back to the last transition, in the early 1900s, with a move from horse to fuel-burning, engine-powered vehicles.\nThe High Street Smiddy (pictured below right), now the High Street Garage, was the very core of Innerleithen\u0026rsquos powerhouse.\nEach powerful animal had to be shod and fitted with appropriate pulling tackle.\nNot only was the horse used for its pulling power but many of the smaller breeds were used for leisure purposes.\nAs can be seen in the second photo (bottom right), a family group of riders prepare for a ride from outside Caerlee House in around 1910, no doubt off to explore the many trails by the river and on the hills around the town.\nFeaturing in the various processions of the day \u0026ndash pictured right at the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Games Week in Innerleithen and photographed by Thomas Colledge in 1907 \u0026ndash horse drawn carriages were the limousine of the day for local dignitaries such as the town Provost and Baillies.\nDaily coaches also ran to a time table from Innerleithen to St Mary\u0026rsquos Loch and Tibbieshiels and to the other Border towns of Peebles and Galashiels.\nThe change finally came in the early 1920s, as seen on the High Street in Innerleithen with a car outside the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Hotel (below).\nThereafter the horse and its power was gradually replace by horsepower provided by the internal combustion engine for transport, working the land and of course for leisure.\nIs the day approaching for the next transition?\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Line up unveiled for 16th Innerleithen music Festival","story":"NOW in its 16th year, Innerleithen Music Festival is gearing up for another feast of entertainment later this summer.\nAlways a hit with locals and visitors alike, this year promises to be another super showcase of, not only musical talent, but with other dance and drama events and for the first time ever \u0026ndash an art exhibition.\nFestival-goers can expect the usual great atmosphere and live music from local talent at the Live and Local event in the Vale Of Leithen Social Club throughout the weekend of August 17 to 19.\nHeadliners are soon to be announced, but firm favourites such as Unfinished Business, The IV Drips and Cameron Boak will all be there for your entertainment.\nThis event is Free all weekend and more details will be posted, including the full line up on the Live and Local facebook page.\nThe Friday evening kicks off with Act!

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"  39 We  39 re so proud of him  39   parents of Galashiels scout with ADHD hope to inspire others to join group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.

He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.

He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road. Mr Dickie said \u0026ldquoother retailers were interested in that site and they were looking to progress plans \u0026ldquorelatively quickly."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7919368.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Call for community to invest in Humbie wind farm","story":"              A COMMUNITY energy project is urging investors to back a project which will operate 12 wind turbines near Humbie and help tackle fuel poverty.  The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period.

The new Fibre Max 1 and Fibre Max 2 plans can achieve average download speeds of 145 Mbps and 300 Mbps respectively, the firm says.  In comparison, the most recent figures from regulator Ofcom clocked the current national average internet download speed at just over 46 Mbps.  The telecoms giant said that with the average UK home now containing 10 connected devices \u0026ndash a figure likely to continue rising \u0026ndash greater connectivity speeds are needed to handle increasing demand.  EE managing director of marketing Max Taylor said: \u0026ldquoOur new fibre broadband plans are designed to support the demands of customers with increasingly connected homes and families.  \u0026ldquoWith the growth of 4K TV, smart home technology becoming more popular than ever, and more members of the family using the latest smartphones and tablets, we\u0026rsquore giving our customers the widest range of converged mobile and home broadband products in the UK, along with the best customer service, so they can enjoy the fastest speeds both in and out of the home.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

No, not because it\u0026rsquos the time of year when thousands of children come knocking on your door, dressed as all kinds of demonic demons, demanding sugary snacks. This October is the deadline for all Scottish public bodies to achieve Cyber Essentials or Cyber Essentials Plus certification. The start of Scotland\u0026rsquos Cyber Resilience Strategy, one that ministers hope will be paralleled across the globe.    Deputy First Minister John Swinney\u0026rsquos vision is for Scotland to become a world leading nation in this field of expertise. If Scotland is to achieve this goal then its public sector must set a precedent for all others to follow. But with 60% of small businesses having been breached in the last year and with almost 40% of Scottish SMEs spending nothing on IT security* it seems that most of the public sector still need to act.  With the fears around cyber security more heightened than ever before, the Scottish Cyber Resilience scheme was developed in 2017 to lay the groundwork for minister\u0026rsquos long-term goal. The WannaCry ransomware attack of May 2017 accelerated the entire program after more than 300,000 computers were infected. Since then several requirements have been issued to those in the public sector regarding how government departments, local authorities and NHS boards can become more secure online.  While a large portion of Scottish public bodies already have cyber security measures in place, it\u0026rsquos the aim of Scottish ministers for the entire public sector to become exemplar in this field.  The following info gives an overview of cyber resilience and explains the steps the public sector should be taking:  What is Cyber Resilience?  Cyber Resilience means an all-encompassing approach that covers not only protective measures but also measures to respond and recover if you are attacked. Since cyber security is a risk management exercise, you should always be prepared for the worst to happen as there is always a margin of risk for things to creep through. That\u0026rsquos why, to cover all your bases, you need to be resilient and not just secure.  Products such as ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security best practice, and specifies the requirements for implementing an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS offers organisation-wide protection of all information in all its forms. By implementing an ISMS you would be in a position to identify risks and continue to protect against them.\u0026nbsp All leading cyber resilience programmes incorporate requirements that ISO 27001 lays out and eases the process of implementation.  How do I become compliant?  By taking the necessary steps, sooner rather than later.\u0026nbsp Steps such as confirming a Cyber Essentials pre-assessment has taken place, ensure staff have undertaken cyber resilience training, and have a cyber incident response plan, are just some of the initial actions the Scottish Government has proposed the public sector to take.  Alan Calder, the founder and executive chairman of IT Governance, one of the Scottish public sector\u0026rsquos preferred providers, says that it is critical that Scottish organisations start their compliance journey as soon as possible. \u0026nbsp  He said: \u0026ldquoCyber-crime is perhaps the single biggest threat to modern businesses and attacks are continually on the rise. The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos legislation is something that we as an industry welcome to encourage more organisations to effectively incorporate cyber resilience into their practices.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos fantastic to see is that the scheme incorporates the requirements of leading examples of cyber security such as the international information security standard ISO 27001 and the UK Cyber Essentials Scheme. That the Scottish Government has acknowledged that effective business continuity management makes up a crucial part of a comprehensive cyber resilience programme.    Where can I get support?  IT Governance has helped thousands of companies with their compliance journey\u0026rsquos including the University of Edinburgh and Glasgow city council.\u0026nbsp  The Scottish Government has listed a range of existing standards, guidelines and controls that can contribute to increased cyber resilience. IT Governance can help organisations meet compliance obligations through the implementation of an ISO 27001-compliant ISMS, business continuity management, incident response management and penetration testing.  IT Governance has recently opened a brand-new Edinburgh office to further support local organisations, and the Scottish public sector, to align their cyber resilience strategies with international best practice. The company is a specialist in ISO 27001 implementations, CREST-accredited Cyber Essentials certifications, penetration testing PCI DSS and the GDPR.

It comes after VTEC \u0026ndash a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin \u0026ndash was forced to axe its contract early after failing to meet cash targets.

LNER will operate until a public-private partnership takes responsibility for both trains and track operations in 2020.  UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted all railway lines \u0026ldquoshould be run in the interests of passengers and taxpayers, not private profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoPassengers, our economy and our environment need affordable fares and reliable services, which Tory policy is failing to deliver.  \u0026ldquoThe next Labour government will take our railways back into public ownership as franchises expire, using savings to cap fares, and would upgrade and expand the rail network.  Meanwhile, Manuel Cortes, general secretary of transport union TSSA, slammed UK ministers for failing to include Scottish representatives on the board of LNER, which serves stations including Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Inverness.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is typical of the pure anti-public sentiment held by privateer Tory Grayling that LNER will be running trains across Scotland without any Scottish representation on its board.

The ancient mythical story of Deirdrie and Naoise is also one of the first documenting the shared destiny of the people of Scotland and Ireland.  Now a romantic landmark has been unveiled on the west coast of Scotland in honour of the legend, close to a spot where the couple were said to have found some tranquillity together.  The \u0026ldquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise was officially unveiled at a ceremony on Saturday, attended by Michael Russell MSP and Mark Hanniffy, the Consul General of Ireland to Scotland, along with more than 100 guests and local dignitaries.  The sheiling itself \u0026ndash a Gaelic word for a hut, or collection of huts, once common in wild and lonely places in the hills and mountains \u0026ndash is on the slopes of Beinn Ghlas, near Taynuilt, overlooking Loch Etive, Argyll.  It marks a personal love story as well as it was commissioned by Sam Macdonald, whose wife, Evelyn Day, died of cancer last year, six weeks after being diagnosed. Mr MacDonald, 76, said that when his 83-year-old Irish wife of 50 years was told she did not have long to live, she asked him to build a memorial to mark her favourite story, so famed in Irish mythology.  Mr Macdonald said: \u0026ldquoWe decided on the garden when we knew that time was running out. We came out of the consultants, and after we gathered ourselves together, we started working on some lasting memory.  The tale itself, which links Ireland with Scotland, was first featured in the Glenmasan Manuscript, which is held in the National Library in Edinburgh and has just celebrated its 780th anniversary.  Known as \u0026ldquoDeirdre of the Sorrows, legend has it that before she was born, the most famous woman in Irish mythology was prophesied to become so beautiful, kings and lords would wage war over her. Urged to kill her at birth, King Conchobar of Ulster decided to put her into seclusion until she was old enough for him to take as a wife.  But fate intervened and Deirdre met Naoise, a handsome warrior in the King\u0026rsquos court and the pair fell instantly in love, fleeing to Scotland where they lived a happy life alongside his brothers for a number of years, until word reached them that the King would allow them to return to Ulster. However, upon so doing, Naoise was killed and the distraught Deirdre went on to take her own life.  The President of Ireland, Michael Higgins, was unable to attend the ceremony at the weekend, but sent a message of support, which read: \u0026ldquoThe tragic tale of the two doomed lovers is one of the great tales of an Ruraiocht, the Ulster Cycle, a mythic arc that is the shared inheritance of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland.  \u0026ldquoThere is perhaps no place on our islands more representative of that shared inheritance than Argyll, once the home of the ancient Gaelic Kingdom of Dal Riada. It was there that Cu Chulainn, the warrior-hero of the Ulaid, was said to have learned the arts of war, and it was there that Deirdrie sought sanctuary with Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle.  \u0026ldquoI am so pleased that a magnificent memorial will now rest forever on Beinn Ghlas, not far from Gleann \u0026Egraveite, the place Deirdre and Naoise were said to have found a moment of peace. May it stand as a monument, not only to the common past of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland, but to the shared destiny of our two ancient countries.  The sheiling is on land once owned by Mr Macdonald, now taken over by onshore wind generation firm Ventient Energy. It features within it the statue of Deirdre and Naoise that was originally created by Glasgow School of Art graduate, Fiona McLeod, for Scotland\u0026rsquos National Gardening Show, held in Strathclyde Park in 1997. The golden statue had been in Mr Macdonald\u0026rsquos garden since the show closed.  Visually, the sheiling, situated near one of the turbines on the Ventient Energy wind farm, looks like it has been on the site for 1,000 years due to its historic features, looking across the stunning Scottish landscape to where Deirdre and Naoise were said to live in the 7th Century AD.  Scott Mackenzie, CEO of Ventient Energy, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted to support Sam Macdonald in creating the stunning \u0026lsquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise\u0026rsquo. Its creation is being celebrated by the entire community and is something that can be visited and enjoyed by locals and visitors from further afield, including Ireland.  Mr Macdonald said the stories preserved largely through oral tradition are from a time when \u0026ldquoan aristocratic warrior class dominated, \u0026ldquo characterised by dramatic stories of fighting and adventure on the part of the chiefs.  He said Deirdre\u0026rsquos powerful tale, with its \u0026ldquoelements of lust, treachery and ultimate death, is vividly told and that while one may question whether the characters in the story ever existed, recent research into place names in the North Lorn area of Argyll suggests they may well have done. The findings raised the idea that perhaps Deirdre, Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle were real and did indeed reside in Glen Etive, given the number of place names that memorialise them in the landscape.  In raising the Sheiling for Deirdre and her lover, Mr Macdonald said he hopes to revitalise the ancient myths and reinforce the strong social and cultural ties that link the people of the west Highlands with their Irish neighbours across the water.  He is hopeful it will draw visitors from around the world as well.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos going to be a very romantic spot, he said. \u0026ldquoIt will be lovely if someone proposes there \u0026ndash and there\u0026rsquos the possibility of weddings, as outdoor weddings are very much in vogue now."},{"url":null,"title":"laird-questions-snp-government-tactics-during-ulva-buyout","story":"              The former owner of Ulva has claimed he was \u0026ldquokept in the dark and \u0026ldquostonewalled during the community buyout of the island.  Criticising both the buyers and the Scottish Government, Laird Jamie Howard questioned the tactics involved and accused the SNP of \u0026ldquoignoring its elected duty.  The community buyout of the island, located north-west of Mull, was finalised last week as the Howard family relinquished their private ownership of the site after 70 years.  It came after the government prohibited Mr Howard from selling on the open market as a community interest had been lodged by the North West Mull Community Company.  The Howards eventually sold to the community company in a deal worth \u0026pound4.650million.  However, the family have now released a statement taking sweeping blows at those who aided the publicly funded \u0026ldquotakeover of Ulva.  The statement claims: \u0026ldquoThe strong indication is that the driving impulse for this acquisition has been, and is, not so much for the welfare of Ulva and its resident community but more to satisfy the long held personal ambitions of a few relatively local individuals on the island of Mull to benefit SNP party politics and prejudices, and to feed media headlines.  \u0026ldquoOn multiple occasions, during the course of the acquisition procedure, the legislative guidelines (as published by this Scottish Government) were cast aside, with key, mandated deadlines mendaciously ignored by Ministers and Scottish civil servants in order to coincide with keynote party speeches by the First Minister and to facilitate the acquisition of Ulva, regardless of the merits or otherwise, or the fiscal viability of the community plans.  \u0026ldquoIt entirely ignored its elected duty to be even-handed to all Scottish constituents.  The community deal was backed by an unprecedented Scottish Land Fund award of \u0026pound4.415million.  The shortfall was made up by fundraising and a \u0026pound500,000 donation from Australian company, the MacQuarie Group, which takes its name from Lachlan MacQuarie - the Scottish soldier who became the country\u0026rsquos founding father.  Criticising the buyers, the statement adds: \u0026ldquoAt every stage of the proceedings Jamie Howard was kept in the dark and stonewalled with no access or recourse to official information or assistance.  \u0026ldquoTheir dissemination of false and misleading information through the general media has been astonishing and disappointing.  \u0026ldquoWe hope the SNP party activists concerned treat the long-standing Ulva residents with respect despite their track record thus far.  The Howards also took a swing at Argyll SNP MSP Mike Russell, accusing him of \u0026ldquoindulging in ubiquitous and tedious SNP partisan sound bitesinstead of communicating with his constituents.  The statement went on: \u0026ldquoTime will tell if Ulva continues to be the rural, natural beauty that it is today.  An SNP spokesman said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos land is a valuable asset which should benefit the many. The SNP is committed to empowering communities through land reform \u0026ndash enabling them to determine their own futures.  \u0026ldquoUlva was once home to over 800 people, and now has only a handful. This is a story which is, sadly, all too common to many of our islands.  \u0026ldquoWe wish the local community the very best as they seek to regenerate and repopulate the island of Ulva.  The North West Mull Community Company declined to comment.  Mike Russell said he received no contact from the family at any point to discuss their concerns, but would have been happy to meet with them."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-steps-up-debate-on-rewilding","story":"              They were once the great predators of Scotland - before their habitats were destroyed and they were hunted to extinction in the UK.  But now conservation groups are hoping to bring back the lynx and the wolf to Scotland as part of a controversial process known as rewilding.  Parts of the country have already experienced rewilding, with eagles, red squirrels and beavers already reintroduced, as well as trees and forests being protected and encouraged to grow.  However, calls are mounting to take things further and allow predators back on Scottish soil in a move conservationists claim will help to transform the country\u0026rsquos wildlife.  Steve Micklewright, chief executive of pro-rewilding charity Trees for Life, said: \u0026ldquoDespite its raw beauty, the Scottish landscape is today an ecological shadow of its former self.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot so long ago that vibrant, wild forest stretched across much of Scotland, with beavers and cranes at home in extensive wetlands and lynx and wild boar roaming in woodlands.  \u0026ldquoYet now our large carnivores are extinct, our woodlands reduced to small fragments, and a degraded landscape supporting little life stretches across millions of acres. But it doesn\u0026rsquot have to be this way.  The charity is about to publish a book which it hopes will spark debate about rewilding and offer a vision of how things could be for Scotland\u0026rsquos wildlife.  Scotland: A Rewilding Journey will look at the benefits and pitfalls of reintroducing predators - including addressing concerns over the potential threat to livestock.  Farmers have long opposed rewilding because of this issue, as well as concerns over replacing food production with wilderness.  However, Mr Micklewright believes farmers could look to other countries where wolves exist, such as Romania, for advice on how to protect livestock.  \u0026ldquoOur farmers are used to working in a landscape that doesn\u0026rsquot have these predators and so they don\u0026rsquot need to think about it, he said.  \u0026ldquoWolves were last seen in Scotland in the 1700s and lynx, in the late middle-ages, so they\u0026rsquove never had to deal with it.  \u0026ldquoBut in other countries, it means that farmers have to look after their animals differently. In Romania, for example, they use a big dog to scare the wolves off.  \u0026ldquoObviously farmers feel that they have the most to lose from rewilding, and no-one wants to risk anyone\u0026rsquos livelihood, so we need to look at how we address that and how we might compensate for that.  The charity boss claims that the book, which will be published in Autumn, is honest and addresses the potential pitfalls of rewilding, but also focuses on the opportunities for Scotland - particularly the tourism industry.  He said: \u0026ldquoPeople might think that rewilding means creating a wilderness where people don\u0026rsquot go, but that\u0026rsquos not the case.  \u0026ldquoWe believe we would have more people living in the Highlands if we did this, not less, and we\u0026rsquod have more jobs, not less, because people would want to see and experience it.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a big opportunity here for Scotland to become a world class environment that people want to come and visit.  Mr Micklewright believes the Highlands could become the Scottish equivalent of Yellowstone National Park in the US - where rewilding, despite some difficulties, has proven to be a success and regularly draws millions of visitors to the site each year.  Wolves were reintroduced to the park in 1995 and have been credited with increasing beaver populations and bringing back aspen trees and vegetation.  Trees for Life is already being recognised for the work it has done on Dundreggan estate in the Highlands, which was being overgrazed by deer and sheep.  The charity is reforesting the area and by 2058, expects to see red squirrels, beavers and wild boars return to the area.  However, Mr Micklewright claims reintroducing wolves in the Highlands is still a long way off.  \u0026ldquoWolves and lynx are already making a comeback in other parts of Europe, but - obviously - they can\u0026rsquot get to Scotland unless we decide to bring these animals back.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore a bit scared of that idea. When it comes to the bigger predators, that\u0026rsquos still a big, scary thing for a lot of people.  \u0026ldquoI doubt that wolves will be reintroduced in my lifetime, but I\u0026rsquom hopeful that the lynx is more of a possibility.  \u0026ldquoThe actual practicalities of reintroducing the animals is not the difficult part in all of this - it\u0026rsquos the social stuff, the conversations that need to be had, that\u0026rsquos the hard part.  \u0026ldquoWe need to start conversations with politicians, with farmers and landowners - we need to have a national debate about rewilding.  \u0026ldquoAnd hopefully the book will help to start that process.  Trees for Life has launched a crowdfunding appeal to help fund the publication of Scotland: A Rewilding Journey.

Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, insisted its priority was making sure Scotland could stay in the single market and customs union, but added it was \"watching developments\" over the prospect of another EU vote.  He said a hard Brexit would signal a \"clear road map towards a second independence referendum that for me would be the priority\".  It comes as SNP Brexit minister Michael Russell said he was \u0026ldquoabsolutely not hostile to a second vote on any future deal, but suggested the result in Scotland would need to be respected.  He told the BBC: \u0026ldquoThere will have to be a vote at some stage. The question is what vote and when, and how it\u0026rsquos going to be achieved, and presently we don\u0026rsquot have answers to that.  Mr Blackford said the SNP was not \u0026ldquoin all circumstances diametrically opposed to a further referendum, adding: \u0026ldquoWe have an open ear to developments on that front, but for us it\u0027s the priority of staying in the single market and the customs union that\u0027s most important.\"  He argued that if the UK Government did not listen to the SNP\u0027s \"power grab\" concerns over its Brexit legislation, then an independence vote could follow and the Scottish Government had a mandate.  He said: \"What I\u0027m seeking to do is to defend the rights of the Scottish people and the powers that they have in their parliament, that is the immediate priority for us.  \"Of course I would make the point that if we cannot get the UK Government to listen on this then ultimately we will be having a discussion with the people of Scotland as to how we best protect our parliament, I would argue that independence is the best way of doing that.\"  He added: \"We\u0027re not at the moment talking about a timing of an independence referendum, what we have said is that we\u0027ll make a judgment on that once we\u0027ve got to the end of the Brexit process, so we\u0027ll concentrate on making sure we\u0027re standing up for our rights through the Brexit process.  \"We will have that debate with the people of Scotland and the economic future of Scotland, but we will only come back to a discussion on the timing of a referendum once we\u0027ve got through the Brexit process.\"  As Theresa May narrowly won another crunch vote on the Government\u0027s European Union (Withdrawal) Bill last week, Mr Blackford branded the Prime Minister \"very weak\", adding \"at some point that luck will run out\"."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-brussels-has-accepted-brexit-but-it-remains-to-be-seen-if-britons-are-ready-to-accept-the-terms-of-departure","story":"              THIS Thursday in Brussels, all eyes will be on Belgium as they attempt to inflict defeat on a country which knows all too well about trudging away from the international stage.  But while fans gather in Place du Luxembourg to cheer on Les Diables Rouges against England, 27 European leaders will meet in a nearby building to ask why the UK can\u0026rsquot decide how to walk away from the EU.  Two years on from the Leave vote, they will gravely agree there has been a lack of progress. Then they will move on.  For while the Brexit soap opera continues to play out here in the UK, the attitude in Brussels is a collective shrug of the shoulders. Or \u0026lsquobof\u0026rsquo, en fran\u0026ccedilais.  Brexit is not even on the agenda for the main business being discussed at this week\u0026rsquos European Council meeting in the Belgian capital.  At the top of the to-do list is migration, and control of the EU\u0026rsquos external borders. Security and defence, tax evasion and avoidance, and how to regulate data across the continent will also come up - critical national issues only resolved with close international working relationships between neighbours.  Last week, I was in Brussels to witness what our European allies think about Brexit, two years since the vote.  In one sentence, it\u0026rsquos this: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore sorry you\u0026rsquore leaving, but get on with it.  The EU and its institutions have moved on, accepting the UK is on the way out and getting on with their work which affects citizens in 27 other countries.  In the European Parliament last week there was a hotly-contested internal debate about fertiliser \u0026ndash no doubt a headline writer\u0026rsquos dream for Britain\u0026rsquos Eurosceptic tabloids if they still employed Brussels-based journalists.  The debate centres on how much cadmium \u0026ndash a toxic-heavy metal \u0026ndash should be used in fertiliser, and the outcome will eventually affect every farm in the EU. It will also affect anyone wanting to import fertiliser from the EU after Brexit, but by then we\u0026rsquoll have no say over it.  There was a vote on copyright reform, which is designed to give publishers more control over how their content is used digitally. It\u0026rsquos gone too far and could remove links to the quality Press on social media sites, allowing \"fake news\" and the conspiracy theorist blogs that appeared during the indyref and EUref to prosper.  Tory, Labour and SNP MEPs from the UK are fighting it \u0026ndash but they lose their seat at the negotiating table next March.  For the people who work in Brussels and shape policy across Europe, Brexit is a decision made in the past while they look to the future.  One seasoned observer said the EU member states have never been more united on this \u0026ndash they are sticking together.  And they are sticking together because of the impact on Ireland. The warnings of a negative impact on the UK economy were made clear during the EUref, and ignored by voters, but the people of Ireland should not have to suffer as a result.  If Brussels is shrugging its shoulders when it comes to the UK, it is putting its arms around the shoulders of Ireland.  \u0026ldquoWe want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone,\" Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in Dublin last week.  It\u0026rsquos not what Theresa May, David Davis or Liam Fox says that interests Europe, it\u0026rsquos what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says. If he isn\u0026rsquot happy, the EU isn\u0026rsquot happy.  The UK Government can come up with as many inventive solutions to the border problem as it wants it will only happen if the Irish agree.  The \u0026lsquoBaileys test\u0026rsquo must be met: millions of gallons of milk travel unhindered across the border during the production of Irish cream liquor, and that must continue to be the case.  The solution, to everyone in Brussels at least, is obvious: the UK can remain in both the single market and a customs union. That\u0026rsquos achieved by being in the European Economic Area.  Earlier this month, Brussels\u0026rsquo chief negotiator Michel Barnier confirmed this model is possible to a Green MEP.  It would require some sort of renegotiation \u0026ndash the EEA agreement does not cover agriculture, which is vital to preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland.  But while tailoring for off-the-shelf options is possible new bespoke deals are not.  Labour\u0026rsquos suggestion that Britain can somehow negotiate single market access while also securing changes to the principle of freedom of movement is simply dismissed.  The Norway-style option of EEA membership is opposed by Jeremy Corbyn because it would make the UK a \"rule-taker\" not a rule-maker. The Eurocrats agree that UK influence would reduce in this scenario, but that\u0026rsquos not their problem.  The UK would become a \"lobbying nation\", holding joint parliamentary summits like Norway does in a desperate attempt to influence decisions.  But, despite that, most in Brussels still can\u0026rsquot understand why the UK would consider shunning this option when the only alternative \u0026ndash apart from reversing Brexit \u0026ndash is a \"no-deal\" scenario.  Airbus last week explained in stark terms what that means: one of the country\u0026rsquos largest companies which employs 14,000 people leaving the UK. If that threat to jobs isn\u0026rsquot enough to spur Labour into action, it\u0026rsquos hard to understand what will.  So it looks more and more likely that we are heading for a \"no-deal\" option.  Liam Fox has insisted that Theresa May is not bluffing when she threatens to walk way without a deal.  Nobody in Brussels thinks she\u0026rsquos bluffing anyway. They have laid out the options and have moved on while they wait for her to decide.  If this is what the Prime Minister presents to MPs this autumn, what happens next is a huge unknown.  Will Labour and Tory rebels join forces to defeat the government? Will Theresa May be forced to resign? Could a two-thirds parliamentary majority be assembled to trigger a General Election?  Or will, as the tens of thousands who marched in London on Saturday demanded, there be a \"people\u0026rsquos vote\" on whether to proceed with Brexit? One poll at the weekend suggested there is now a narrow majority for Remain.  Brussels may have accepted that Britain is leaving, but it remains to be seen if the people of Britain are ready to accept the terms of that departure."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-calls-for-rail-public-ownership-as-quickly-as-possible","story":"              Jeremy Corbyn has insisted train companies need to be put under public ownership as soon as possible as Labour launched a Rail Mayhem campaign day.

The Speaker of the House of Commons was elected in June 2009 and promised to serve for nine years, a commitment he has since reneged on.  As the ninth anniversary of his election passed, Mr Bercow told a reception in Speaker\u0027s House at the Palace of Westminster: \"Notwithstanding occasional rumours to the contrary, I have got absolutely no intention of going anywhere.\"  He first took the Speaker\u0027s chair on June 22 2009, promising to serve \"no more than nine years in total\".

Audrey Glover, who headed an Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) delegation said unbalanced media coverage in favour of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling party resulted in voters not being able to make an informed choice.  She said Turkey had \"work\" to do to ensure that future elections meet democratic standards.  Ignacio Sanchez Amor, the mission\u0027s special coordinator, said the observers \"profoundly regret\" that two observers were denied entry into Turkey over alleged bias against the country.  He called the move an \"utterly unacceptable attempt to influence\" the process.  Monitors, however, praised the high turnout in the Turkish vote, which was reported to be more than 87% by the state-run Anadolu Agency.  Mr Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for the past 15 years, is set to extend his rule and take on sweeping new powers after winning landmark presidential and parliamentary elections.  Turkey\u0027s High Electoral Board declared Mr Erdogan, 64, the winner of Sunday\u0027s polls, which usher in a new executive presidential system which was approved in a referendum last year.  Under the system, the office of the prime minister is eliminated and executive powers are transferred to the president, who can rule with only limited checks and balances.  The Turkish leader, who is accused by critics of adopting increasingly authoritarian tactics but is loved by supporters for bringing prosperity and stability, may be facing rough times ahead, however. Analysts are predicting an economic downturn amid rising inflation and a struggling currency.  His win could deepen Turkey\u0027s rift with Western allies, who are already concerned by setbacks in democracy and human rights as well as Turkey\u0027s closer ties with Russia.  However, Turkey\u0027s currency, the lira, rallied on Monday over Mr Erdogan\u0027s victory, which allows the country to avoid instability in the short-term.  In his victory speech, Mr Erdogan said he would work towards achieving his goal of making Turkey one of the world\u0027s top 10 economies by 2023, when the Turkish Republic marks its centenary.  He also pledged a more \"determined\" fight against outlawed Kurdish rebels and alleged members of a movement led by US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he accuses of orchestrating a 2016 failed coup against his government. Mr Gulen denies any involvement.  \"Turkey made its choice in favour of a more determined fight against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) and (Gulenists),\" Mr Erdogan said.  \"We will go after terror organisations with stronger determination.\"  Under the new system, Mr Erdogan will appoint ministers, vice presidents and high-level bureaucrats, issue decrees, prepare the budget and decide on security policies.  According to unofficial results that have yet to be confirmed by the electoral board, Mr Erdogan garnered 52.5% of the votes, while his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, won 42.5% in the parliamentary vote. Mr Erdogan\u0027s closest contender, Muharrem Ince of the main opposition Republican People\u0027s Party, won 30.7%.  Mr Erdogan\u0027s AKP fell short of a parliamentary majority but a better-than-expected performance by its nationalist ally should allow the party to control the 600-seat legislature.  Mr Ince, who complained of unfair elections, accepted Mr Erdogan\u0027s victory during a news conference on Monday.  He told reporters: \"There are no significant differences between our records and the Supreme Election Council\u0027s records. I accept the results of the elections.\"  The politician, who led a robust campaign against Mr Erdogan, called on him to end his divisive policies.  \"Be the president of 81 million (Turks), embrace everyone,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what I would have done if I had won.\"  The 54-year-old politician criticised Turkey\u0027s new system, saying: \"Turkey has cut off its ties with democratic values... (Turkey) has transitioned to a one-man regime in the fullest sense.\"  The pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party, whose presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas was forced to campaign from inside prison, received the more than the 10% of votes required to win seats in parliament, spilling thousands of its supporters into the streets in celebration."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-uncertainty-could-lead-to-north-sea-missed-opportunity","story":"              UNCERTAINTY surrounding Brexit could result in a \"missed opportunity\" for the North Sea oil and gas industry, MPs have been told.

She said: \"The biggest challenge for the industry over the next year and certainly one we\u0027re experiencing now is the uncertainty.  \"The industry is a global market, they will make whatever market they are in work or they will withdraw, but uncertainty creates that missed opportunity, whether it\u0027s a missed opportunity in investment right now in the North Sea, whether it\u0027s growth in their current business, whether it\u0027s the ability to secure a contract in another country because of that uncertainty of what the terms may ultimately be in another year.  \"That is the part that is impacting us and that is the part that needs to be sorted out as quickly as possible.\"  Professor Paul de Leeuw, director of the Oil and Gas Institute at Robert Gordon University, added: \"Where we see particularly the biggest issue on Brexit from an oil and gas perspective, and I do not make a political point here, is round the potential impact between what is currently in place and going to WTO (World Trade Organisation) tariff arrangements.  \"We see that as having quite an impact on the supply chain in terms of additional cost.  \"The other one... is access to high quality resources and particularly people, either EU citizens or non EU citizens.\"  Highlighting that about 10% of people working in the industry fell into those categories, he added: \"They are in high value jobs and this industry is relying on access to equipment, is relying on import of goods and services, relying on exporting goods and services and on people so the main thing the industry needs in my view is absolutely frictionless access to it and continuous arrangements in place.  \"Our Vision 2035 relies to a very large extent on exports and actually doing more activities overseas.  \"We need investment particularly in the next few years in the North Sea before the North Sea potentially declines in production post-2020 and actually having investment coming in here, less uncertainties and people not saying \u0027I\u0027m going to wait to see what plays out\u0027 is going to be critical for this industry.\""},{"url":null,"title":"norwegian-air-squares-up-to-ba-with-launch-of-florida-flight","story":"              Low-cost airline Norwegian has intensified its battle with British Airways in the long-haul market.

The teenager was just 13 when he carried out the knife attack at a West Lothian secondary school on 15 September 2017, a court heard.  The incident allegedly happened just before 9am in the restaurant area, which had around 200 people in it at the time.  The subject of the attack was cut with what is understood to have been a kitchen knife, leaving him permanently disfigured.  The injured teenager was rushed by ambulance to St John\u0027s Hospital in Livingston for treatment to the gaping wound.  The court was told that the victim, who was aged 14 at the time, would be scarred for life as a result of the assault.  The accused, who gave a new address in Aberdeenshire, travelled to Livingston Sheriff Court in West Lothian with his mum for the brief hearing on Monday.  Wearing smart black school trousers and a white shirt with an embroidered tie, he spoke only to confirm his identity.  The youth admitted assaulting the other pupil by punching him on the head and \"struggling with him whereby he was struck on the head with a knife\".  He was originally charged with striking the boy with the blade, but the Crown agreed to amend the wording of the indictment.  He also pled guilty to assaulting another 14-year-old pupil by repeatedly punching him on the head and body during the same incident.  The youth further admitted having a knife on school premises without reasonable excuse or lawful authority.  However, the Crown accepted his not guilty plea to sending threatening messages the previous day to the boy he punched and a 15-year-old boy.  A charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by hiding the knife he used in the assault in order to conceal or dispose of evidence implicating him in the commission of the crime was also dropped.  Despite the seriousness of the crimes, neither the accused, his victims, nor the school they then attended can be named because the law bars identification of all juveniles under the age of 18.  Jim Robertson, prosecuting, moved for sentence and said there was no record of previous offending to put before the court.  Andy Aitken, defending, suggested that the Children\u0027s Reporter should be asked for advice on sentencing options, given his client\u0027s young age at the time of the offence.  He added: \"He\u0027s on bail and his current address is in Aberdeenshire. He\u0027s travelled to court today with his mother.\"  He asked the court to continue the accused\u0027s bail while background reports were prepared, and Sheriff Martin Edington agreed to do so.  Adjourning the case until 19 July, Sheriff Edington told the youth: \"In terms of what Mr Aitken has had to say to me today, I\u0027m going to to ask advice from the Children\u0027s Panel with regards to this matter.  \"At the same time I\u0027m also going to defer sentence on you so the social work department can prepare a report for the court in relation to matters such as whether you might require supervision or be able to carry out any form of court-imposed sentence.  \"Your bail will be continued on exactly the same basis as it is now.\""},{"url":null,"title":"orwell-would-have-loved-this-book-loki-wins-prestigious-literary-prize","story":"              IT has been described as a \"savage, wise and witty tour-de-force\" by JK Rowling, and has been one of the most talked-about books published in Scotland in recent times.  Now Poverty Safari, the debut by the writer and rapper Darren McGarvey, also known as Loki, has won one of the UK\u0027s most prestigious literary awards, The Orwell Prize.  The chair of the award\u0027s judges said that \"George Orwell would have loved this book\" and compared it to Orwell\u0027s classic books on poverty.  The \"unflinching account of the realities of systematic poverty\" won McGarvey the \u0026pound3,000 cheque for his first book, which is published by Luath Press, of Edinburgh.  The writer was presented with the prize by Richard Blair, the son of George Orwell.

The win is also a coup for Luath, a small press based in the Scottish capital.  Andrew Adonis, the chair of the judges, said: \"George Orwell would have loved this book.  \"It echoes Down and Out in Paris and London and The Road to Wigan Pier.  \"It is heart-rending in its life story and its account of family breakdown and poverty.  \"But by the end there is not a scintilla of self-pity and a huge amount of optimism.

He was part of the Poverty Truth Commission that was hosted in Glasgow in 2009 and has presented eight programmes for BBC Scotland exploring the root causes of anti-social behaviour and social deprivation.

Excavations at the Udal on the Outer Hebridean island have uncovered some of the hardships islanders faced during Neolithic and early Bronze Age Scotland.  Analysis of two skeletons discovered at the site indicates they suffered a lack of food as children, including periods of starvation.

The research, published in a new book, reveals that islanders were then hit by further storms, with one bringing a flood so severe that it destroyed their new fields and spread a thick stone and shingle beach across them.  The devastating weather damaged crops and killed animals, impacting on the health of residents, as shown in the two skeletons which were discovered in a burial cairn.  Ms Ballin Smith added: \u0026ldquoOur Neolithic and Bronze Age ancestors lived through climate change events such as dramatic sea-level rise and increased storminess, and trauma such as loss of fields, crops and animals.  \u0026ldquoThey had to relocate their settlement and houses to safer areas.

Keryn Laver, of Oakley, near Dunfermline, needed urgent help to deliver the baby after her waters broke while her husband Jules was rushing her to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.  Now she has been reunited with the Scottish Ambulance Service paramedics who helped bring little Keldan into the world and said: It was a very, very memorable birth and I am absolutely pleased it turned out the way it did. We are lucky it was very straight forward.  The day of Keldan\u0026rsquos birth had an extra special significance for Keryn it was the day her brother, Cedric, passed away in 2009 after a sailing accident.  While the birth of her first child Torin three years ago took\u0026nbsp27 hours, baby number two due on March 11 was a very different story.    At around 8pm, four days before the baby was due, the 39-year-old phoned Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy to say that contractions had started and were happening around every two minutes.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe hospital told me to get in fast. The contractions got closer together and I phoned a babysitter.  \u0026ldquoI told them \u0026lsquoyou will have to come here very quickly \u0026ndash the baby is coming. I was sitting on the couch at home, and my husband Jules was with me.  \u0026ldquoThe babysitter took about 20 minutes to arrive \u0026ndash the contractions were coming so fast and then my water broke as I was getting into the car. We were in the car and I was screaming. My husband started driving me to hospital.  \u0026ldquoAround 0.8 miles down the road, there was a little layby near the Carnock Inn. It was a little layby, but it still big enough to get two cars in.  \u0026ldquoJules called 999 at around 8.45pm \u0026ndash they could hear me in the background. I was in the front seat and I still had my jeans on. The call taker asked Jules if he could see anything, whether I was dilated or if he could see the baby\u0026rsquos head.  \u0026ldquoThey said they would send an ambulance as quickly as they could. The ambulance came around the corner and must have heard me from the car.  As she was put on to the stretcher by paramedics Andrew Paterson and Richard Garside, based at Dunfermline, the baby\u0026rsquos head was out.  But the paramedic crew, on their first job for the night, helped deliver the baby at 9.03pm, perfectly healthy, at 8lb 6oz.    Mrs Laver added: \u0026ldquoHolding this little baby, I was full of joy. I think for my husband it was a huge relief that he did not have to deliver it. He had to drive himself to the hospital, but he saw the baby being born.  \u0026ldquoJules took some time to compose himself, he was keeping it together, but it was so close to him having to deliver the baby in the car. He had to keep calm, but once the crew arrived, he could enjoy the birth and then all the emotions hit.  Keryn said it was a \u0026ldquototally different experience to the birth of her first child.  She explained: \u0026ldquoWith my first baby, I didn\u0026rsquot know what to expect, and it was a really long labour. I prefer a quick birth.  After her second birth, she said she could have been home that night but she was kept in Victoria overnight, arriving home the next morning.  Keryn continued: \u0026ldquoThe crew was really surprised, and they were very good with both of us they were joking with me, and supportive of Jules. They gave me whatever I needed.  Mr Paterson also gave Keldan a knitted beanie, made by the paramedic\u0026rsquos grandmother, and kept in the back of the ambulance for such occasions.  Now, the Oakley mum said March 7 has a different meaning these days, adding: \u0026ldquoIt changes a bitter day and turns it into a happy day.  \u0026ldquoEvery time his birthday comes around, we will tell the story \u0026ndash it will be told at his 21st birthday.  \u0026ldquoTorin was quite pleased to meet his baby brother. It took a while to realise it happened so quickly.  In memory of her brother, Keryn named her second child Keldan Cedric Laver.  She said her friends, once hearing of the birth, were shocked and couldn\u0026rsquot believe the location of the birth.  As a thank you, the mum sent the crew a card to thank them and let them know Keldan was healthy.  Mrs Laver said after meeting the paradmedics: \u0026ldquoIt was great to see Richard and Andy again. In the card I sent, I thanked them for helping our baby boy into the world.\"    Keldan\u0026rsquos birth certificate lists the location as Carnock Road.  Mr Garside, who has since been seconded to Helimed 76 as an air ambulance paramedic, said: \u0026ldquoIt was our first job of the night.  \u0026ldquoAs the patient was in a car, in a layby, in labour we knew the birth was imminent so we got there quickly.  \u0026ldquoWe were just in time to be able to get mum into the ambulance where the baby was born. A couple of minutes slower and the baby would have been born in the car footwell.

The report recommends that workers and communities must take the lead in making decisions for moving away from Trident \"but a broad partnership involving all stakeholders is necessary for success\".    Funding must be available not just for putting a plan into action but for organising, analysis of the situation, planning and then implementation, the charity said.  Peter Burt, Nuclear Education Trust Board trustee said: \u0026ldquoOur independent analysis of international experience of defence diversification tells us that a government needs to be proactive in getting the conditions right for a successful transition from skilled defence jobs to those in the equally skilled, civil sector. Those conditions include complete stakeholder participation including workers and communities, and national, regional and local political support. Proactive planning and comprehensive funding, with continued learning for effective implementation are essential for success.  \"Many defence industry jobs are at risk from automation, global supply chains, changes in strategic thinking as well as the sheer cost of the work in today\u0027s austere financial climate. The Nuclear Education Trust calls on the current and future governments to make use of the findings of this research and integrate them into an effective defence diversification policy, part of a comprehensive industrial strategy.\"  Fabian Hamilton, MP, shadow minister for peace and disarmament said: \"While it is not yet Labour Party policy to scrap Trident, I am committed, not only to transitioning away from nuclear weapons, but to protecting jobs at the same time.  \"High-skilled jobs are good for our economy and, if we decide to transition away from Trident, defence diversification is the only way to ensure that the vital skills used in the development of Britain\u0027s nuclear weapons are not lost.

When decisions are made, it\u0027s important to protect and prioritise good quality UK jobs and the communities linked to the defence industry.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

You might even be able to buy your own one!The pupils had been working on the concept of improving cycling safety since January and came up with the idea of covering a bike in Led lights.The bike was coded using a BBC micro:bit and buttons were wired up to have functions such as working indicators, brake lights \u0026ndash which turn the whole bike red \u0026ndash and a speedometer, as well as customisable colours.Pupils taking part in Apps for Good explore all aspects of product development, from the initial idea and programming to product design and marketing.Mr Aitken says he hopes to build on the success of the Light Bike by setting up an Inventors\u0026rsquo Club in Wick High and possibly a CoderDojo \u0026ndash part of a network of computer programming clubs \u0026ndash for primary children.This week\u0026rsquos category win was the latest in a series of Apps for Good achievements by teams from Wick High.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been incredibly lucky to have seen success now at the Apps for Good Awards for six years running \u0026ndash an unbeaten record, Mr Aitken said.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen our ideas evolve from the creation of wireframe prototypes to full-blown apps and we\u0026rsquore now pushing the boundaries further with the introduction of Internet of Things, physical computing, and very soon we\u0026rsquoll be starting machine learning / artificial intelligence with our pupils.\u0026ldquoAs always, I\u0026rsquom excited for what the future may bring for Wick High School pupils.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 25, 2018 at 5:29 pmSurface dressing work will continue tomorrow, Tuesday June 26 on the main road in Evie (the A966 from the 30mph sign at the cemetery to the Old Evie School) and the road will be closed in both directions.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I came here in 2016 and part of what drew me was the juxtaposition of a cultural and natural heritage site.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\". Entries are now open in a variety of classes. He can be contacted at emailing mackenzie@iambik.orgMeanwhile Inverewe is anticipating the bursting into colour of a Puya alpestris, which resembles a giant asparagus, for the first time in seven years.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The project also details Avoch\u0026rsquos fishing heritage, and more information on this can be found on panels at the harbour and among the \"streeties\" \u0026ndash the rows of old fishermen\u0026rsquos cottages.Funding for the new project was provided by Avoch Heritage Association in recognition of the work AKCC is doing to promote the village and its historical significance.The community council\u0026rsquos chairwoman Sarah Dunton said: \"Volunteers from AKCC carried out the restoration work on the wooden frame and also created the updated information panel.\u0026nbsp\"It is a testament to the great team spirit existing within AKCC.\u0026nbsp\"We are very grateful to Avoch Heritage Association for generously funding this project.\u0026nbsp\"It will encourage not just residents of Avoch and Killen but also visitors to the Black Isle to enjoy the beautiful scenery and wildlife surrounding us.\"Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.
