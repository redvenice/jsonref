Sixteen officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police (boat pictured left) also boarded the tanker. Spain said the raid was carried out after a request by the US         Gibraltar\u0027s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said the tanker was carrying oil to a refinery in Syria. Shipping data reveals the cargo likely originated in Iran         A dinghy belonging to the Royal Marines and a larger vessel of the Royal Gibraltar Police sit alongside the Grace 1 supertaker on ThursdayThe stoppage comes at a politically sensitive time - as Europe launches a financial trading instrument designed to circumvent US sanctions on Iran in an attempt to save the nuclear deal.European Union sanctions against the government of Syria took effect in May 2011, shortly after the start of President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators that mushroomed into a protracted civil war.Iran, a close ally of Assad, is also under a U.S. sanctions regime meant to bar all international sales of Iranian oil, imposed after President Donald Trump withdrew Washington last year from world powers\u0027 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.In a statement, the Gibraltar government said it had reasonable grounds to believe that the Grace 1 was carrying its shipment of crude oil to the Banyas refinery in Syria.\u0027That refinery is the property of an entity that is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria,\u0027 Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said. \u0027With my consent, our port and law enforcement agencies sought the assistance of the Royal Marines in carrying out this operation.\u0027 Government-controlled areas of Syria suffered acute fuel shortages earlier this year resulting from what Assad described as an economic siege. In May, Syria received its first foreign oil supplies for six months with the arrival of two shipments including one from Iran, a source familiar with the shipment said.The Gibraltar government published regulations on Wednesday to enforce the sanctions against the tanker and its cargo.A British Foreign Office spokesman said: \u0027We welcome this firm action by the Gibraltarian authorities, acting to enforce the EU Syria Sanctions regime.\u0027Earlier this year, Reuters revealed how the Grace 1 was one of four tankers involved in shipping Iranian fuel oil to Singapore and China, in violation of U.S. sanctions.         British forces believe the Grace 1 was being used to transport crude oil to a refinery in Syria in breach of EU sanctions (pictured, a Royal Navy support vessel off Gibraltar)Shipping data indicates the ship is a 300,000-tonne, Panamanian-flagged tanker managed by Singapore-based IShips Management Pte Ltd.Iran has accused the Trump administration of waging \u0027economic war\u0027 against it with a campaign to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero, following the U.S. pullout from a global nuclear deal that Trump said was dangerously flawed in Tehran\u0027s favour.Iranian crude exports were around 300,000 barrels per day or less in late June, industry sources said, a fraction of the more than 2.5 million barrels per day that Iran shipped in April 2018, the month before Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal.Iran has vowed to breach the accord\u0027s curbs on its uranium enrichment capacity one by one until it is able to sell that amount of oil again. Tehran says this is the least it should be able to expect from a deal that offered economic gains in exchange for nuclear limits.Fears of war have risen as the U.S.-Iranian stand-off have led to attacks on several oil tankers in the Gulf, Iran\u0027s shooting downing of a U.S. military surveillance drone, and planned U.S. air strikes on Iran called off by Trump at the last minute. Iran has refused to be pushed into negotiations on stricter limits to its nuclear activity and regional behaviour."},{"url":null,"title":"Cheeky feline caught camera opening drawer knows treats stored","story":"British mother who went on the run for three years with...

In a section entitled My Body Is a Weapon, the veteran Czech photographer Libuše Jarcovjáková enthralls with her edgy diaristic approach, laying bare a life lived recklessly amid a period of political repression in the 1970s and 80s. In shadowy monochrome, the young, self-taught Jarcovjáková relentlessly photographed her own wild, doggedly self-destructive life in images that pay little attention to formal concerns, but nevertheless capture a time and milieu in an uncompromising way.There is not trace of romanticism here, rather a portrayal of a hedonistic time when sex and alcohol were constants and excess itself a declaration of freedom. Often, she is her own most riveting, and revealing, subject. “The tangle of an untold number of limbs, red wine for breakfast,” she writes of one series tellingly called Killing Summer. “At night I walk barefoot along sidewalks. I understand nothing and don’t care. Life is pelting along too fast to understand. I’m rarely sober.” Her raw, imperfect images possess that same chaotic, devil-may-care energy, offering an insider’s eye-witness account of a time and a place with an extraordinary honesty. Simply entitled Evokativ, it is all that and more, one of the must-see shows at Arles.There’s more edgy, street level energy in Restless Bodies, which chronicles post-punk youth culture in East Germany in the 80s, and La Movida: A Chronicle of Turmoil, which looks at youth culture in Spain at roughly the same period. Both shows are uneven but catch the peculiar energy of fragmented European youth cultures that thrived despite the constraints of repression. What comes across most strongly is how subversive ideas, propelled by the template of punk music and graphics, spread like a virus across Europe in a pre-digital era that seems suddenly impossibly distant. Today’s global interconnectivity, in its mesmerising superficiality, seems to work against this kind of subversive – and defiantly local – communal creativity.The anxieties and injustices of our own time are at the heart of Mohamed Bourouissa’s powerful and politically engaged installation, Free Trade, which pointedly is exhibited in a space in Monoprix, a superstore near the railway station. Algerian-born Bourouissa has been working among the marginalised and economically disenfranchised for 15 years, using video, painting, text, drawing and latterly sculpture. In series such as Nous Sommes Les Halles and Périphériques, he engages with the lives of Parisian youths traditionally demonised by politicians and the rightwing press, often presenting narratives that, in their clandestine exchanges, echo the official rituals of power and finance.Bourouissia is a quintessentially contemporary artist, not averse to using reenactments as well as footage shot on surveillance cameras and even stolen smartphones, to create complex images that are a world away from traditional documentary and all the more urgent for that. In a festival where exciting contemporary work is thin on the ground, Free Trade stands out as a challenging, compelling report from the margins.Elsewhere, perhaps in response to the flak the organisers took last year for the paucity of women artists, Arles celebrates pioneering female photographers. Susan Meiselas was deservedly awarded the inaugural Women in Motion prize for her long career as a documentarian whose engagement with her subjects is often deep and sustained. Her still viscerally powerful 1970s series, Carnival Strippers, is on show at Espace Van Gogh, alongside the work of the lesser-known Abigail Heyman, whose 1974 book Growing Up Female – about the ordinary, domestically demanding lives of a generation of women – remains a touchstone of feminist photography. Squeezed between the two, Eve Arnold’s more traditional images, though iconic in their own right, seem oddly out of place.Downstairs, a retrospective of Helen Levitt’s street photography from the 1930s and 40s is one of the crowd-pleasers, with many of the images being shown for the first time. It traces her trajectory from black and white to sumptuous colour, highlighting her eye for gestures – arm movements, bodies crouched or languorous, children moving with balletic grace – and the quiet observational intimacy of many of her snatched portraits. Again, it provides a glimpse of another world when even New York’s streets seemed relatively free of traffic and children could be photographed with impunity.Perhaps it was the punishing heat of Arles, where temperatures hovered around the mid-30s, but I found two vast and very different group shows, Home Sweet Home and Photo Brut, as frustrating as they were fascinating. The former, conceived and curated in France by Isabelle Bonet, looks at the home as a defining aspect of British identity. Ranging a bit too freely through recent depictions of the domestic – from the social documentary approach of Daniel Meadows and David Moore to the more mischievous conceptual strategies of Eva Stenram and Clare Strand, it did not really convince me of “the link between the wellbeing of soul and body and the domestic interior”. Rather, I was reminded again of the essential oddness and insularity of the English, which the French tend to interpret – despite the interminable farce of Brexit – as a kind of lovable eccentricity. A show that doesn’t quite equal the sum of its parts.Like several outsider artists, his work is now highly collectable. More disturbing still is the work of Morton Bartlett, who carved wooden sculptures of pre-pubescent children and then dressed, posed and photographed them. The work has a heightened, almost surreal aura that raises more questions than it answers, but is utterly compelling and, in our censorious climate, more controversial than ever.In a show as sprawling as Photo Brut, a kind of weirdness fatigue inevitably sets in – obsessiveness is exhausting even when glimpsed at a remove – but there are plenty of surprises: imaginary worlds, compulsive cross-dressers, anonymous voyeurs who record their intimate lives or their often bizarre alter egos. If you are unfamiliar with the work of Lee Godie, it is almost worth a visit to to see her work alone. She lived on the streets of downtown Chicago in the 1970s and made photo-booth self-portraits that seem oddly attuned to some of the conceptual photography of the time – Cindy Sherman without the artfulness. An outsider, then, who was utterly in step with the prevailing art currents of the time.In an airless old building by the train station, the shortlisted young artists on the Arles Discovery Award compete in a prize dictated by a public vote. I was taken by Mate Barths’s series, Kontakt, which documents military-style summer camps run by the Hungarian “Home Defence School”, in which often very young children learn survival skills and, in the process, become normalised to weaponry and violence.In contrast, British photographer Alys Tomlinson’s stark, monochrome portraits and landscapes of contemporary pilgrimage sites evince a feeling of deep calm and spiritual rigour. Her short film about a young nun, Vera, who works with wild horses in a convent in Belarus is another highlight, serene and oddly sensual, evoking an inner peace expressed through images of quiet stillness. In the visual overload of the festival, it was good to be reminded of the enduring power of quietly attentive images."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e611b685467c3ff012cf5c0a40819fd62dc19f6d/667_127_6116_3670/master/6116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98d6b3567ed34fa71371b5c177e09bad","title":"manchester international festival review david lynch","story":"Various venues, ManchesterThe Manchester international festival’s art strand features cinematic misery and interactive tech – but it’s Ibrahim Mahama’s work that touches the heartI couldn’t keep up with the number of repurposed shipping containers, the thousands of audio speakers, the nano-printed books on specks of gold, the projected, explosive litter of letters that swam in the indoor firmament of Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s work at Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum. The music of the Cocteau Twins was involved – I don’t know why. Computer pioneers Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace are also invoked in an attempt to capture lost voices from the trembling ether in the MexicanCanadian artist’s show Atmospheric Memory.The title isn’t the only drudge here, in this fog of ideas wraithed in artificial mist and psychobabble. Atmospheric Memory has lots of wow, with its verbal miasmas, voice-activated exhibits, its projections and image-captures of ourselves, surveilled and tracked in our stunned wanderings around his mishmash of an installation.There is too much going on. We are shown the world’s first 3D-printed version of a spoken word (it looks like a misshapen turd) filmed close-ups of vocal chords, opening and closing like weird bivalves and projected into the bottoms of empty oil drums. The actors all had endoscopes down their gullets. As much as this might remind you of Samuel Beckett, Lozano-Hemmer’s gimmicky high-tech art also recalls Mona Hatoum and Susan Hiller, but with more money and much less finesse. It is all overdone. Whisper into a mic and a wall of fog coalesces into the word you’ve just spoken, or a pool of water ripples with the soundwaves. “Go towards the light!” the artist commands as we are herded down a tunnel of amplified seagulls. I ran away.A different approach to language and knowledge is at the core of Tania Bruguera’s School of Integration at Manchester Art Gallery, where a whole floor has been turned into classrooms. Bruguera, quite rightly, insists that integration into a new culture shouldn’t mean leaving your own one behind but using it to enrich the one you’ve entered. This is a call for a multiculturalism currently out of favour. I went to a talk on tea, and the different cultures of tea drinking around the world. There will be cooking, sewing, making things, talking. A haven for people to share experiences and knowledge. Unless they join in, there isn’t much here for visitors. A forum for the pleasure of coming together, and using the gallery as a place in which everyone is a participant, Bruguera’s project is very much in line with Manchester City Art Gallery and the Whitworth’s director Alistair Hudson’s ideas for a “useful museum”.Ibrahim Mahama’s Parliament of Ghosts at the Whitworth is also, in part, an invitation to participate. Beaten-up fibreglass railway carriage seats, sourced from Ghana’s railways but fabricated in Manchester, are lined up in stepped rows. Around them old lockers and shelves are filled with mouldering records of Ghanaian parliamentary debates from the early post-colonial parliament, old schoolbooks, tattered photographs, tangles of lathe shearings, and much besides. There are archive drawers and vitrines. In one, we see a photo of a railway caboose wagon. This is not just for railway buffs. Most affecting is a series of photographs of forearms and hands: every arm tattooed with the name of the itinerant Ghanaian worker it belongs to. They tattooed themselves with their names in case they got injured or killed in their work far from home, so their families could be informed in case of accident. Nothing else here touches me as much.It is all very unheimlich at Home. Divided into five sections, or chapters, in appropriately low-lit galleries, David Lynch’s paintings, prints, drawings and spooky sculpted lamps chart the same territories as his movies: nasty occurrences and creepy, damaged people for whom the world is both challenge and monstrous playground. There’s a young pyromaniac with impossibly long arms and a matchbook, Bob (you may know the name from Twin Peaks), lost in a world of which he has no understanding, as if he has found himself marooned in an Anselm Kiefer painting with weird writing hovering in the sky and between the trees. Around him are houses on fire, floating factories and heads coughing painted muck into the void, as if saying something.There is no real development in Lynch’s art, always the same sour atmosphere, the same writing on his mixed-media paintings, the same evil fun. A hanged girl is suspended from a branch. Another apologises for not knowing the gun was loaded. A photograph of dead flies, all pinned in neat rows, are appended with their names: Harry, Don, Eric, Sid. This is what passes for light relief beside Lynch’s gruesome paintings, with their nasty lumpy inhabitants, their dangling, deformed, slithery, inside-out biologies and mentalities, their tiny doll’s hands pushed into the paint, and the insistent handwritten voice bubbles and commentaries.I like his simple stone lithographs best, with their wayward crayonings and dirty, greasy inks. And the tiny drawings he made on matchbook covers while hanging around on set when he was shooting Eraserhead. It is all of a piece, all-too-believably unbelievable. Lynch the artist might be taken for a character from the world he paints, the madman with the easel, cackling in the attic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d42e8b29ad5c2107be8cfef722f01310b266b0/251_572_5447_3268/master/5447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bde252564923fc8ec2efc1d1b9e297aa","title":"prix pictet 2019 shortlist photo essay","story":"The shortlist of 12 photographers selected for the eighth cycle of the Prix Pictet, the global award in photography and sustainability, was announced last night on the theme of Hope at a presentation at the opening of Les Rencontres d’Arles international photography festivalThe winner of the Prix Pictet will be announced on 13 November 2019, with the opening of an exhibition of works by the 12 shortlisted photographers at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. On an 18-month cycle, the award focuses on a theme that promotes discussion and debate on issues of sustainability, awarding 100,000 Swiss francs (£80,700) to the work that speaks most powerfully to the theme of the award.The theme for this cycle is Hope, which offers a wide range of creative possibilities and a strong set of connections to the overriding theme of sustainability: hope in the face of adversity, recycling, reforestation, rewilding, science – with a look at advances in medicine and technological solutions for global environmental problems – and the reduction of poverty levels. Shahidul Alam, born in 1955 in Bangladesh, based in Dhaka“Gang raped numerous times as a child, forced into pickpocketing, caned until unconscious, sold to a madame, Hajera Begum’s life has little that would give cause to smile. Yet she smiles. She cries too. Not because of the gang rapes, or the beating, or the many years she lived in the streets as a ragpicker, but when she remembers that a man who worked at an NGO refused to work in her team because she was a sex worker.”“When I first met Hajera in 1996, she was a sex worker in Dhaka. We became friends, and she and her friends would often visit us in our flat, which would be considered an unacceptable act in most Bangladeshi homes.She said: ‘You hugged me today when you saw me in the street, just like the old times. That’s something men will never do. They will have sex with me, grope me in the dark, rape me if they get the chance, but they will never hug me, as a sister, as a friend. That is what I want for my children. That they will grow up with dignity, in a world where they will be loved.’”The photographer, writer, curator and activist Shahidul Alam studied in London before returning to his hometown, Dhaka, in 1984, where he documented the democratic struggle to remove  General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was in power from 1983 to 1990.Joana Choumali, born in 1974 in Ivory Coast, based in Abidjan“In Ivory Coast, people do not discuss their psychological issues or feelings. A post-traumatic state is often considered a weakness or a mental disease. People hardly talk about their feelings, and each conversation is quickly shortened by a resigned ‘ça va aller’. This work is a way to address the way Ivorian people deal with trauma and mental health.Joana Choumali is visual artist and photographer based in Abidjan, in Ivory Coast. She works mainly on conceptual portraits, mixed media and documentary photography.Margaret Courtney-Clarke, born in 1949 in Namibia, based in SwakopmundSeries: Cry Sadness into the Coming Rain, 2014-2018This series opens a new phase in Courtney-Clarke’s photographic work, documenting the artist’s return to Namibia and her engagement with its people and landscape in crisis.“Namibia is steeped in history dating from the earliest inhabitants – Khoi, Bushmen, Herero, Namaqua, Damara – to German occupation, to the South Africans and apartheid, and now to ‘liberation’ and statehood – a nation of erse peoples and cultures in a vast land of seeming nothingness and unparalleled light. I seek out the traces of their passing on the land.”“Cry Sadness into the Coming Rain is a record of this social process, which has always hinged on the fragility of hope. The existential world of the people I photograph is located in an unforgiving environment where life is precarious: little or no rain, scarce water and food, people abandoned by their government and forced to migrate to flee the emptiness ... Their only anchor is the expectation that life will persist against these odds.”After studying art and photography in South Africa, Margaret Courtney-Clarke spent the next four decades working as a photographer in Italy, the US and across Africa.Rena Effendi, born in 1977 in Baku, Azerbaijan, based in Istanbul, TurkeySeries: Transylvania: Built on Grass, 2012“For centuries, the small villages in Transylvania have preserved their hay meadows, raised cattle and operated self-sustainable farms. The agrarian fairytale extinct in western Europe still exists here, in bucolic scenes where young boys learn to cut and rake hay by hand, where all village women know how to weave and all men can build a house from scratch. In this old world, defined by traditional belief systems and respect for the environment, one does not trample a meadow of high grass before mowing it, the cows and horses find their way home along the muddy village tracks and the rivers’ water is busy with the milling, washing and alcohol making.”“Having survived the collectivisation of Ceausescu’s communist regime, this fragile rural environment now faces the modern threat of industrialisation and globalisation as a result of Romania’s 2007 entry into the European Union. This world is on the brink of extinction, as local small-scale farmers cannot compete with the European imports and industrialised agricultural production, and as youngsters leave the countryside in search for work in the cities of western Europe.”Born in Azerbaijan, Rena Effendi lives and works in Istanbul, Turkey. Educated as a linguist, Effendi’s early work focused on the oil industry’s effects on people’s lives in her region.Lucas Foglia, born in 1983 in the US, based in San Francisco“Conservationists often disagree about how humankind should best move forward from the damage it has already done. Traditionalists argue we should put a boundary around wild spaces to preserve them, but there is no way to contain the effects of people. More radical conservationists propose moving all people to green cities, supplied with renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, to allow the countryside to re-wild itself.”“Responding to this debate, I befriended and photographed people who are working towards a positive environmental future despite the enormity of the task. Human Nature is a series of interconnected stories about our reliance on the natural world and the science that fosters our relationship to it. Each story is set in a different ecosystem: city, forest, farm, desert, ice field, ocean and lava flow. From a newly built rainforest in urban Singapore to a Hawaiian research station measuring the cleanest air on Earth, the photographs examine our need for ‘wild’ places – even when those places are human constructions.”Lucas Foglia grew up on a farm in New York and currently lives in San Francisco. His third book, Human Nature, was recently published by Nazraeli Press.Janelle Lynch, born in 1969 in the US, based in New YorkSeries: Another Way of Looking at Love, 2015-2018“This series explores the interconnectedness of all life forms and supports a renewal of human relationships to each other, and to the natural and the spiritual worlds.For some images, I create points of connection with elements from the same species – Japanese barberry or burdock, for example – while for others, I combine multiple species, such as goldenrod and pokeweed or burning bush and pine trees. Points of connection create spaces, which represent areas where new realities can be envisioned. The depiction of unity, together with colour and light, show the beauty and magic of the natural world.”“Another Way of Looking at Love follows the belief that in our organic and spiritual essence, we are inextricably linked to each other and to Mother Nature ... Our wellness and the well-being of the world depend on healthy connections to each other and to the earth.”Janelle Lynch is an American large-format photographer investigating themes of absence, presence, transcendence and the life cycle through the landscapes and waterways of the US, Mexico and Spain.Ross McDonnell, born 1979 in Ireland, based in New YorkLimbs shows a set of improvised prosthetic legs that the artist captured at the International Committee of the Red Cross orthopedic hospital in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan. Patients who came to receive their new custom fitted limb often would leave their old one behind. They were kept at the hospital and displayed on the wall. One health worker said: “It would be impossible to count the number of people who have lost limbs as a result of conflict in Afghanistan.”The hospital serves the semi-permanent battle space that has come to define eastern Afghanistan throughout the country’s 40 years of near-continuous conflict. For McDonnell, Limbs served to anthropomorphise the resilience and optimism of the Afghan people he spent years documenting.Ross McDonnell is a film-maker and photographer from Dublin, Ireland. McDonnell’s work in long-term documentary projects focuses on themes of sustainability, conflict, migration and ecology.Gideon Mendel, born 1959 in South Africa, based in LondonSeries: Damage: A Testament of Faded Memory, 2016“These images emerge from a time of hope, activism and tragedy. In the 1980s, I was part of a young generation of ‘struggle photographers’ in South Africa, documenting the fight against apartheid. In 1990 I left a box of my outtakes (negatives and transparencies) in storage in Johannesburg, and forgot about it. A few years ago, they were returned to me and I discovered that, in their many years of neglect, the box had been rained on, and the top layers had been affected by moisture and mould.”“Hope and tragedy seem so closely intertwined in my recollections of this period. It was a moment where the hegemony and power of the apartheid state seemed insurmountable in all its brutality, yet in response there was such heroic idealism within the township mobilisation that I witnessed.”Gideon Mendel began photographing in the 1980s, during the final years of apartheid. It was his work during this period that first brought his photographs to global attention.Ivor Prickett, born 1983 in Ireland, based in Europe and the Middle EastSeries: End of the Caliphate, 2016-2018“This selection of images is not an all-encompassing view of war, but rather a beacon of strength in the midst of terrible hardship. They can give us hope despite the challenges we face as a global community.Nadhira sat in a plastic chair 15 feet (4.5 metres) from where an excavator was digging through the ruins of her home in Mosul’s Old City. At times she was engulfed in dust, whipped up as the driver dumped mounds of stone and parts of her house beside her, but she refused to move. Slowly they found the remains of her sister and niece, who had been killed when the house was flattened by an airstrike in the final weeks of a battle to defeat Isis in Mosul in the summer of 2017.”“The levels of violence and killing I witnessed while doing this work were beyond comprehension. During the two years I spent documenting the battle to defeat Isis and its aftermath in Iraq and Syria, I struggled to see the high cost of the war as anything but disastrous. In Mosul alone, the death toll was estimated to be more than 9,000 and vast tracts of the city were left in ruins. However, I also saw glimmers of hope for humanity amid the rubble-strewn aftermath. Meeting Nadhira was one of those moments.”Based in the region since 2009, Ivor Prickett documented the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Libya, working simultaneously on editorial assignments and his own long-term projects.Robin Rhode, born 1976 in South Africa, based in BerlinSeries: Principle of Hope, 2017“These disenfranchised youths have become my studio assistants and collaborators in this unique art-making process. The walls are painted in brightly coloured palettes to trigger psychological perception and to embrace mathematics and geometry as an educative tool to assist in developing reason and logic in the minds of young people.”The Berlin-based multidisciplinary artist engages in a variety of visual languages such as photography, performance, drawing and sculpture using materials such as soap, charcoal, chalk and paint.Awoiska van der Molen, born 1972 in the Netherlands, based in Amsterdam“When I came across the phrase ‘Im schwarzen Himmelsrund’ in the composer Gustav Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde, it immediately struck me as the perfect title for a selection of my photo works. Himmelsrund, which literally translates as the heavens’ rim, was used in the middle ages to refer to the celestial firmament as a vaulted disc. This juxtaposition of the ine and the astronomic resonates with my process and my constant quest as a photographer, since my solitary journeys in nature resemble those of the classic pilgrim or anchorite. We share that sense of hope present in alchemist, spiritual and even Christian beliefs, a conviction that there must be a higher plane of existence to which humanity once had access, but with which it lost substantive contact.”“Since the start of my artistic practice 16 years ago , my aim has always been to try to get as close as possible to some true, unspoilt core of a place. By peeling off all the many layers of today’s roaring world, I slowly eliminate all distractions in order to hear, see and experience my surroundings with clean senses.”Awoiska van der Molen is a Dutch artist working with the medium of photography.Alexia Webster, born 1979 in South Africa, based in New York“All the years I was growing up, hanging in the hallway of my childhood home in South Africa was an old black-and-white photograph of my grandparents, my great uncles and my mother as a toddler, posing in a photographer’s studio. They were recent economic migrants to South Africa from a small village on a little island in Greece. I would stare for hours at the photograph, my grandparents looking young and glamorous, dressed in their finest at my three-year-old mother, sitting obediently with curls in her hair at the studio painted backdrop of a misty romantic scene. Although they had just left their whole world behind in search of a better life, to me they looked like elegant characters from a tale my grandmother would tell. This family photograph, of all the images I have, is my most treasured.”“First created in March 2011, the Street Studios project is a communal family photo album that began with the set-up of free outdoor photographic studios on more than 20 street corners and public spaces around the world. In each community we visited, we created public photo studio sets and invited any passing families and iniduals to pose for a portrait. With thousands of photographs taken over almost an eight-year period, Street Studios is an archive of family and love, an archive that documents not what makes things fall apart but what keeps them together.”Alexia Webster is a South African photographer and visual artist. Her work explores ideas of intimacy, family and identity across the African continent and beyond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6b75b6f3768984ac23510a084001134928ffc29/0_352_6708_4025/master/6708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e44d44e39f4162ecfafbba4ae05a902","title":"restoration rembrandt night watch begins rijksmuseum amsterdam","story":"Elaborate process will be livestreamed from Amsterdam’s RijksmuseumThe restorers, data experts and art historians at the Rijksmuseum call it Operation Night Watch. “Because it is like a military operation in the planning,” said Taco Dibbits, the museum’s general director.At 9am on Monday, as the doors of the Amsterdam museum open to the public, the largest and most elaborate public art restoration in history will begin.In a specially constructed seven sq metre glass chamber, a team of 12 experts will work to bring back to its former glory one of the world’s most spectacular paintings: The Night Watch by Rembrandt.The process will not only be performed in front of the public, in the building built in 1885 as a “cathedral of the arts”, where The Night Watch occupies the “high altar” in the museum’s gallery of honour, but will be livestreamed to millions around the world.Beyond conserving the painting for generations to come – it was last restored in 1975 following a knife attack by a Dutch teacher – it is hoped that an initial 10-month research stage using the most sophisticated technology will bring new insights into how Rembrandt van Rijn made his masterpiece in 1642, whether he did, as is believed, make a preparatory sketch across the vast canvas and what changes he made along the way.But the next 48 hours of the operation will be critical.Over the last two weeks, an iron frame into which plates of clear glass can fit to form the restoration case has been constructed in a warehouse just outside Ghent in Belgium. The team did one practice run putting it all together, but there were some precarious moments. “You have to gain the experience of moving such long glass plates and that was not easy,” said Dibbits. “None broke, but it was very good to do that before.”On Saturday the construction of the chamber will be completed – on the spot where The Night Watch is viewed by 2 million people every year. The painting was moved a week ago to a different part of the gallery of honour to allow for preparations. “It was always wisest to move the painting well out of the way and not build the glass case around it,” Dibbits said.After the last visitors have left the Rijksmuseum on Sunday afternoon, about 25 people will start the arduous task of transporting the 337kg painting into the waiting chamber and on to a tripod-like imaging frame, a job that is expected to take until midnight.The Night Watch has been moved only a handful of times in the last 150 years, including its transportation into a bunker in the coastal dunes at the start of the second world war, and later in the conflict into mines in the south of the Netherlands.“Any move of any painting, especially The Night Watch, which is such a large painting, you always have to be very careful and it is very precisely done,” said Dibbits. “It is moved from the wall by hand and then hydraulic lifts on to a kind of cart especially constructed for it on wheels, and then it is pushed into the glass case which has one very high door which enables it to move it there without barely any vibrations.”On Monday morning, Dibbits will offer the gathering crowds and online viewers an introduction to the team working on the masterpiece. “And then we will let them get to work,” he said.Dibbits said that because the painting has always been on view even those who knew it best had much to learn. “I have been working there for 17 years and I have never seen the top of the painting – you can’t just put a ladder in front of it. We know so little on how he worked on making The Night Watch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ef5b4172f547d9e8439f7af967074dc18f01da/0_69_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eb6e6365b65ac6e1dc3de42f15a0b80","title":"revealed how london parks are partly privatised festivals wireless finsbury park","story":"Exclusive figures show extent to which London councils are using parks for ticketed music festivals such as Wireless and other paid events to plug budget gapsAs chugging guitars reverberated over Finsbury Park last Sunday afternoon, crowds streamed through the Manor House gate past a banner commemorating the park’s 150th anniversary. Next to it was another temporary sign: “Welcome! Your park is open as usual.” The statement was at best disingenuous – the gates were certainly open, and so were many of the facilities, but it rather overlooked the 49,000-capacity festival surrounded by 12-foot-high grey metal fencing and audible a mile away.The festival was called Community, but at £50 a ticket, and with a narrow lineup of indie rock, it’s not that kind of community festival. Outside the perimeter fencing a father and two children on their bikes took advice from security staff in hi-vis jackets on where they were still able to cycle, and when the fencing would come down.In Blur’s 1994 single, it was “all the people” who went hand-in-hand through their parklife. In 2019 London, we should be so lucky. The rapid rise of city-based summer music festivals has become the latest fight in the attritional war over the privatisation of public space, which now includes the question of who has the right to use London’s parks in the warmest months of the year.Exclusive new figures obtained by  Cities through freedom of information (FoI) requests show that London’s councils are hiring out public parks for commercial, paid-for events, such as music festivals, for large portions of the summer. Local authorities were asked how many festival days would see parks be off-limits to local residents during May-August because of events with an entry fee: of the 30 out of 32 councils that responded, the outer London boroughs of Brent and Enfield scored the highest, with 41 and 42 days respectively Hackney and Southwark, with 35 and 38 days, scored the highest in inner London.Moreover, as park users know, it’s not just the days when the festivals are taking place that are disruptive: the heavy-duty stage infrastructure and fencing require days or sometimes weeks to set up and de-rig, cutting off access to substantial parts of London’s parks for large portions of the summer. Councils were also asked how long that infrastructure would stay up: in many cases this number was more than 40 days in Enfield’s case, over 100, the equivalent of a major park being privatised for more than three months.“Parks have become a very significant commodity,” says University of Westminster academic Andrew Smith, whose research focuses on live events and urban tourism. He says the last decade has seen a much greater use of parks for big commercial music festivals, sporting and entertainment events. “We live in what is called an ‘experience economy’ now, where these kinds of events are an increasingly large part of the way in which people spend their money.”Inevitably, the largest, loudest and longest-lasting events attract the highest hire fee. “It’s very much a financial calculation,” he says. “And it’s all combined with the overriding context, which is increasing concern about the restriction of access to public space – I think people are more aware now of this issue of privatisation of public space.”Opposition to the commercial use of the parks is growing. Angry residents are organising to demand access to fenced-off parks and contesting damage to plants and wildlife, as well as noise and anti-social behaviour. The campaign by residents near Battersea Park against Formula E racing eventually triumphed, and the race has not returned.In north London, meanwhile, Friends of Finsbury Park has mounted a high-profile struggle against the summer festivals there, particularly over the noise and anti-social behaviour connected to Wireless festival. In October 2018, it secured licence conditions that included lower volume limits, and a restriction on “vulgar, obscene or banned songs”, and even “vulgar gestures, actions or remarks during the performance”.These objections drew accusations of Nimbyism and of racist undertones, as Wireless has become Britain’s premier black music festival. But for Simon Hunt, chair of the group, the problem isn’t Wireless festival per se.“It’s not just the days where the events are on, but the weeks either side,” he said, echoing the FoI results. “By the time the festivals are finally gone, there are huge parts of the park without any grass any more, there’s litter strewn everywhere, broken pathways and fences.”He also emphasises the group’s fears that Haringey council has been using their local park as a cash cow to fund depleted parks services.“Ten years ago this wasn’t really a huge issue,” Hunt said. “There would be one festival or concert every year or two. But five years ago, Haringey decided to change their major events policy to allow for up to five major festivals a year in Finsbury Park, and an unlimited number of smaller festivals. And suddenly the number of events increased enormously.”Indeed, the phenomenon seems linked to the equally strong desire to keep parks free at a time of squeezed council budgets. Enfield council’s head of finance and procurement, Mary Maguire, points the finger at austerity.“As a result of government spending cuts and increased pressures on services, Enfield council has had to save £178m since 2010. In 201920 alone, we have to save £18m,” she said. “As such it is more important than it has ever been for local authorities to explore a range of different commercial opportunities to raise revenue.” Maguire also said Enfield was one of the greenest boroughs, and most of its parks were open and event-free all summer.Other campaigners are less worried about noise and disruption and more about the growing normalisation of privatisation. One of British parks’ key institutional backers, the Heritage Lottery Fund, has recently encouraged local authorities to replace grant income with commercial income. It has created Prosperous Parks, “a green space income generation toolkit”, and pushed advertising, sponsorship and other commercial activities in parks, as well as hiring for live events.“There are several boroughs actively aiming for a zero-pound parks budget now,” Andrew Smith says. “They want to see their parks entirely self-financed: there’s an implicit idea that the parks should pay for themselves.”In other parks, such as Gunnersbury, management has shifted away from local authority control to a community interest company, which could effectively privatise park governance and put it beyond the democratic accountability that local authorities still face.And yet, Hunt suggests, there is some optimism. He says their group is now consulted comprehensively by council and festival organisers alike, and has succeeded in establishing a legal clarification that revenue generated by events must be spent in the specific park it came from. “It’s quite funny,” says Hunt, “because the council weren’t expecting this legal precedent to be set, so they’ve been scrambling to find ways to spend money in Finsbury Park, because they have to.”Some commenters argue that there is a progressive case to be made for festivals in parks beyond raising revenues, such as disrupting staid Victorian identities and encouraging people of all ages, classes and races to use them. If bandstands were built specifically as platforms for the popular public entertainment of the 19th century, when most of these parks were established, why shouldn’t they now host the pop music of 2019?For Andrew Smith, unpicking the extent to which local campaigners are just getting worked up about cigarette butts in the flower beds is vital to understanding the role parks play in the 21st-century city. “Most of these opponents aren’t just moaners, complaining about a bit of noise on a Saturday night,” he says. “Some of them have been defending their local parks for decades, against various forms of development, and they see these festivals as only the latest threat.“A lot of people see parks as the last vestiges of public democracy, accessible for everyone. And there aren’t many places like that left.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25667802b6a67df5486cdfad7cc88eedc287b62a/5_47_1746_1048/master/1746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46876c6d3d30d7795d0738bbcef1d7f7","title":"the colour and calm of copenhagen a cartoon","story":"The Illustrated City: Danish capital is spirited and busy but there are nooks of tranquillity, says urban sketcher João AlbergariaA popular square in the centre of a multicultural neighbourhood, Nørrebro, Blågårds Plads hosts street markets, concerts and demonstrations. It is considered something of an alternative location, a bit out of the context of the city, partly because of the large communities of Arab and African people in the area.There are also many stores that sell secondhand or recycled products.It is a very busy area, but the trees lend the square tranquillity, projecting fantastic shadows on the pavement.It was the start of spring and lots of people were outside enjoying the weather – I tried to capture the spirit of the crowded square and the beautiful light.Frederiksholms Kanal is the largest artificial canal built in the centre of Copenhagen in the 17th century. Along the canal are landmark buildings of Copenhagen – Christiansborg palace, parliament, the National Museum – as well as old warehouse buildings, beautiful bridges and hundreds of boats.In this particular scene, what struck me most were the vivid colours of the boats against the surroundings on a winter’s day.During Denmark’s long, dark winter, life in the boats stops and they are left alone until the springtime weather arrives.This 360-degree view means a lot to me. I worked in the area for three years and this drawing was done in several days. Every day I did a small part and it was a challenge because I needed to connect all the parts together.There are several important buildings in the drawing, such as Nikolaj Kunsthal, parliament, the National Museum, Museum Thorvaldsen and Christiansborg palace.It was a privilege to work in the Gammel Strand area. It is a very old part of the city with remarkably beautiful buildings. The name means the old beach, and is where the fish market used to be.Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (New Carlsberg) is a Danish art museum founded by Carl Jacobsen and opened to the public in 1906. It is one of the most important museums of Copenhagen, with a big collection of classic works and contemporary art. I have wandered around the exhibits many times, but this time I thought I should honour the beautiful orange building.It is always crowded, but has a wonderful patio inside with palm trees.In the summer there are lots of tourists in the city, who always head straight to the museums and places indicated on tourist maps and travel websites. The areas between Tivoli (Europe’s oldest entertainment park), Glytoptek and Central Station are always full of tourists. I like to observe the new visitors to the city I find their reactions and movements amusing.On the day I sketched this, it was quite hot and I just wanted to stay for ever on the street to enjoy this rare (for Copenhagen) weather.It is easy to imagine stories when drawing, and I often imagine the lives of the people who built the buildings, the challenges, the empty spaces that are being completed.HC Andersens Boulevard is one of the main streets of Copenhagen, with a mix of old and new buildings. I really enjoy sketching old buildings with lots of decoration. It makes me focused – it’s like putting a puzzle together.This building is imposing and I always wonder about what is going on inside. I do not know if people live there, or whether it is offices or something else entirely. This mystery keeps my imagination active.This harbour is in an area where the new city is expanding. Lots of new, vulgar and misguided, construction is springing up. This drawing was a kind of tribute to a big effort made by residents to keep the harbour small and less developed and to the memory of a place that is in the process of disappearing.I always like to find places to draw where there is some controversy or discussion about the place. In this case, little remains of the spirit of the original harbour it has become artificial with horrible new edifices around it.It is sad that part of the history of the city is disappearing. I think the boats that remain are magical. Some of them have become like exclusive and expensive hotels, but there is still a small remnant of port life – only very little, but something survives. I really appreciate this effort.Like all the central stations in Europe’s big capital cities, it’s a peculiar place, with lots of people coming and going.The roof is made of a beautiful wood structure supported by stone columns.It was an extremely cold day, and even though I was drawing indoors I had to wear lots of layers of clothing, which affected my sketching skills and agility.A city’s central station is a place where momentous things happen. It is a place of meetings and disagreements of new beginnings and departures.I made this sketch on the rooftop of Rundetaarn, one of the highest spots of the city. Copenhagen is a flat city and most of the buildings don’t have more than five or six floors I like how towers make it possible to pick out the different squares and locations.The light was beautiful on that summer’s day.I decided to go to the top of the tower a bit by chance. The tower building itself is rather ugly and uninteresting, but I thought the view could be interesting. And it was – that magnificent view over Copenhagen and that intense light. From the top of the tower you can see all the significant landmarks. Steeples and high roofs that are normally attached to important city buildings, such as churches, City Hall and other civil buildings, are located in squares. So using that as a starting point, it is possible to read the layout of the whole city. The towers link the axes of the city, marking the key points of entry to the old city.Palæ is an emblematic bar of Copenhagen. There was a great jazz concert in the day I did the sketch and at the end the musicians wanted to sign my original drawing. What a honour.The space was crowded but I was lucky and got a place right in front of the musicians. From up close you can feel their expressive intensity, see the head movements, long moments with closed eyes. It was a great opportunity to draw the scene.The logo of the cafe is brilliant: a reference to the little mermaid, one of the symbols of the city.Sydhavn is a beautiful harbour outside the city centre. Is it still a fishing harbour and also has a lot of old boat houses. It is my favourite spot to sketch in Copenhagen I feel at home and welcomed by the people who live there.Sydhavn is an oasis in the city, an old fishing port lost in the greatly expanding new city of Copenhagen.More than being just an old fishing port, Sydhavn has the soul of alternative dimension: people who live there seem completely apart from the accelerated rhythm of the rest of the city. The atmosphere in Sydhavm has a different rhythm I cannot identify a trace of stress.Going to Sydhavn to draw works like therapy for me when I have had one of those days of intense and stressful work.There is a huge pressure of real estate investors to destroy the port and build those blocks of horrible apartments that look the same wherever you are in the world.But for now, drawing the boats of Sydhanvn is a great pleasure: I love to unravel their secrets and memories. The boats speak for themselves they have souls and they survive.Tivoli is the oldest amusement park in Europe and the Danish are extremely proud of it. Drawing symbols of the city is always a challenge and a huge responsibility. I tried to get the overall view of the building and then used a fish-eye perspective, which gives an expressive dynamic grammar to a drawing.Vaenedamsvej is one of the busiest shopping streets in Vesterbro: huge cafes and shops that sell almost everything line up one after the other. Residents of Copenhagen go to this street to buy things they need but also to relax. There is a dynamism in the shops and cafes, nothing is boring. There are bicycles everywhere and the cafes put tables outside once the weather improves.Also, for me, the bikes in the foreground are an icon of the city.I like the ersity of the building on the city corner it makes the city feel alive, and it is easy to see lots of things happening at once because of the dynamic of the location.I often like to look for nooks and crannies to draw, and in Vesterbro you can find a lot of them.This place where Viktoriagade crosses Vesterbrogade is particularly interesting for its architectural ersity. Here, several buildings of different epochs and proportions are connected.João Paulo Albergaria is a Portuguese architect who has lived in Copenhagen since 2012.

The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is doing a live piece to camera from Downing Street, when an upper window of No 10 opens behind her. As she speaks, bin bags full of Boris Johnson’s clothes begin to be thrown from it, punctuated by various high-pitched reflections on his character. Like I say, it’s just a fictional vignette, set 10 minutes into a dystopian future. But would you honestly rule it out? Just over a fortnight before the money shot of the Tory leadership contest, very little seems impossible in our increasingly trashy country.After all, this is a week in which England – and it is always England – has once again been embarrassed by the behaviour of travelling fans. Fans of Nigel Farage, in this case, with the spectacle of his Brexit party MEPs turning their backs on a live performance of the European anthem at the opening of the new European parliament session in Strasbourg. We have seen it so many times before, of course – this pack mentality, this unprovoked loutishness, this excruciatingly entitled sense that it is acceptable, even imperative, to colonise a public space and behave absurdly rudely in it.However, we have hitherto tended to see it outside a designated bar in, say, the old port in Marseille, one day before a football international, rather than in the debating chamber of a 28-state parliament. In terms of intellect, deliberate offence and filthy manners, there really is nothing to choose between a shirtless England fan singing 10 German Bombers while threatening to chuck some cafeteria furniture, and Ann Widdecombe ranting at MEPs that Brexit was comparable to slaves rising up against their owners.Back home, thanks to this necrotic country’s absolute commitment to providing its own metaphors, we learn that there is an acute burial crisis in the UK. We need new ideas for how to dispose of our rising count of corpses, says a leading public health expert, who recommends burying them alongside motorways. Still, at least one tomb has surely been vacated by Widders, that hard-right Havisham, whose desiccated bigotry and cobwebbed inhumanity has been exhumed with her election as a Brexit party MEP, as well as reminding us that the border between Celebrity Big Brother and public service is basically nonexistent. There really is something of the shite about her.Widdecombe is naturally regarded as a huge asset by her party leader, who has long been the red item in the UK’s white wash. Farage loves to perpetuate a certain image of himself, deliberately wearing tweed suits even in Washington DC and so on. He repetitively harks back to some bygone era, when the stereotypical Englishman abroad was the model of urbanity. Alas, as anyone who’s been on a late-night Ryanair flight will agree, this is no longer the stereotype. Farage might imagine he’s cosplaying as David Niven, but stunts such as the one in Strasbourg should remind us he is in fact just another big-drinking Brit who might as well be pissing in a European street on a stag weekend.Bad manners, unprovoked aggression, going through the non-EU passport queue even though you don’t yet have to – all these are clear elements of the emerging Brexit style. For former newspaper the Daily , Johnson is its most exquisite embodiment. “Mr Johnson IS Mr Brexit,” declared its leader column today. “He is also a triumph of a very British kind of style as well as substance – and what is wrong with that?” Guys, I know you’ve only had 30 years of warning, but you’re going to kick yourself when you find out.Then again, you don’t even have to be in frontline politics to feel that Johnson’s your route to a job. The Times story about George Osborne’s bid to become IMF president features the following crystallisation of British public life: “Mr Osborne will need the nomination of Britain’s next prime minister to succeed. The Evening Standard, which he edits, recently endorsed Boris Johnson in the leadership race.”The Financial Times unearthed further horror in its report that Johnson could call a snap general election. Or as one of his backers chose to put it: “He could say ‘I’m the daddy’.” I can picture at least three discrete settings in which Johnson might indeed say those words, each of them more grotesque than the last. But it’s unclear quite what else they expect, when Johnson currently exists in the shadows, like a late-era Brando playing Struwwelpeter.That said, the one thing we do know is that Johnson is less unkempt than he was. It’s genuinely remarkable how many of the wanky articles on “The New Johnson” a) can only be responded to with the exhortation “wake the fuck up”, and b) contain extensive extrapolative reference to the fact he’s had a haircut. I mean, well done to the manscaped Dulux dog and everything. But could the bar honestly be any lower? I fully expect to read he’s been housebroken in recent weeks.For now, the prime-minister-in-waiting is still having little irony-related accidents. Or as his sign-off to today’s Darlington hustings ran: “If only we could see ourselves as others see us.” If only indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca25d015793bfa150ed5f1965e79e4180ab32e5/0_173_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=575354ecc06217e290832501905dee5a","title":"the guardian view on the climate emergency forests can help to save us","story":"There is so much bad news about the climate emergency that it is easy to sink into a heatstruck daze and suppose that we can do nothing to prevent catastrophic global change over the next 50 years. This would be a mistake. There are still things to be done which will diminish future damage and – more hopefully still – undo the effects of some of our past crimes against the environment.Research has just shown that there is far more land in the world on which trees can be planted than anyone had supposed. This matters. There is no doubt that reforestation must form part of any strategy to diminish the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and so avert the kind of temperature rise that will cause a civilisational breakdown as the seas rise and the deserts spread on land. The new estimates show that with a truly heroic effort, it would be possible to plant or allow to regrow enough trees around the world to remove from the atmosphere two-thirds of the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities. The figures involved are boggling: a trillion trees, covering in total an area as large as the US and China combined. The total cost is estimated at $300bn, a figure to make even a Bezos blink. But the prize is almost beyond price. Without the sequestration of carbon the world will bust through 1.5C of warming and head for much worse. Planting trees is by far the least expensive and most practicable way available at present to do this.It won’t be enough, of course. Important – vital – as these efforts are to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and undo some of the damage we have done in the last century, they will be wholly inadequate without a corresponding effort to stop the production of more greenhouse gases. Here the signs remain extremely gloomy. The time for change was yesterday. A study published in Nature this week shows that the power plants already built, under construction or planned will all by themselves consume enough fossil fuels and emit enough carbon to break the 1.5C barrier and probably the 2C one as well. Any serious attempt to stabilise the climate even at that uncomfortable level must start with a commitment to plan no more power stations that run on fossil fuels, and to lower drastically the number of planned ones that are actually built.When measured against the size of the challenge, even a reforestation plan on this scale does not appear ambitious. But it is, in political and economic terms, especially when measured against the willingness up to now of politicians and consumers to do what they must. The most obvious obstacle is the raging pace of deforestation in the world today, especially in the tropics. Last year was the third worst since proper records from satellite images began in 2002 and unlike the two worse ones, the damage recorded in 2018 was all done directly by humans, rather than by fires.Although the government of Indonesia, previously one of the worst offenders, has managed to reduce the amount of land being lost to palm oil plantations, the real problem lies in Brazil, where the land is cleared, often in a very wasteful way, for soya beans and pasture – both used for meat production – and the populist rightwing Bolsonaro government appears to be deliberately accelerating the pace of forest destruction. Reforestation and the preservation of existing forests is also a marker of the way in which the green movement is not just about economics. It must also speak to our spiritual sides if it is to mobilise a global coalition. Trees, and still more forests, do not just remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They seem to suck some of the darkness and self-obsession out of the humans in their shade. They remind us that we share the earth with life forms older than we can imagine and stranger than we can ever understand, and that we’re bound to them in webs of mutual interdependence. Preserving and restoring the great forests would be worth doing for itself even if it had no economic use. But the climate emergency means that this plan is also a precondition if the next century is to have much more than a subsistence economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a65ab1aecb4921457f3db7f7fad29dc0f2d73dd/209_531_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa11d7e78ea045b82e7291ea4af1b48b","title":"share photos of wildflower and planted meadows and verges near you","story":"If you have seen any planted meadows or verges by roads or public spaces, we would like to hear from youBritish conservation charity Plantlife’s campaign to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges has seen some councils take the message seriously.Posting on Twitter, Bex Langley wrote about the eight miles of flowers planted along a major road in Rotherham thanks to the local council.The group’s road verge campaign started in 2013 in response to the mowing down of wildflowers – flowers which are not intentionally seeded or planted.

As with any clothes, they are a way of presenting ourselves to the world. And for some, that means wearing top hats, breeches, doublets, or Bakelite jewellery. Below, six period dressers explain their choices:These are everyday clothes of the early 19th century. I never leave the house without a hat and I tend to walk around with a cane, too. A lot of what I wear at the moment is Regency style.I’ve been dressing alternatively since I was 14 because modern fashion has never appealed to me. I wanted to look back to a time when things were of a higher quality and wear clothes that would make me stand out. I began wearing late-Victorian and Edwardian stuff bought in vintage shops in Brighton and it made me genuinely happy. I got into the Regency look because I was invited to a Regency ball in London and had nothing to wear. I tried to make something myself, but realised it was terrible since I couldn’t find the right fabrics, so I decided to research the history and develop my own skills.The Regency period was the last hurrah of men’s fun with fashion, when people could be loud with colour and exuberant. The jackets, cravats, trousers – all of it is just wonderful to wear. It’s comfortable, too, and since I make it all myself, it makes me proud to have it on. It’s also a great ice-breaker.My clothes take time and it’s all about learning to be slow, rather than buying into fast fashion, which is unethical and so removed from the production process. You are who you are and you have to get on with it I feel very much at home in what I wear and how I wear it.I haven’t really had any backlash – people have been very inquisitive and polite to me. I don’t see jeans in my future. If anything, I see something more extreme.My style is 1940s and 50s inspired. When I was in my early 20s, I was living in Australia and I started going to secondhand shops because I didn’t have much money. I realised I could buy all the princess dresses that I loved as a little girl cheaply so I started with 1980s clothes and then worked my way back, before settling on the 40s as my style. It’s more comfortable for me and it’s very girly when I cut my hair short, I didn’t want to look boyish, so these clothes are lovely and feminine.When I dress, it makes me feel like myself. I’m in awe of people who look good in just a white T-shirt and jeans, but this style gives me that comfort. Dressing up brings so much joy into my life: sometimes, when I’m sad, I just want to wear colourful clothes because they cheer me up and make me want to go out.In my experience, it’s rare to see people of colour in the vintage scene. I think it might be because we’re already minorities, so we don’t want to draw more attention to ourselves by virtue of the clothes we’re wearing. I grew up with being westernised as the goal, and vintage clothing from my culture highlights the fact that I’m different and, in the current political climate, perhaps sometimes we don’t want to be different.The most important thing is that people wear clothes that are more sustainable and that they use them. Vintage clothes are made to last and it’s made me learn to sew because I have to take care of these clothes – they have survived 80 years and they can’t die in my care.My style is rooted in the 1930s. I always wear trousers with braces, made from a natural material such as cotton or linen, a collarless shirt, a bakerboy cap and leather shoes. I started off doing it because I’m a carpenter and I got a back injury about eight years ago, so there was a practical side to wearing high-waisted trousers with braces that took the pressure off my back and I really liked pairing them with the 30s style.The way I dress led me into 30s culture. I started playing jazz saxophone and got into the dancing of the period, where the clothes really take on a new purpose. It’s nice for iniduals to express themselves in life. I’m not trying to be anything I’m not, I just feel good dressing like this, and it gives other people a sense of who I am. It’s all positive.I’ve always been interested in clothes even when I was at school I had my own sewing machine and I would adapt clothes or paint them. People would give me a hard time because I was an eccentric, but I was determined to be the way I was and now, as an adult, it doesn’t bother me. People don’t have anything to say.Dressing this way is the future – buying fewer clothes and adapting them. We need to value craft and pay someone for doing their job.I dress in 17th-century clothes from the civil war period. I reenact the war and I like the clothes, so I wear them every day. A typical outfit would be a shirt, breeches, doublet, shoes and a hat. I make a lot of my clothes myself and some I buy from traders at re-enactment events. I read books on the patterns of the period and the methods of manufacture and do what I can.Towards the end of the 90s, I was working at a historical property in Wolverhampton and a mate of mine joined a civil war re-enactment society. He persuaded me to come along. Initially, I would only wear the clothes at the re-enactments, but then they started to seep into my everyday wardrobe and, since 2005, I’ve been wearing them all the time. They’re comfortable and I like the style, so I wear it. It means I don’t have to worry about today’s trends. They do for me what any clothes do: provide warmth and avoid nakedness.I’m self-employed as a guide to a National Trust property, which is in a 1930s modernist style, and some people can be a little thrown to have me there in 17th-century clothing to show them around. But most seem not to bother.I don’t tend to get much backlash some people might shout on the street that I look like Robin Hood, but they need to learn their history Robin Hood was dead by 1200 and these clothes were current by 1640. Generally, people just say it looks like fun.I wear clothes from the 1940s and 50s a typical outfit would be a pair of 30s-style culottes with a little blouse, a 40s sweater and wide-legged pants, or a 50s Gypsy skirt. I’ve been into it since I was 14 years old: that was in the 80s when there were a lot of subcultures happening, from mods to punks. I used to look at the mod girls at school and thought they were fantastic – I wanted to be part of the crew. I started out with 60s clothes and moved back to the 50s as a young adult and have settled on it ever since.I just think it’s so much more glamorous and classy – it makes me feel more special when I wear it, because modern clothing can look so tacky and bland. The clothing I wear is much more colourful and vibrant and I’ve always lived with furniture and decorations from that period, too – it’s become my whole lifestyle. We’ve redecorated our house to replicate the 50s style. I couldn’t live in a grey, modern design, I’d be so depressed. Living in the midst of all this colourful mid-20th-century design gives me so much pleasure. This is what I live in and what I wear because it makes me feel good. People say it makes me look younger, too!I collect clothes from the 1930s to the 50s. An everyday outfit would probably be a vintage picture- or border-print skirt with a Gypsy top and Bakelite jewellery.My dad’s an actor and he was really into old movies, so when I was young, we would watch all the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals together on a Sunday. I always wanted to be Ginger Rogers and I always wanted to dance. When I was in my 20s, I discovered a place in central London where you can go lindy hop or jive dancing and, through going there, I met people who dressed this way and knew the places to get the original clothes. I could finally be Ginger Rogers.That was in about 1996 and I’ve been dressing this way ever since. I wish I’d known it existed before that because I definitely would have started earlier.I love this era of clothes – it’s colourful and you feel so good when you dance in it, especially with men in wide-legged trousers. It’s a far more glamorous era than the one we live in now things can feel so scruffy with just T-shirts and jeans around. Wearing those clothes makes me feel as if I’m inhabiting a different time and they’re such exciting, unique pieces to own.It is important to buy clothes that suit you and your shape, which also bring something distinctive to your day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9191a2eb05f1c2e4ab5cb21924ca5da050d69abf/185_5_1992_1195/master/1992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a10e31d1876a273f2cb06a42641f464c","title":"hollywood film franchise fatigue drives down global ticket sales","story":"Cinemagoers spent almost $19bn in first six months of the year, down from $20.2bn in 2018Film fans spent almost $19bn (£15bn) on going to the cinema in the first six months of the year, compared with the $20.2bn spent in the same period last year.Analysts suggest film fans have grown tired of the number of franchise releases over the period: Men in Black: International Godzilla: King of the Monsters How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part were all released in the first half and failed to live up to expectations.The cinema industry is struggling to keep pace with a record-setting 2018, which smashed box office records globally, thanks in large part to the pre-summer season release of Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War.“It is also worth remembering that 2018 had a very strong start, with films released late the previous year, such as The Greatest Showman and Star Wars: The Last Jedi, still doing good business,” said Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association. “This year hasn’t had that same boost and it is fair to say that the box office take in the first quarter in particular wasn’t as strong as we would have liked.”The cinema industry is also fighting increasing competition from the big streaming companies – with Netflix and Amazon soon to be joined in the sector by Disney and Apple – as well as the huge investment from traditional TV companies such as HBO in mega-hits such as Game of Thrones and Big Little Lies.Last year Netflix made the same number of films as the big Hollywood studios combined – about 80 – and finally became a force at the Oscars this year with Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma winning big. Upcoming releases include the $150m action film 6 Underground, starring Ryan Reynolds.But Clapp says that there have been positive signs of a recovery in theatres with the launch of Avengers: Endgame – the second highest-grossing film of all-time behind James Cameron’s Avatar – at the end of April fuelling the most successful May for UK cinemas in 50 years. More than 16 million film fans flocked to cinemas during the month.Analysts at Wedbush said the idea that US box office figures for the second quarter were disappointing because they missed estimates was “silly”.Michael Pachter of Wedbush said: “It should end up as the second-highest in Q2 history. Investors seem overly focused on a handful of disappointing titles as an indication that people are losing interest in the theatrical experience.”“With a strong second half to the year – The Lion King, Joker, Frozen 2, Downton Abbey, Jumanji: The Next Level, Hobbs \u0026amp Shaw, It Chapter Two, Cats and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker – there’s every chance we will match if not overtake the record-breaking numbers of 2018,” Clapp says.Top five films in the US so far this yearTop five films in the UK so far this year*Still in cinemas"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05d18e0604a5ed524c638934437936dd929de6e/0_1071_4704_2820/master/4704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b22308c994c6cf84589925e65b821c6","title":"cocktail of the week henry c milanese spritz recipe","story":"A summer aperitif of the negroni school, perked up with sparkling white wineA light, sharp and refreshing spritz with bitter citrus undertones – just the thing for a gathering on a warm summer’s evening.15ml Campari15ml dry white vermouth – we use Dolin Dry15ml gin – we use Portobello Road20ml fresh lemon juice20ml basic sugar syrup (equal parts water and sugar)Sparkling wine, to top – we use cava, because it’s a little drierPut the Campari, vermouth, gin, lemon juice and syrup into a large wine glass.

It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

Even if their reign ends, they should be praisedIt would be difficult to script a more idyllic beginning.On a balmy August afternoon in 1985, the US women’s national team warmed up for their first ever game on a pristine pitch in Jesolo, a stunning resort town on the Adriatic coast of Italy. The sky was cloudless, the stands were filled and, to make the visitors feel welcome, Bruce Springsteen boomed over the PA system.In that moment, it hit USA goalkeeper Kim Wyant that she might be a part of history in the making. She looked around the stadium and thought, “This is phenomenal. This is the first game that the US women are ever going to play, and I’m on the field and I get to play in it.”But she never could have imagined how far history would take the US women’s national team, to their fourth World Cup final, their third in a row, which will kick off in Lyon on Sunday night in front of tens of thousands of spectators, the climax of a competition that has smashed records and garnered a global audience of over a billion viewers across all platforms. The USA is the team to beat, an unparalleled, world-dominating squad of bold, eloquent, fierce, headline-grabbing athletes, a juggernaut barreling aside its competition with ruthless aplomb.It would be a while before the players learned how to ask for more.Women’s football in the USA grew out of the college system, the product of Title IX legislation enacted in 1972 to prohibit sex discrimination in education. After the national team formed, competitive games were hard to come by. In 1987, it appears they only played once. Around the same time, a group of players was pushing Fifa to give the women their own World Cup. Michelle Akers, the USA’s legendary centre-forward of the 1990s, travelled to Switzerland to sit in boardrooms with leading figures from the men’s game such as Pele and Franz Beckenbauer. Akers, a free-scoring powerhouse who played at the highest level while managing a chronic health condition, had to sit and listen while the men debated whether women could cope with their own tournament.It was decided they could, as long as the games only lasted 80 minutes, the tournament was played in China, the competition wasn’t televised to the outside world and the official World Cup brand wasn’t tainted by association.It was Akers and the USA team who won the snappily titled Fifa World Championship for Women’s Football for the M\u0026ampM’s Cup in 1991, which was retroactively named the first Fifa Women’s World Cup. They defeated arch-rivals Norway 2-1 in front of 63,000 spectators in Guangzhou, and the players wept and cheered as they held the trophy aloft and flew back home to total anonymity.The team kept playing hard and overcoming disappointments like defeat in the semi-finals of the 1995 World Cup to eventual winners Norway. At the 1996 Olympics, goals from Mia Ham and Tiffeny Milbrett secured the US the first gold medals for women’s football against a technical and tenacious China team.Some teams might have sat back and reveled in their success, but not this one. For the next three years they prepared for the 1999 World Cup, which the USA was hosting, by going on the road to drum up support, meeting fans, hosting open training sessions and attracting publicity for the women’s game. Their relentless drive paid off, culminating in a penalty shootout win over China in front of a crowd of 90,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The famous image of Brandi Chastain’s shirt-waving celebration brought women’s football to the attention of the world.But that USA team, dubbed the ‘99ers, kept striving. They leveraged their fame into setting up the first-ever professional women’s football league in the world, the WUSA. The best players in the world, such as China’s Sun Wen and England’s Kelly Smith, came to play. When the league was about to fold a few years later, it was the ‘99ers who took a pay cut to try and keep it alive. The US women’s players, with their endeavor and generosity, pretty much single-handedly carved out the professional game from nothing.The success of the current league, the seven-year-old NWSL, is still intertwined with the success of the US women’s team every member of the current squad plays in the league. It has survived on their victories, a total of four Olympic gold medal wins and three World Cups to date, including the most recent, in 2015.Yet if this World Cup has showed anything, it’s that Europe is catching up, as traditional powers in the men’s game put their weight behind their women’s teams. The Netherlands have made it to their first World Cup final on the strength of performances from Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema and Barcelona’s Lieke Martens.“I think this could be a tipping point, unfortunately,” says Wyant. “For the US, it should motivate us to think about our women’s professional league, about how we’re going to keep these women playing after college in a very competitive environment. Because when I think about teams in England and Spain, they can invest in these players from a very young age and it could make a big difference moving forward as to how it shakes up the world power structure.”Much has been made of the US team’s attitude throughout this World Cup: the so-called arrogance, the pointed celebrations. But to label this team, or any women’s team, as arrogant is to misunderstand women’s sports entirely and the daily struggle for recognition and recompense. Still paid according to an archaic Fifa bonus structure that seriously undervalues the women’s game, the US women’s team is engaged in a federal lawsuit with US Soccer to demand equal pay with their counterparts on the men’s team.These are players who believe that women’s rights are human rights and that equality is achievable and worth fighting for. This is a team for our time. So, if the sovereigns of women’s soccer are to be deposed in years to come, may their reign end in scenes of triumph."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

Well, semi-official: last month, in Geneva, the World Health Organisation announced it was recognising burnout for the first time – yet the next day, it emerged this wasn’t the case. (Let’s be fair to the WHO staff, though they’re probably just very tired.) In a widely shared essay, the Buzzfeed writer Anne Helen Petersen described her own burnout, and the associated “task paralysis”, leaving her unable to complete basic chores. This kind of burnout isn’t a temporary crisis, she argued for millennials, “It’s our base temperature.” And it won’t be solved by self-help: “You don’t fix it with a vacation, or an adult colouring book, or ‘anxiety baking’ – which helps explain why so many millennials increasingly identify with democratic socialism and are embracing unions: we are beginning to understand what ails us, and it’s not something an oxygen facial or a treadmill desk can fix.”I agree, and thus hesitate to mention a self-help technique here. But while we try to overhaul society, we still have to tackle our to-do lists, and there’s one technique I’ve recently found more useful than any other, as well as better suited to this era of exhaustion and overwhelm: limiting work-in-progress, or WIP. It’s a simple notion, originating in the Japanese system of industrial scheduling known as “kanban”, adapted by Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry in their book Personal Kanban. You fix a small upper limit to the number of tasks you’ll be working on at any one time – say, three. Then, you add no further tasks to your plate until you’ve finished at least one. When there are only two tasks remaining in your WIP, you can bring in one more. And so on. The kanban system visualises this using Post-its on a whiteboard, arranged in columns: each task moves from the “to do” column to “doing” to “done”. If your WIP limit is three, there should never be more than three notes in “doing”. (You can add a “waiting” column, where you shunt tasks that are waiting on other people.)The effects are extraordinary. By limiting WIP, you feel your finite capacity, so the counterproductive urge to start 15 tasks naturally subsides. Without trying, you find yourself breaking projects down into doable chunks (because if “write book” or “get new job” is one of your tasks, it’ll jam things up for months). Above all, this way of working brings a deeply satisfying sense of having a foothold on things. Benson and Barry write: “Linearly finishing one task before embarking on the next commitment becomes addictive, a pattern, and eventually a habit.”The obvious objection is that you have too many demands on your time to limit WIP to three. But that’s a misunderstanding. You already can’t do more than a handful of things at once. If the world demands you do a hundred, that’s an impossible request. Your only options are to choose, consciously, which ones will have to wait – or choose unconsciously. And to be clear, none of this is a magic solution to burnout. Instead, it’s a repudiation of magic solutions, a liberatingly down-to-earth engagement with how things actually are.Jim Benson outlines the basics of dealing with overload – you’ll need a lot of sticky notes, and a spare wall – in a video series at personalkanban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c89d053e18c8e57b0070745e541ae1b96ea9c6/581_1016_5529_3317/master/5529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a57a27237583e2e27555e0aa74d6c38b","title":"i went jogging and lost my leg experience","story":"My surgeon thought someone had made a mistake – he didn’t believe that injuries that bad could have been caused by a tripI’ve always been accident-prone – spilling coffee down white blouses or smashing glasses all the time. But what happened on that May morning in 2016 went far beyond my usual clumsiness. It was a devastating accident that, at 25 years old, would change my life for ever.That day, my sister Althea and I had decided to go jogging along the canal near the flat we shared in London. Five minutes from home, I tripped over my own feet. I fell on the gravel path, a searing pain ripping through my right leg. I’d twisted it and the knee had dislocated, my foot bent at an alarming angle. I assumed it was a fracture. I couldn’t move, but felt strangely calm, the adrenaline acting as a painkiller.Neither of us had brought our phones, so we had to wait for a passerby to call an ambulance it felt like hours. By now, I was fighting unconsciousness and in agony. A man came along and made the call, then disappeared, telling us he had a train to catch. All we could do was wait. I heard a siren draw nearer before fading away. Eventually, a girl appeared. She phoned another ambulance and waited with us, flagging it down from the road. I remember laughing with the paramedics, feeling positive, despite being on the maximum dose of morphine. They showed no sign of panic I thought I’d be home that night.But within a few hours, I was in intensive care. There was no pulse in my right foot. The severity of my injuries stunned everyone. My surgeon has since told me that when he was bleeped from A\u0026ampE that morning, he thought someone had made a mistake – he didn’t believe that injuries that bad could have been caused by a trip. After I fell, the blood couldn’t get through to my foot, leading to an excruciating condition called compartment syndrome, where a blockage to the arteries stops the circulation. After three lengthy operations to try to restart the blood flow, I was at risk of developing sepsis.When I was told I’d lose my leg, all I felt was fear. I remember the surgeons discussing whether to amputate above or below my knee, and watching as though it were happening to someone else. When they asked me what I thought, I blinked back tears. “Please,” I pleaded, “I’m 25. Just save as much of my leg as you can.” I took a final look at my right foot the toenails painted red, skin mottled blue. By that point, I was in so much pain I just wanted it to stop.After six weeks in hospital, I moved back to my parents’ house in Kent. I spent four months in a wheelchair, waiting for my knee to heal before I could get a prosthetic leg. My psychological state deteriorated. I hated how others saw me, those pitying smiles to the girl in the wheelchair.In October 2016, I was admitted to a specialist amputee rehabilitation centre, where I embarked on a programme of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and counselling. Getting my first prosthetic leg was the turning point. It was heavy and cumbersome, and I was terrified to begin with. But when I watch the video of my first shaky steps, the light in my eyes is unmistakable. There was something about the physicality of standing tall, of literally putting one foot in front of the other, that shifted my mindset.Three months later, I moved back to London, gradually regained my independence and began a phased return to work as a journalist. Life had changed – but perhaps not as drastically as I’d feared. Getting around uses a huge amount of energy, and while I still have a busy social life, I’ve learned to listen to my body to slow down when I need to.There are days when grief weighs heavy, but the positives mostly outweigh the negatives. I’ve tried things I never thought I would: wild swimming, climbing the O2 arena and running on a blade, similar to those used by Paralympians. I’ve bought a flat, found a boyfriend, and this month publish my first novel, Five Steps To Happy, about an amputee’s journey to recovery.Every year, on the anniversary of the accident, I walk along the canal. I run there sometimes, too, but it feels especially poignant to stand in the spot where everything changed, and remind myself how lucky I am. My own path may have shifted direction, but the horizon is bright. Blade bouncing, heart pumping, I’ve never felt more alive.• Do you have an experience to share?

In fact, “we speak with an accent that’s exceedingly rare!” At least that’s what the Coventry City fans sing every week, whether it’s at the Ricoh Arena or at away games up and down the country – or that season we played our home games in Northampton, but we don’t talk about that.Luckily, due to our location on one of the country’s most central rail lines, it’s incredibly easy for us to get to just about anywhere in the UK, whether it be for football, shopping, boozing, sightseeing, or … what else is there?And if you’re coming to us by rail (TIP: London Northwestern Railway has FREE wifi in every carriage), there are some unspoken things you should know about us lot, located smack bang in the middle of England.No, Coventry is not basically BirminghamThis assertion is lazy geography. We are 20 miles away from Birmingham. Sunderland is barely 15 miles away from Newcastle upon Tyne but you wouldn’t say “Newcastle is basically in Sunderland”, unless you wanted to get banished from the north-east forever. Solihull is a town that is “basically” Birmingham. We are our own city, with enough cathedrals to spare (more on that in a minute).Coventry – and its spirit – is indestructibleDue to our extremely central location – Meriden, the traditional centre of England is just 8 miles away – we’ve often found ourselves in the middle of some heated situations. The most notable of which was the Coventry blitz, which took place on the night of the 14 November 1940. It was the single most concentrated attack on a British city during the second world war. It lasted for 11 hours as the Luftwaffe essentially attempted to knock Coventry off the map, being one of the UK’s major centres for war production. The old cathedral was mostly destroyed during that raid, but its remains now serve as a phenomenal event space.We also have a rich history of cathedralsWhile the old cathedral was destroyed, as mentioned, we had an old, old cathedral that Henry VIII ordered to be destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century. What remains of it is still standing and open to the public in the Priory undercrofts, which was dug up by Tony Robinson for a Time Team special in 1999 on Channel 4. Side note: There is a Nando’s right next to the Priory gardens, so you can make a decent afternoon of history and chicken.Enjoy flying abroad? You have us to thank for thatIf we are honest, we aren’t the greatest at making a big deal about the things we’ve done in the past. For a city that was essentially the beating heart of the country’s motor industry, we should at least talk about it as much as Brummies like to talk about how they are the second city.But more impressive than that is Coventry’s very own Sir Frank Whittle. No, it’s not just the name of a school in Walsgrave – Sir Frank Whittle was the genius behind the modern jet engine, which effectively changed the world.When Sir Frank first brought forward his plans to the UK’s Air Ministry in 1929, his blueprints were called “impractical”. Just eight years later, in 1937, his Whittle Unit engine roared into life, and by 1941 jet-powered planes were heading to war. The rest, as they say, is history.If you call it the Phoenix or the Kasbah, we know you are a studentClubs change names, that’s true, but we never forget – or stop calling them by – their older names.That club on Primrose Hill Street in Hillfields is The Colly (or Colosseum for the more formal among you) not the Kasbah, despite what it says above the doors. Those who really know their history will recall a brief period in the early 90s when it was called the Tic Toc, and played host to Blur and Ocean Colour Scene amid Britpop fever. The Phoenix? That’s the Colin Campbell or the Campbell to those who grew up here. And the building with the domed roof opposite? Before it was a Cov Uni building it was an old Odeon theatre.We still really hate Aston VillaIt’s been nearly 20 years since both clubs were even in the same ision – the 200001 season of the Premier League – but we still despise the Birmingham club, with a passion. Attend any Coventry City game and you’ll hear the fans singing “S**t on the Villa”. It’s not clever, but it is funny. The reason why? That’s open to debate, but what’s football without rivalry?We birthed skaIt’s yer da’s favourite thing to put on the pub jukebox – and for good reason. He was probably there when Coventry musicians the Specials and the Selecter put 2-Tone on the map.The Specials’ 1980 hit Ghost Town is a song that still encapsulates Coventry. At least that’s what the band’s drummer John Bradbury said in 2011: “When I think about Ghost Town I think about Coventry.”It’s a batchIt’s an argument that’s been done to its doughy death on Facebook and Instagram, but when it comes to a bread roll we call it a batch because it IS a batch and this is why: batch originates from the German word meaning “to bake” or “bacan” in old English. Over time this evolved into “process of baking” to “event of baking” to “the set of things baked” and eventually to a “set of things”, ie a batch. And these bread rolls would be baked in batches too. Therefore you have the batch.Book your tickets to Coventry with London Northwestern Railway at londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8595c36b56a0b1ff8c323a6f10ba3c23f122c254/0_355_2854_1712/master/2854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86394f2aa909e0406df084d7d3d21760","title":"kirsty young to step down as host of desert island discs","story":"Broadcaster says taking a break from show, due to fibromyalgia, made her reassess careerKirsty Young is to step down permanently as the host of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, saying it is time to pursue new challenges.The broadcaster made her debut as the presenter of the long-running programme, a staple of BBC radio since 1942, in 2006.Last summer, she announced she would be taking a break from the show, which has been hosted in her absence by Lauren Laverne, for a “number of months” as she was suffering from a form of fibromyalgia.BBC Radio 4 said in a statement Young had decided to step down permanently.Young said: “After 12 incredibly happy and fulfilling years on Desert Island Discs I’ve decided to step down permanently.“Having been forced to take some months away from my favourite job because of health problems, I’m happy to say I’m now well on the way to feeling much better.“But that enforced absence from the show has altered my perspective on what I should do next and so I’ve decided it’s time to pursue new challenges.“Having hundreds of castaways share their triumphs, tragedies, tribulations and tracks with me over the years was a huge privilege and an education. I am so thankful to Roy Plomley for the brilliance of his format, and I wish the programme and Lauren all the very best.”Young has presented 496 episodes of the programme as well as fronting its 70th and 75th anniversary celebrations.Her castaways have included Zadie Smith, David Beckham, Bruce Springsteen, Victoria Wood, Dame Kelly Holmes, Dame Judi Dench, George Michael, Alice Walker, Tom Hanks, the second world war pilot Eric “Winkle” Brown and Sir David Attenborough.Desert Island Discs was first broadcast on 29 January 1942 – was Vic Oliver, a music-hall star from the 1930s was interviewed by presenter Roy Plomley.Comedian Arthur Askey made the first of his record four appearances on 2 April 1942 – the others came in 1955, 1968 and 1980. He shares the record with David Attenborough, who was the the 70th-anniversary guest on 29 January 2012 and had also been on in 1957, 1979 and 1998\u0026nbspRoy Plomley himself was one of the earliest subjects. he was interviewed by the BBC’s head of music Leslie Perowne in May 1942. Plomley made another appearance as castaway in May 1958, interviewed by Eamonn Andrews.The programme was dropped as part of a postwar shakeup at the BBC in 1946, but was revived in 1951 and has been going strong ever since.Asking guests to choose a luxury only began on 16 September 1951, when the actor Sally Ann Howes, during the era of rationing, modestly requested garlic.The tradition of giving castaways a copy of the Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare and asking them to choose another book started a month later.\u0026nbspIn 1964 the herring gulls that accompany the opening music were replaced after listeners pointed out they were indigenous to the northern hemisphere and would not have been found on the shores of a tropical island. The sounds of tropical birds were substituted, but even more listeners complained, so after a couple of months the geographically inappropriate gulls returned.Plomley’s final castaway was the actor Sheila Steafel. The programme was broadcast on 11 May 1985. The interviewer died of pleurisy 17 days later. He had presented 1,791 editions of the programme over a 43-year period.Plomley was succeeded by Michael Parkinson. He planned to ask more searching questions and to listen to the music with the castaway in real time.\u0026nbsp Parkinson’s first castaway, on 5 January 1986, was film director Alan Parker. He did the show for a little over two years.Parkinson’s successor was Sue Lawley, who came aboard in the spring of 1988. She had herself been a castaway in November 1987. Her luxury item was an ironing board. Her first guest, on 27 March 1988, was Lord Hailsham. She was to do the job for 18 years.The 50th anniversary guest on 26 January 1992 was the then prime minister, John Major. He chose a full-scale model of the Oval cricket ground as his luxury item.Lawley’s final interview was with actor Joan Plowright on 27 August 2006.\u0026nbsp She was replaced by Kirsty Young, who opened on 1 October 2006 with illustrator Quentin Blake as her first guest.Mick Jagger is one of the famous Desert Island Discs refuseniks – George Bernard Shaw, Laurence Olivier, Ted Hughes and Prince Charles turned it down too.\u0026nbspThe BBC’s director of radio and education, James Purnell, said: “Kirsty has been a wonderful host of Desert Island Discs for more than a decade and her intuitive interviewing style as well as her warmth and humour has helped bring out incredible life stories and anecdotes from her castaways. We know how loved she is by listeners and we all wish her well for the future.“Lauren Laverne has been doing a brilliant job at the helm in Kirsty’s absence and I’m delighted she continues to host one of Radio 4’s most popular shows.”Laverne will continue to host Desert Island Discs for the foreseeable future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/552c5fcf186be7a30f474985a67f99f71c022609/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83d192e08d9a3455fe0b021fb1634a2f","title":"life goals how three women made their money work","story":" Sacrifice isn’t easy, whether it’s postponing a holiday or giving up takeaways. Putting that extra money into an ISA or an investment portfolio, however, could make a real differencePutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Most investments should be considered as a medium- to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

The tax does not cover sugary milk-based drinks but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested this could happen as a way of tackling childhood obesity.Johnson’s campaign is being directed by Mark Fullbrook, who co-runs the London company in Crosby’s empire, Crosby Textor Fullbrook Partners (CTFP).The company does not say which firms it represents in the UK.A register of lobbying interests in New South Wales shows the Australian part of Crosby’s business, Crosby Textor Research Strategies Results, acts for the dairy multinational Parmalat.The Italian-based company, owned by the French dairy group Lactalis, sells various brands of sugared milk-based drinks in Australia, some with higher sugar content than soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, which would subject them to an extended UK-style sugar tax.Fullbrook worked with Johnson on his successful 2012 campaign to win a second term as London mayor. He was also behind Zac Goldmith’s losing mayoral campaign four years later, which was condemned by critics as racist for focusing extensively on the Muslim background of the eventual winner, Labour’s Sadiq Khan.The Crosby Textor group said Fullbrook had taken holiday to work with Johnson, and had no contact with any of the company’s clients. But Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said he was concerned about the situation.“There is a clear responsibility on MPs to avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest,” he said. “It appears Johnson has no regard for this principle and the ministerial code would be worthless were he the person responsible for enforcing it, as the prime minister is supposed to do.“Crosby must immediately register his firm with the lobbying register and provide a full list of the clients he represents. Johnson must also come clean as to what role Crosby had in formulating his sugar tax proposals. Both have serious questions to answer.”A spokesman for CT Group, the parent organisation that includes the British and Australian firms, said: “As has been reported extensively, Mark Fullbrook has taken holiday to volunteer for Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign and has no contact with any clients. To suggest or imply that CT Group has anything to do with the campaign’s policy announcements is completely and utterly wrong and deliberately misleading.”There was no comment from Johnson’s campaign team.In January it emerged that Johnson received £23,000 in loans and donations from CTF Partners to help pay for office and staffing costs.Crosby and his firms have been heavily involved in several Conservative election campaigns, a number of them successful. Crosby was knighted after he helped David Cameron win a majority in the 2015 election.However, he also oversaw the disastrous 2017 Tory election campaign that cost Theresa May her majority, in which the Conservatives spent £4m with CTFP. subsequently revealed that Crosby’s UK company oversaw a network of secretive pro-Brexit Facebook campaigns, part of a wider effort to undermine May and push Britain towards a hard Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

Make no mistake about it, the eight-time Super League champions are by no means safe from relegation just yet but both the performances and results they have conjured up in the last six days finally offer some hope that there are less traumatic times ahead.Super League games as high-octane as these are often decided by moments of brilliance in attack but here the foundations for a second successive Leeds victory were laid firmly in defence. For over an hour they kept Castleford scoreless and, while the hosts’ profligacy certainly played a part, the desire and determination the Rhinos showed without the ball was decisive in helping them move two points clear of London and Hull KR at the bottom. For the first time in a while there is daylight between Leeds and the relegation zone.Having spent what seemed like the entire first half defending their own line, the fact that Leeds led 6-0 at half-time thanks to a well-worked try for their captain, Trent Merrin – who led from the front with an assured display – was the kind of psychological blow the Rhinos have rarely been able to dish out in what has been a dismal season.Of course, this would not be a Leeds victory from the class of 2019 without a near-collapse and after back-to-back tries from James Clare breached their line to make it 14-10 in the blink of an eye Rhinos supporters would have been fearful of throwing away two vital points in the fight against relegation. But with seven minutes remaining their fears were calmed when the new signing Rob Lui weaved his way through to re-establish their two-score lead.Prior to those tries from Clare, Leeds put themselves in a position of control when Jack Walker’s try doubled their lead, before a penalty from Liam Sutcliffe made it 14-0. Castleford, who could fall out of the play-off places later this weekend deserve a slither of credit for creating a climactic finish but in truth this was a night which belonged entirely to Leeds. There have not been too many occasions this season when their supporters have been able to celebrate that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bfcd7964e4635aeeda4758e3d633403c1a097e/0_88_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf810eef721da593765b38595239470","title":"cori gauff polona hercog","story":"Wimbledon has found itself a new star. Coco Gauff had already shown everyone she could play dazzling tennis, her victory over the five-times champion, Venus Williams, in the opening round signalling her arrival on the world stage.But last night, the 15-year-old, already the youngest player to ever qualify for the main draw, showed the kind of grit and fight that champions are made of as she came from a set and 5-2 down and saved two match points to beat Polona Hercog of Slovenia 3-6, 7-6, 7-5 for a place in the fourth round.As Hercog’s final attempted lob sailed long, Gauff leapt up and down several times, arms above her head while her parents, Corey and Candi, went crazy in the stands, the Centre Court crowd joining them in their elation. This was a stunning comeback, the kind of thing most 15-year-olds would not be capable of, especially on the biggest stage of all but Gauff is no ordinary teenager.How a player deals with adversity is every bit as much an indication of greatness as blistering serves and wickedly-spun backhands. And when her back was to the wall deep in the second set on Centre Court, the teenager showed the kind of resolve that bodes well for the future, both this week and beyond. In her first grand slam event, having won three qualifying matches to even get to the main draw, she is now one of the last 16 standing.“Right now I’m just relieved that it’s over,” said Gauff, who now plays the former world No 1 Simona Halep in the fourth round on Monday. “She was playing unbelievable. I always knew that I could come back, whatever the score is. I just really went for my shots and I’m just happy that slice down the line went in.”The slice down the line was a backhand, inside-out slice which found the sideline when Hercog, who had played flawlessly until that point, had her first match point on the American’s serve, at 5-2 in the second set. Hercog challenged it but Hawk-Eye backed up the line call and Gauff went on to hold for 5-3.Serving for the match, the Slovenian world No 60 hit a big ace to set up a second match point but it was then that the nerves really began to set in and she double-faulted to miss the opportunity. Gauff broke and held to level at 5-5, but it looked like Hercog had regained her poise when she served her way to a 6-5 lead.But a horrible smash on the opening point of the Gauff service game, a bounce smash from close to the net that somehow she put out, showed all too clearly the tightness she was feeling and Gauff forced a tie-break. Still Hercog had a chance, leading 5-3 but Gauff rallied to take it 9-7, fist pumping and chest-banging in celebration.What a crazy match. In the first set, Hercog had been utterly dominant. It took Gauff until the second set before she won a single point on her opponent’s first serve while her thunderous forehand was doing the damage and though she missed a break point chance in the third game, she slapped another forehand to break for 4-3 and took the set soon after.Hercog cut loose at the start of the second set and led 3-0, extending her lead to 5-2 only to tighten up, as the crowd got behind Gauff even more. Usually, it is the youngster who feels the pressure here it was the 28-year-old, her record of never having been past the third round of a grand slam suddenly making sense.Having forced the decider, Gauff was made to wait as Hercog took a bathroom break, starting to feel the effects of the long rallies that had become the feature of the match, the pair going slice to slice, Hercog terrified to go for it in case she made a mistake. Gauff was the aggressor and as she began the third set in style, racing to a 4-1 lead.Hercog had a leg rub-down at 4-1, with ice on both legs, and a good hold of serve gave her hope. Suddenly it was Gauff who was missing, and the pair were level at 4-4. But Gauff simply refused to give in, and she hit two aces to move ahead again at 5-4.After Hercog held for 5-5, Gauff reasserted her authority with a love hold of serve and the next game turned into a dogfight.Hercog began with a double-fault but led 30-15 only for Gauff to win the next point with a second smash after the first one had been lobbed back into play. At deuce, the more experienced Hercog missed a forehand to give Gauff match point and unlike her opponent, the 15-year-old took her chance, scrambling back a short ball and then watching as the lob went over her head and long.As Gauff celebrated, the crowd, who had helped lift her when she was down, joined her. “They say No 1 Court was my court,” she said, having beaten Venus Williams and Magdalena Rybarikova there to make the third round. “Maybe Centre could be my court as well. The crowd was amazing, even when I was down match point. I’m just super thankful that they believe in me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb70ccb705ca7eb0568d95a1c605523a21534a5f/0_0_2633_1580/master/2633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52eb71eb662c4f438c8a534bc171e5d7","title":"engalnd world cup action plan two games from history","story":"One of the bigger cheers of the 2005 Ashes came when Michael Vaughan won the toss before the final Test at the Oval. If there are any England fans at Edgbaston for Thursday’s semi-final, there will surely be a similar cheer should Eoin Morgan do the same. As in 2005, batting first has suddenly assumed critical importance. A combination of tired pitches and debilitating pressure mean the team batting first have won 26 of the 39 completed games at this tournament – including 15 of the last 18. That’s the kind of data nobody can ignore.While England have been criticised for not always adapting with the bat, no one can doubt their tactical flexibility. Two of the non-negotiables of their World Cup plan – bowling first and playing two spinners – have gone out the window because of changes in conditions and form. And though they will remain open minded in case they encounter extreme conditions, it is hard to see them deviating from the new balance of five fast bowlers and one spinner – especially as all the fast bowlers are in form and both the spinners are not.Don Bradman was once told by Neville Cardus that the law of averages was against him making runs the following day. “I don’t believe in the law of averages,” Bradman said. He scored 304. England will hope Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow have a similar attitude, because they are due a failure. Their opening partnership has become totemic both in style and substance, and their record at home is almost Bradman-esque: they have an average stand of 95 and have hit nine 100 partnerships in 16 innings. And England have won all nine games when they have put on 100. The new-ball partnership of Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer has been almost as important. England are superb frontrunners with bat and ball and excellent at holding their nerve in the field during a tight run chase but they are not as good at dragging a game back after a poor start. It’s no coincidence that the two big opening partnerships against them in this tournament – by Pakistan and Australia – led not only to defeat but also a slightly alarming unravelling in the field. All three potential opponents in the knockout stages rely heavily on their top four, so a strong start – and ideally a couple of early wickets – would be ideal. But England cannot expect to always control games from the start. At some stage, whether with bat or ball, they will have to cope with mid-match adversity better than they have so far in the tournament. A World Cup doesn’t come for free.Fielding is a window into a team’s soul. England lost their way and their rag against Pakistan and Australia, and both times it affected their batting later in the day. Their fielding in the two must-win matches against India and New Zealand was electric, symbolised by Bairstow’s almost-demented boundary-riding. They need to reach the same standard in the knockout stages, especially if they are asked to field first.The remaining semi-finalists are superb sides, yet all have passengers. England’s ability to target the weaker links, with ball and especially bat, will be critical. Their assault on India’s Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav last Sunday was breathtaking in its audacity, courage and skill, and for most of the tournament they have marmalised even the best spinners. Spin was England’s white-ball kryptonite for so long if they are going to win the World Cup they may as well exorcise one of the biggest demons of the last 27 years.Fifty overs is a long time. In the last two matches England have had very quiet spells with the bat, yet still scored over 300 both times. There will be periods in the semi-final when the scoreboard gets stuck England need to accept that and sit in for a few overs where necessary. They will also, surely, accept that Jasprit Bumrah and especially Mitchell Starc must be handled with the utmost care.There is no need for anyone to shove a game plan under the wrong hotel door. Everyone knows Morgan will be peppered with short balls when he comes to the crease. In the next few days he should spend hours having balls thrown at his head in the nets. Most of all, whether it is to duck, hook, make room or phone a friend, he needs to have absolute clarity in his mind. In the biggest matches the performance of the captain can set a decisive tone.Roy could have been out first ball against New Zealand. Bairstow twice put an inside-edge against Mohammad Shami past leg stump at the start of his century against India. Mark Wood’s fingertip dismissed Kane Williamson in the kind of freak incident that makes people believe in destiny. As good as England were against India and New Zealand they had the kind of luck that is usually essential in knockout games. They won both tosses, too, and were able to pick their best XI despite a few niggles to their fast bowlers. The backup looks relatively weak, for various reasons, so England will be desperate to avoid untimely injuries.Adil Rashid played an important role in England’s win over New Zealand on Wednesday but only with the bat and in the field. His bowling has been out of sorts all summer, not just in this World Cup, and he has gone from key player to afterthought. The leg spinner has the worst economy rate and strike rate of any England bowler in the tournament. A shoulder problem has affected his ability to bowl the googly. Rashid has had a number of injections in his shoulder and may have another before Thursday’s semi-final. He could also do with an injection of confidence from Morgan, who has managed him so brilliantly for four years. If Rashid – and also Jos Buttler – hit form, England will be in serious danger of winning a World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d87bd6e0dddfea8ebd2465e26a70b9d80ebb8fe/0_124_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bc72eaaeb3e963504b43befe7a89fe0","title":"john mcririck big mac","story":"When he was not hamming it up for the television, Big Mac’s manner could be a lot milder, even courteous and kindThe trick of being John McCririck, or one of them, lay in his ability to make people smile while putting their backs up. He was outrageous, in both speech and appearance, because what he wanted most of all was a reaction and so he enlivened many a broadcast or social occasion that might otherwise have fallen rather flat.“I’m afraid we can be rather a bland lot,” reflected one horse racing insideron Friday, on being informed that “Big Mac” had died at the age of 79. McCririck’s career could be described as a reckless, headlong flight from anything remotely bland, and the standard reaction for any viewer, flicking channels and stumbling across him for the first time, must surely have been: “What on Earth is going on here?”Shaggily side-burned, he seemed to have assembled his entire wardrobe from what he found backstage during a pantomime. His endless array of hats included a fez, a boater, a Sherlock Holmes deerstalker and a pith helmet, which he accessorised with a fly-swatter.He was a magnet for casual racegoers, thrilled to be near perhaps the only person on the racecourse their friends would have heard of. At the first hint of someone mugging at the camera behind him, McCririck would seem outraged. “Behave yourselves!” he would bellow and perhaps walk away, shaking his head as if it was impossible to continue in these circumstances.Such a man was not asking to be taken seriously, and so McCririck got away with saying things that might have been enormously damaging to someone else’s career, notably almost anything he said on the subject of women. “There is no slander in an allowed fool,” as Olivia might have said, had they met.While McCririck thrived on the attention his persona brought him, the buffoon act sold him short. He was a skilled journalist whose investigations uncovered a couple of betting-related scandals in the 70s. The producers of Channel 4 Racing almost invariably turned to McCririck when there was a serious interview to be done.He prepared for hours before any broadcast, drew on notes he had compiled about key races over decades and could be relied upon to have read all the relevant news coverage before going on air, not so common a habit as might be expected.When he wasn’t hamming it up for the telly, McCririck’s manner could be a lot milder, even courteous and kind, though there was nothing contrived about the right-wing politics he expressed and held to in private. He formed what must have seemed to many an unlikely friendship with my father, Robin Cook, when they bumped into each other waiting for a train after the races at Doncaster.They were good company for each other. I think Dad enjoyed hearing tales about racing folk that could never be printed and in return shared similarly unverifiable insights into the world of politics. When Dad died, it seemed natural to ask McCririck to be among the speakers at his funeral. I’m afraid he was more outspoken that day than I could have wished, but on reflection this shows only naivety on my part. No one else was surprised.If I expected any kind of favourable treatment from him, I was soundly disabused some years later when appearing for the first time on ATR’s Sunday Forum, a debate show about horse racing. Waiting nervously for the ‘off’, I mentioned to McCririck some view I was planning to express. “That’s great!” he replied, with every sign of affable collegiality. “You say that, and I’ll destroy you.”It was not hostility and the gratitude was real. What McCririck valued on air was difference, dissent, raised voices and finger-jabbing. It generated more heat than light but he reckoned it made for good viewing and his longevity in television suggests he was on to something.One Thursday evening, Dad was surprised to find McCririck on his patch as a guest on Question Time. How did it go, I asked. “Typical John,” he replied, “spraying benzene and throwing matches.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35ae3c8ce126b61d1c170c0a1f3fe8a9b44f8363/0_92_2752_1652/master/2752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60345b7f08c660eec12825c8e6bb9868","title":"pakistan bangladesh cricket world cup match report","story":"In the end it came with neither a whimper nor a roar but with a flicked single behind square by Tamim Iqbal off a shortish ball from Mohammad Amir.Batting first, Pakistan had made 315 at Lord’s. At which point the ICC version of Skynet ran the numbers through its circuits and decreed that they needed to bowl Bangladesh out for seven runs or fewer to qualify for the semi-finals of the World Cup.Defending seven to stay in the tournament Pakistan still managed to cram in a misfield and a dropped slip catch before Tamim dealt the death blow in the second over of Bangladesh’s response. And so that was that. Just past the halfway point on a mild, boisterous day at Lord’s the live group stages of this World Cup were in effect over.Pakistan had already survived the opening hazard before the start of play as Sarfaraz Ahmed won the toss and decided to bat. Losing the toss and bowling – or in a moment of glorious self-immolation winning the toss and choosing to bowl – would have put Pakistan out before the game began.Instead they were required to score at least 400 to have any chance of overhauling New Zealand on net run rate. They set their sights on simply winning the game, with a target built around an urgent partnership between Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam and some late hitting from Imad Wasim.Fakhar Zaman departed early. The partnership of 157 between Imam and Babar arrived off 149 balls, set to a relentless buzz around those austere three-quarter full stands - the only exception the pavilion which remained a sea of white.Babar went for a delicately assertive 96. Imam’s hundred came up off 99 balls, at which point he kissed the Lord’s turf before treading on his stumps, his second such dismissal at this tournament. For Bangladesh Mustafizur Rahman sent down his array of wrist-snapping variations to end with five for 75.In reply Tamim was deceived early on by a wonderful cutter from Shaheen Afridi. Shakib Al Hasan continued his high summer form, gliding to 64 before Shaheen picked up the key wicket. Shakib’s lowest score of the World Cup remains his 41 at Edgbaston against Australia. From 154 for five at that stage Bangladesh unravelled steadily towards a 94-run defeat.Beyond that Lord’s was a noisy, fun place throughout the day. The challenge for the home of cricket, and indeed every ground in England, will be to tempt this domestic crowd back in through the doors once the touring teams have gone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e887855d19ff86ce253be6800d9c139b49af25e2/0_38_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978fec567783784de759d225dc29a76d","title":"team ineos dave brailsford uci lappartient feud","story":"Dave Brailsford has ended his feud with David Lappartient, the president of world cycling’s governing body, after the pair met for a conciliatory private dinner in the spring.The first half of last year’s Tour was characterised by a slanging match between the Team Ineos principal and Lappartient after Chris Froome’s salbutamol investigation was dropped by Wada and the UCI.After Lappartient suggested that “Froome had more financial support to find good experts” Brailsford retaliated by accusing the Frenchman of a “cop-out” and of having a “local French mayor kind of mentality”.“I think he is still learning ...,” Brailsford said of Lappartient last July. “The quicker he can get there, and learn what a president of an international federation’s responsibilities are, the better it will be.”Although the pair had not previously met, their reconciliation apparently occurred in April, which was also around the time Team Sky became Team Ineos.“We had dinner, shook hands, cleared the air and moved on,” Brailsford said in Brussels. “It’s important we collaborate for the benefit of the sport and I take my responsibility really seriously about that. If I can help or support David in his role then I’m certainly happy to do that.”On the road there is little doubt Ineos will, despite Chris Froome’s absence through injury, be the team to beat. According to Brailsford, Froome has left hospital and is at home in Monaco beginning his rehab. “He left hospital yesterday and transferred to home,” he said. “That’s a big step. He’s managed to put his feet on the floor for the first time in a long time.”The Tour starts without the four-times winner and the Ineos co-leaders, Geraint Thomas and Egan Bernal put on a united front when they met the media. “It’s about trust and the understanding that nobody is going to do anything unexpected,”Brailsford said of their dual leadership. “Clarity is important. When it does get separated at times, as maybe we have had in the past, it’s difficult for the team to know who to get behind so that discussion and trust is fundamental.“The relationship between these two is very good,” Brailsford said. “They know each other, they’re comfortable together, they communicate together, they’re straight with each other and there’s no bullshit with them.”“Egan’s a nice guy,” Thomas said. “He’s got morals. Colombians are honest and family-oriented and I definitely feel that with Egan. The biggest thing is that he can speak English really well so we can communicate. That’s the biggest hurdle sometimes when it comes to two different nationalities.”On the other side of Brussels the Mitchelton-Scott team of the Yates twins, Adam and Simon, was setting out its stall as potential contenders for final victory in Paris.“Our No 1 priority is to chase the yellow jersey,” the Yates’ team manager, Matt White, said. “It’s one of the most open Tours de France we’ve seen in the last 10 years and our goal is to give Adam the best support.”If a sense of unity is on the march in the Ineos camp and at Mitchelton-Scott, a breakdown of relations within the Dimension Data team over the omission of Mark Cavendish from the Tour appears to be reaching critical mass.In what was an embarrassingly brief and stilted press conference, the team manager, Doug Ryder, opted not to appear and only one rider was willing to comment on Cavendish’s absence.“It is pretty sad for everybody,” the South African rider Reinardt Janse van Rensburg said. “Cav is a legend of the sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01f9dfd703e2db8f0248b35d7843462354d3a9f/0_1117_2917_1749/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5972012bc10bcc1aeb048b2d9548e53a","title":"how eye gaze technology brought creativity back into an artists life","story":"Sarah Ezekiel explains how accessible technology helped her paint and recover after a motor neurone disease diagnosis Sarah Ezekiel loves colour. Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

More than 1,000 sites around the world – some cultural, some natural, some both – are protected by listing. Landmarks or areas are chosen for their value to humanity.On Friday, the World Heritage Committee announced the addition of the first of this year’s batch. More sites will be named over the weekend.Perhaps the most famous site to be added to the list is the city of Babylon in Iraq. The city was first mentioned in the 23rd century BC and may have been home to one of the seven wonders of the ancient world – the Hanging Gardens.But while Babylon has a history dazzling with palaces and temples, there is little to see of its oldest era and what is left has sustained substantial damage. Saddam Hussein built a replica palace there, while US-led military forces in the area during the Iraq war crushed ancient pavements with their vehicles and filled sandbags with material that included archeological fragments. Among the other sites listed are the Hyrcanian forests in Iran, an ancient metallurgy site in Burkina Faso, the French austral lands and seas, and the Ohrid region of Albania, which is cited for its natural and cultural heritage. Paraty and Ilha Grande in Brazil – popular destinations for tourists visiting Rio de Janeiro – are also recognised for both their natural and cultural significance.China has also gained a listing: the migratory bird sanctuaries along the coast of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Gulf. A haven for migratory birds and the home of myriad species of fish and crustaceans, this shoreline boasts a rich ecosystem and is considered to be the largest intertidal mudflat system in the world.The habitat depends on sediments: according to one report the Yellow River, which discharges into the Yellow Sea, carries an average of 24.7kg of sediment per cubic metre of water at its mouth.

The backdrop may be antiquity’s most famous site but before him is a sea of blue and white, the colour of the Greek flag being waved by the crowd.The man poised to become Greece’s next prime minister takes in the scene. “On Sunday Greece will become blue, the blue of the sky, the blue of the sea,” he thunders. “On Sunday we vote, on Monday we turn a page.”Three days before snap elections, the opposition leader is on a roll. Democracy can produce unexpected results but every analyst agrees this is an election of foregone conclusion.All polls point to victory for Mitsotakis’s centre-right New Democracy, with most suggesting the party is on course to win an outright majority in what would be a significant shift for a country governed by fragile coalitions for the past decade.On Thursday, a Pulse survey showed the conservatives leading the leftist Syriza by eight percentage points. If so, New Democracy would acquire between 155 and 159 seats in the 300-seat parliament repeating its spectacular performance in the European election in May which prompted the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to call the vote three months ahead of schedule.Mitsotakis, the son of a former premier who has been forced to face down accusations of privilege and nepotism, has new-found confidence.With the wind behind him, the cosmopolitan former banker has waged a tireless campaign, rolling up the sleeves of his crisp white shirts and criss-crossing the country to listen to the problems of ordinary Greeks. In a nation long on the frontline of Europe’s financial crisis, he has focused primarily on economic rejuvenation, promising to lower taxes, lure foreign investment and create jobs.“Standing here on this hallowed ground I am reminded of the ancients,” he told the crowd on Thursday night. “Power is not the goal it is just a tool to make the lives of citizens better.”Mitsotakis has been credited with rehabilitating one of Europe’s more traditional conservative parties, one that not that long ago was associated with the cronyism and corrupt policies blamed for the debt-stricken country’s financial woes.“What we are seeing is a personal victory for a liberal reformist leader. In many ways New Democracy is a discredited party held responsible for the problems that led Greece to requiring bailout programmes,” said the political analyst Aris Hatzis. “He has become a far better speaker, much more relaxed, much more confident.”After four and a half years of populist leftist rule under Tsipras, markets have also rejoiced at the prospect of a pro-business government being returned to power. Athens’s borrowing costs have hit record lows since the 26 May European vote.But dangers lurk. At Thursday’s rally – his first and last in Athens – Mitsotakis rammed home his most pressing message: the need for Greeks to get out and vote. While the 51-year-old has pursued a more consensual approach, promising to represent “all Greeks as prime minister whether they support us or not”, the spectre of a low turnout hangs over the summer poll. The election is the first since the collapse of military rule in 1974 to be held in July, a month when Greeks are either on holiday or weekending at the beach. With Greece in the grip of a heatwave, worries abound that many will give the ballot a miss.Mitsotakis’s ability to gain a working majority will also depend on how smaller parties fare. On the right, New Democracy faces competition from the neo-fascist Golden Dawn and the ultra-national Greek Solution, a new political formation that has channelled anger over the controversial name-change accord Tsipras sealed with North Macedonia last year.Syriza cadres have expressed mounting fears that Varoufakis, a former finance minister under Tsipras, will also pose a threat to a party that stormed to power in 2015 vowing to end the excoriating austerity demanded by bailout creditors. A maverick, who has since fallen out spectacularly with the 45-year-old Syriza leader, Varoufakis holds particular appeal among younger Greeks. “He has the cool factor,” said Nicolacopoulos of the telegenic showman.Athens received almost €300bn in rescue funds, the biggest bailout in global financial history between 2010 to 2015, as it battled bankruptcy and sought to remain in the eurozone.Almost a year after exiting its third and final economic adjustment programme, anger over continuing austerity lingers, even if the crisis appears to have subsided and Greeks are less prone to take to the streets in protest.If Mitsotakis wins big, analysts say it will be his chance to remould New Democracy in his own image. In private, the politician describes himself as a progressive and has signalled he will place untested technocrats in prominent positions once in government.“The scope of his victory will allow him to take the bold measures he seems ready to take,” said Hatzis. “If he wins an outright majority he will enjoy a period of political hegemony. It will be his chance to avoid becoming just another link in a series of short-term prime ministers we have seen in the bailout age.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

universities should be “bastions of debate and defenders of expression”Universities must not allow students to block pro-life or Christian societies due to “hypersensitivity”, the equalities chief has said.  David Isaac, chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, said universities should be “bastions of debate and defenders of expression”.  Speaking at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London on Thursday night, he criticised student unions which have attempted to bar Christian and pro-life societies from having stalls at Freshers’ Fairs or hiring rooms for events.  “This is not consistent with ensuring freedom of speech on campus, and the EHRC guidance makes clear that it should not happen,” he said. Mr Isaac was speaking at the launch of a report by the think-tank Theos about faith on campus.“We are living in an age of hypersensitivity where it is increasingly easier for people to feel offended - or others to be worried about protecting minority groups,” he said.  Last year, a pro-life student group was refused permission to set up stalls at three different university freshers’ fairs.The charity, called Life, wrote to the independent regulator of higher education in England to express concern about discriminatory behaviour and freedom of expression violations… by a number of university student unions. In 2017, an Oxford College banned the Christian Union from its freshers’ fair on the grounds that it would be “alienating” for students of other religions, and constitute a “micro-aggression”.The organiser of Balliol’s fair argued Christianity’s historic use as “an excuse for homophobia and certain forms of neo-colonialism” meant that students might feel “unwelcome” in their new college if the Christian Union had a stall.At the time,  the vice-president of Balliol’s Junior Common Room (JCR) committee, said that if a representative from the Christian Union attended the fair, it could cause potential harm to freshers.  Make language GCSE exams easier to stop them from dying out, private school chief says Melting down crisp packets and clingfilm could raise plastic recycling rates tenfold, say firmsHospital sued after wrong family gives permission for patient\u0026#39s life support to be switched off Comment: Boris the PM must act decisively in the first 100 days – or it will all end in tearsImmigrants should be forced to learn English, says Boris Johnson as he insists he is \u0026#39proud\u0026#39 of his gaffesTheresa May’s aides accused of \u0026#39playing petty politics\u0026#39 with security services in attempt to smear Boris JohnsonGeeks become the new jocks as British universities now have more gaming teams than football Huawei staff CVs reveal alleged links to Chinese intelligence agencies British family reunited with £300k painting looted by Nazis from their ancestorsNew plan to give veterans immunity from Troubles\u0026#39 prosecutionsBoris Johnson promises to prioritise the UK\u0026#39s integrity over Brexit, saying: \u0026#39The Union must come first\u0026#39Moscow thwarts downtown rally for teen girls who killed abusive fatherFoie gras made in a lab is on the menu as diners enjoy a guilt-free alternativeLabour faces fresh anti-Semitism row over appointment of new officialCalifornia has the biggest earthquake in 20 years: is it getting close to \u0026#39The Big One\u0026#39? Saudi princess facing Paris trial is victim of \u0026#39false accusations\u0026#39, says lawyerGermany convicts first \u0026#39Isil bride\u0026#39 in precedent-setting casePeacocks terrorise village, but council says locals will have to catch them themselvesChris Cline, America\u0026#39s \u0026#39King of Coal\u0026#39 killed in helicopter crashWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/05/TELEMMGLPICT000202859169_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"california has biggest earthquake 20 years getting close big","story":"The quake is the biggest in 20 yearsSouthern California residents awoke on Friday morning to a strong aftershock from the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in 20 years, which was felt by more than 20 million people. There have already been more than 80 smaller aftershocks since Thursday\u0027s 6.4 magnitude quake near the city of Ridgecrest, which was felt from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, seismologist Lucy Jones said.The 5.4 magnitude aftershock, the biggest so far, struck the same desert region as Thursday\u0027s earthquake.

But it appears that geeks have become the new jocks, as British universities now have more competitive gaming teams than any other sport.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than football, according to figures compiled and British Universities and College Sport (BUCS) and  National Student E-sports (NSE).E-sports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universities. There are 685 e-sports teams spread across 73 universities in the UK, compared to 662 football teams.The next most popular sport is hockey with 546 teams, followed by netball with 432 teams and then Rugby Union with 425 teams.Jon Tilbury, director at NSE which organises inter-university gaming tournaments, said that while university gaming societies have been around for 15 to 20 years, it is only in the past five years or so that they rapidly increased in popularity.Some societies now have hundreds of members, he said, and certain universities have separate societies for particular games.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than footballMr Tilbury said that the surge in interest from university students echoes the growth in the gaming industry more generally. “Interest in e-sports has been there for a long time,” Mr Tilbury said. “The wider e-sports community has grown massively, with professional teams paid big salaries and flown around the world to be in tournaments . “What we see is a lot of university students with technical skills getting involved, we have students who have developed their own custom software.”Some universities, which have a particular enthusiasm for gaming, have different societies for particular types of games, for example, Warwick University has a Nintendo Society as well as an E-sports Society. The average university e-sports team consists of 6.5 players, according to data from NSE. Around 90 per cent of players are male, 70 per cent of them are studying courses in STEM subjects.Mr Tilbury explained that inter-university games can be played by students from the comfort of their own bedrooms, but players would meet up in person for the final of a tournament.The NSE co-ordinates with BUCS, the umbrella organisation that organises sports matches, to ensure that gaming matches to do deter students from playing other sports, he added.   The most popular reason students cited for competing in gaming championships was making and maintaining friendships, and improving and becoming a better player, according to a survey by the NSE.Make language GCSE exams easier to stop them from dying out, private school chief says Melting down crisp packets and clingfilm could raise plastic recycling rates tenfold, say firmsHospital sued after wrong family gives permission for patient\u0026#39s life support to be switched off Comment: Boris the PM must act decisively in the first 100 days – or it will all end in tearsImmigrants should be forced to learn English, says Boris Johnson as he insists he is \u0026#39proud\u0026#39 of his gaffesTheresa May’s aides accused of \u0026#39playing petty politics\u0026#39 with security services in attempt to smear Boris JohnsonHuawei staff CVs reveal alleged links to Chinese intelligence agencies British family reunited with £300k painting looted by Nazis from their ancestorsNew plan to give veterans immunity from Troubles\u0026#39 prosecutionsBoris Johnson promises to prioritise the UK\u0026#39s integrity over Brexit, saying: \u0026#39The Union must come first\u0026#39Moscow thwarts downtown rally for teen girls who killed abusive fatherFoie gras made in a lab is on the menu as diners enjoy a guilt-free alternativeLabour faces fresh anti-Semitism row over appointment of new officialCalifornia has the biggest earthquake in 20 years: is it getting close to \u0026#39The Big One\u0026#39? Saudi princess facing Paris trial is victim of \u0026#39false accusations\u0026#39, says lawyerGermany convicts first \u0026#39Isil bride\u0026#39 in precedent-setting casePeacocks terrorise village, but council says locals will have to catch them themselvesChris Cline, America\u0026#39s \u0026#39King of Coal\u0026#39 killed in helicopter crashComment: Boris cannot expect to beat Brussels at no-deal chicken without facing down Tory rebelsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hope prix pictet 2019 photographic competition shortlist selection","story":"The Prix Pictet competition carries a prize of 100,000 Swiss Francs (about £80,700).

private school chief","story":"Mr Buchanan said that students tend to choose their GCSE subjects based on what they think they will do well inMake modern language GCSE exams easier to stop them from dying out, a private school chief has said as he warns that even the brightest students are shunning the subjects for fear that they will miss out on top grades.Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) which represents the country’s leading public schools including Eton, Harrow and Winchester, urged the exam watchdog to act. He said it is a “national scandal” that the teaching and learning of languages is “becoming the preserve of a minority of state and independent schools and even fewer universities”.Mr Buchanan, a former headmaster at the £36,900-a-year Ashford School in Kent, said that students tend to choose their GCSE subjects based on what they think they will do well in.“They are weighing up their options and if they are ambitious and want to go to a highly ranked university, they are sometimes choosing subjects on that basis,” he told The Daily .“This is certainly the case for the most able students. There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.” Melting down crisp packets and clingfilm could raise plastic recycling rates tenfold, say firmsHospital sued after wrong family gives permission for patient\u0026#39s life support

Shame on you.”Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said: “Nigel Farage is facing some stiff competition as chief clown of the Brexit Party in the European parliament.

Widdecombe’s comments trivialise the suffering of those who have experienced slavery and colonialism,” he told The Independent after the speech.“If Ann Widdecombe had any grip on reality, she would have the sense to look at her own record on oppressing women and minorities when she defended shackling pregnant women and opposed repealing Section 28.

Markle, the father of the actress and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, is of Dutch-Irish origin and is  years old.He is a former television lighting director working on iconic US shows including Married with Children and General Hospital.In  he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction for a Drama Series for his work on General Hospital, a long-running US soap.Thomas Markle married Doria Ragland in .The family settled down in The Valley, LA, but Thomas and Doria split in .Meghan was six years old at the time.Past social media posts show that Meghan has a lot of love for her father.Happy Fathers Day, daddy. Im still your buckaroo, and to this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world, the star wrote on Instagram in .Thomas Markle was all set to walk his daughter down the aisle for her marriage to Prince Harry in May, .But he pulled out just days before the event, citing health problems.Their already strained relationship suffered further blows after a series of blundering press interviews given by Markle Snr about Meghan.It is not yet clear whether they will reconcile, or whether Thomas will meet his new grandson, baby Archie.Thomas Markle revealed the contents of a deeply personal letter written to him by the Duchess.Meghan accused him of “creating so much pain” and “exploiting” her relationship with Harry in an explosive five-page note.Meghan wrote to her estranged dad begging him to stop victimising her after she married Prince Harry, it is claimed.The Duchess of Sussex gave Thomas Markle an olive branch after telling him I have one father - but incredibly he responded by shamelessly asking for a photoshoot with her.In the five-page letter it is thought she wrote he had broken her heart into a million pieces after he failed to attend her wedding.She writes: “I begged you to accept help – we sent someone to your home…and instead of speaking to me to accept this or any help, you stopped answering your phone and chose to only speak to tabloids.”The Duchess adds: “If you love me, as you tell the press you do, please stop.“Please allow us to live our lives in peace.”Five close friends told People magazine that Meghan had been left absolutely devastated by her dads response.Thomas told the Mail on Sunday that the gut-wrenching five-page letter was not an “olive branch” but a dagger to the heart” which left him “devastated.”But according to his other daughter, Samantha, he is prepared to release more material.“It was nasty. Dad is prepared to release more of it, the -year-old told The Sun.It comes after a turbulent  months for Meghan since her relationship with Prince Harry was revealed, with her family repeatedly cashing in on her rising profile.Meghans family drama has seen Thomas interviewed on national television, calling his daughter controlling while her half-sister Samantha Markle regularly takes to social media to criticise her.But speaking anonymously, the pals revealed the -year-old had tried to reach out to her -year-old dad after he pulled out of walking her down the aisle and gave a string of interviews with the press.In the letter, the pregnant duchess reportedly wrote: I have one father. Please stop victimizing me through the media.Thomas Markle has not yet spoken publicly about his grandson, baby Archie, but will not be attending the christening on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels fish no deal brexit waters","story":"EU officials said continental trawlermen must prepare for the possibility they will no longer be able to land catches in UK seas after October .In a new paper they said they will try to get an agreement on fishing with the next British PM but are mobilising funds to prevent mass job lossesthat fails.And the paper warned of the possibility No Deal could spark a free-for-all between coastal nations vying for the remaining fish stocks in EU waters.The warning will raise hopes for Tory leadership candidates that they may be able to squeak a deal through - as the EU will lose out without one.And it added the EU will seek a specic arrangement with the UK in accordance with international law obligations and based on scientic advice for .EU officials also berated businesses on the continent for failing to prepare properly for a crash out, ordering them to up their game.They also claimed that Britains economy would take a nose-drivetheres a No Deal - just as Boris launched his campaign to be leader.Eurocrats predicted the UK will face signicant disruption and a serious negative economic impactwe leave without an agreement in October.The Commission said No Deal very much remains a possible, although undesirable, outcome given the political situation in the UK.And it stressed: In a No Deal scenario, the UK will become a third country without any transitional arrangements.This will obviously cause signicant disruption for citizens and businesses and would have a serious negative economic impact, which would be proportionally much greater in the UK than in the EU.Eurocrats said visits to all  capitals over the last year had shown a high degree of preparation by Member States for all scenarios. "},{"url":null,"title":"dominic grieve no deal brexit charge democracy","story":"Grieve, the Tory MP for Beaconsfield, is a leading Remoaner.And like other Remoaners he has spent much of the past three years whipping up panic about the dreadful impact Brexit will allegedly have on our country.A No Deal Brexit — or “crashing out of the EU”, as Remoaners dramatically call it — would be especially bad, he says.For three years the Brexit-bashing set have spread mad fears about how leaving the EU without a deal will turn the UK into a hellhole in which medicine will run out, food will be scarce and there could even be “violent unrest” as the starving masses ­struggle to survive.Make no mistake, they say, a No Deal Brexit will plunge the UK into chaos.So Grieve came up with a plan to ensure No Deal never happens, which until last night could have sent a wrecking ball right through Parliament.Before Speaker John Bercow decided not to let them be put forward, Grieve and his fellow Demolition Dame, ­Labour’s Margaret Beckett, tabled amendments to the way government spending is authorised in Parliament.In a nutshell, they would have threatened to plunge the UK into chaosany future Prime Minister pursues No Deal.Yes, that’s right: The latest wheeze of the Brexitphobic elite is to prevent the alleged chaos of a No Deal Brexit by bringing about their own kind of chaos instead.The stalled plan — stalled because it can still be re­tabled today or in the next Parliamentary sitting targeting dferent departments’ spending — gives new meaning to the word hypocrisy.It proposed to make it impossible for the Government to fund certain public services unless it promises to ditch the idea of No Deal.Under the amendments, four government departments would have been prevented from spending moneythe Government pursues No Deal.Those were: The Department for Education, the ­Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Department for International Development.These departments are ­central to everyday le.Imaginethe Government was physically and legally prevented from spending money on schools, or housing, or transport, or on people’s ­pensions.There would be mayhem.Bus routes could grind to a halt. Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt.

And I’m going to swing by and take a dump in your garden and decapitate a thrush.There are few more selfish people than cat owners. If you can’t keep your cat confined on your own property, don’t have a cat.And isn’t it about time we started fining cat owners when they fail to pick up after their pet has defecated AS you probably gathered, I don’t have too much time for Jeremy Corbyn.He’s a dimbo who buys all the adolescent, far-left stupidity. Policies which were dated decades ago.But I am totally on his side when it comes to his battle with the civil service. Someone within that smug organisation leaked an official “worry” that Corbyn was “too frail” to carry outThat was cruel, spiteful and politically motivated.The civil service is against Corbyn because they don’t agree with his policies. Well, me neither. But the civil service is there to carry out the bidding of WHOEVER we elect, even Magic Grandpa.The problem is that the civil service is heavily biased, just like the BBC. Not so much to the left as towards the liberal viewpoint on all things.We saw this during the Brexit negotiations, when one civil servant broke cover and told The Sunday Times that the entire civil service was against Brexit and did its best to undermine it.We need a clear out of these time servers, cocooned in their middle-class bubble.HERE’S Alex Morgan, scorer of the goal which knocked our Lionesses out of the World Cup.She annoyed people by miming the act of drinking tea.

He got quite cross and shouted stuff. So that’s TWO arguments with women in  years.I have two arguments with women every bloody day that God sends. I think there must be something wrong with Boris that he gets on with them so well.The next revelation from Boris’s nosy neighbours or ex-girlfriends  “Boris Johnson sings Dire Straits songs while he’s having a shower.”And “Boris would sometimes use the butter kne to spread marmalade on his toast, leaving a small residue of butter in the marmalade jar.”WHO the hell is Jason Mohammad  That’s the question most of the country was asking this week.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games. Do you like whack-a-mole or are you more of an apple bobber, plunging your head into a barrel of cold water to try to bite an elusive Granny Smith Bouncy castles, face-painting, white-elephant stalls, the suggestive-carrots display, guess-the--of-the-sausage-dog or the dreaded bric-a-brac stall: These are the daft indulgences of the British summer. Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed. Brexit bamboozles them — “But why do you wish to leave our European Union ” They really don’t get it.My advice to our foreign friends is this: Follow the bunting and get yourself to a neighbourhood summer beano.Visit a fête and you will soon understand the British character. Bloody-minded,  quirky, unassuming, unfazed about politically-correct crazes.Fêtes are a telling combination of romantic tradition and anarchy. No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tomorrow San Juan is going to disappear! I came to save the world, and I’m going to end terrorism!”The man yelled before members of the cabin crew overpowered him with the help of a few brave passengers.Ramírez’s outburst shortly after takeoff forced the pilots toto San Juan, where police took him into custody.The roughly  passengers waited at the gate before the flight took off again for JFK, where it landed at .pm, more than two hours late, Delta spokesperson Michael Thomas told New York Post.Several rattled passengers described the drama, which left some in tears, after their arrival in New York.Moraima Garcia Rohena, a passenger on the flight, said the plane was still climbing after takeoff when the man got up and walked toward the front.She said: “When he got to the middle of the plane the flight attendants tried to stop him. They said, ‘Stop! Stop! You cannot be walking.“He didn’t stop, he continued. The flight attendants — three of them — stood up and told him he cannot be there.They told him, ‘You need to back off!’ He started saying that he was God and he was preventing a catastrophe on the plane.She added: “Then he tried to open the cockpit door. He banged on it but he couldn’t get it open.“The passengers restrained him. One of the flight attendants went to the back to get something to restrain him.

My second reaction was to worry. I got to go back home to my mother and my siblings.“One thing I do want to give to Delta is they were able to turn that plane around real fast.Michael, the Delta spokesman, said the cockpit’s door remain locked and secure during the incident and that earlier reports that the captain arrested the suspect were inaccurate.He said: “Delta applauds the quick action and professionalism of the crew of Delta flight .The FBI has launched an investigation, but spokeswoman Limary Cruz-Rubio said she did not have additional details.Just yesterday, a plane was evacuated as terried passengers ran across the runway after an -year-old boy wrote a note saying there was a bomb on board, signed the terrorist.All  passengers on board the Vueling flight were told to evacuate just minutes before the scheduled take-off time to Santiago.Emergency procedures were activated after a letter was handed to the pilot claiming a device with glycerin inside was hidden on board.Last week,  Brit tourists were hauled off a plane in Israel after one of them allegedly threatened to blow up the aircraft.The passengers, who were all male, were ejected from the British Airways plane at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.Some of the group, who were all male, are alleged to have made antisemitic jokes about other passengers after boarding the flight to London Heathrow.A version of this story has previously appeared on the New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"jet2 flight chloe haines emergency exit","story":"Chloe Haines, , had to be restrained by fellow passengers after reportedly screaming Im going to kill everyone just  minutes into the flight from Stansted Airport.Two RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to intercept the Airbus  after a hijack alert was sparked on the flight bound for Turkey.Passengers revealed they were terried as shocking footage showed staff pinning down the young woman as she started screaming.Today the Sun Online can reveal the woman is a Costa Coffee worker who lives at home with her family in Maidenhead, Berkshire.It can also be revealed she was convicted of drink-driving just two weeks before the Jet incident.Speaking today, one friend said they didnt know why Chloe had started to kick off, adding: Shes quite worried about it.She could go to prison and face a hefty fine.Describing her as a girl about town, he said she had previously faced problems with drinking.On June , she was banned from the road for  months after drink-driving and ordered to pay £ court costs.She was also given a series of community orders for three assaults and fined £ at Slough Magistrates Court.Chloe, who went to Newlands Girls School, Maidenhead, currently works at a Costa Express branch in the south-east.Speaking to the Sun Online yesterday, relatives outside her home said she wasnt there and wouldnt want to talk.Jet vowed to prosecute Chloe over the incident in a strongly-worded statement after she was pulled from the plane.Essex Police confirmed officers arrested a -year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and endangering an aircraft. She has been released on bail until July .Witnesses earlier revealed how they were in fear for their lives after their fellow passenger went for the exit door as they flew to Dalaman in Turkey on June .Amy Varol, who sat two rows behind, told The Sun Online: The woman was walking down the aisle when she literally ran to the exit door.She had her hands on the handle trying to open it.Luckily there were two cabin crew there who pulled her off the door.Ms Varol continued: She started assaulting the two crew members, a woman and a man.A big guy then literally threw her down to the floor and there was one person holding one arm and another person holding the other.Then a man sat on her and one person was holding her leg and someone  holding the other one.Thats when she started screaming get off me, Im going to kill everyone.And a former bouncer revealed how he tackled the woman to the ground during the hijack alert.Steven Brown, , said: She was punching, kicking and screaming at the stewards, they were trying to stop her but they had no chance.She was only petite but she had the strength of a fully-grown man.

These consequences include huge fines, letime bans and court action. They now also include the authorities having to scramble fighter jets to escort commercial aircraft, proof that this behaviour must stop now.Describing the passengers behaviour as extremely disruptive, they thanked crew and passengers for assisting on the flight.Many people living near Stansted phoned police to report a loud noise they thought could be an explosion when the RAF Typhoons were scrambled to the flight.A sonic boom is created when supersonic aircraft accelerate through the sound barrier - which is banned over land except in emergencies.Cops confirmed Chloe was not detained under the mental health act.Essex Police confirmed at the time of the incident: A woman arrested at Stansted Airport over the weekend has since been released on bail.The -year-old, from Maidenhead in Berkshire, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and endangering an aircraft.She has been released on bail until Tuesday  July.Jet have been approached by the Sun Online for further comment, and Costa declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need to get a move on.Decent-minded voters are being pushed towards extremes like Jeremy Corbyn and the Brexit party because mainstream politicians have failed so far to deliver.Abroad, I see the whole time as ­Foreign Secretary the way that other countries look at us and wonder what on earth is going on.So more than anything  the choice in this leadership contest is about who can deliver Brexit.It’s not about the best soundbite, or speech, or piece of rhetoric. But about who can actually deliver.What we need is a negotiator. Someone who has taken risks to start up their own business. Someone with trusted relationships across Europe that can be used to get a better deal. I believe I am that person.Others may have promised £million for the NHS on the side of a bus, but I was the Health Secretary who negotiated with a tight-fisted Treasury to actually deliver it. I can do the same to deliver Brexit.And I’ve got the plan to do it. If we ramp up No Deal preparations we can show Brussels we are serious in our intent.And with a new negotiating team we can get the changes needed to get a deal that the country should support.With the right person in charge we can get out and get out quickly.Once we have Brexit done we can start focusing on the big challenges that affect our lives:First, how do we turbocharge our economy  When I was in my twenties I started my own tech business which I grew until it employed hundreds of people.I know what it takes to get the mojo back in our economy.It means cutting corporation tax to Irish levels and slashing business rates so that  per cent of high street shops do not have to pay them.If we get it right we can park an ­economic jumbo jet off the coast of Europe and ensure that in the trade negotiations they need us every bit as much as we need them.Second, how do we stop the threat of Corbyn and show young people they can trust the Conservative Party again Jeremy Corbyn is the most left-wing, anti-British Labour leader in history.He represents a threat to millions of jobs and would damage our security. But at the last election millions of young people were tempted to take the risk. Why  Because the most basic part of human dignity is having somewhere decent to live. For too many young people that’s just too hard.People of my generation found buying a house straightforward. Since then house prices have ballooned but average incomes have not.It’s left a generational ide between young and old that is as bad as any ide created by the Referendum. So we have to have a plan to make buying a house more affordable for young people.Margaret Thatcher had a policy called ‘Right to Buy’ that got millions on to the housing ladder for the first time.Mine is called ‘Right to Own’ and it will do the same. I will take advantage of the massive leap in land value that comes from councils granting planning permission by ensuring the benefit of it goes directly to young people, rather than into the pockets of developers.Combined with new planning regulations to allow people to build up, with more storeys on top of apartment blocks, this will deliver the new homes we need.In total my plan will deliver . million more homes in ten years — giving a whole generation a leg up on to the housing ladder.It will give them the dignity and the security of a home they can call their own. That’s the best way to win the next generation — showing them that it’s the Conservative Party that has the practical solutions to the problems they face. Where Corbyn talks, Conservatives do.Third, we need to have a plan to get Britain standing tall in the world again.Nothing has given me more pride than to represent Britain abroad as Foreign Secretary. But while Brexit should be a moment for us to step up in the world, the way we’ve handled it has left the rest of the world scratching their heads. Britain deserves better.My dad was in the Navy. It was his generation that won the Cold War without firing a shot.They did that because we won the battle of ideas. But also because the USSR knew we were ready to defend ourselves. So as Britain enters a new chapter in its history, I want to equip us for a new role.We’re a world leader in soft power — our media, our culture and our universities, but I want our hard power to match that.So I will back our brave troops with a major boost to our defence spending, giving them the resources they need to do the job we ask of them. By raising defence spending from  per cent to . per cent we can afford the kit and capabilities to face new battles against new enemies.But more than that, showing the world that, just as our parents’ generation stood tall in the Cold War, Britain will always be there to defend and protect those values. This, then, is my plan for Britain: get Brexit done, stop Corbyn, build more homes, and get us standing tall in the world.Deliver it and we can take advantage of the amazing opportunities this country has.The best universities in the world. The most exciting companies. The world’s language and can-do people that have changed history.It’s a plan to bring people together and deliver Brexit.Back it and we can unite as a country and win again.He would slash business taxes to boost the economy and create jobs. He would raise defence spending substantially.Crucially he has a plan to build .million homes. That is what’s needed to deliver the Tory property-owning dream to millennials priced out of the market.Mr Hunt is an excellent Foreign Secretary and could make a good PM.

We have detained the vessel and its cargo.Mr Picardo also praised the bravery of all those who detained the ship - which was closing in on its apparent destination when stopped.I want to thank the brave men and women of the Royal Marines, the Royal Gibraltar Police, HM Customs Gibraltar and the Gibraltar Port Authority for their work in securing the detention of this vessel and its cargo, he said.Be assured that Gibraltar remains safe, secure and committed to the international, rules-based, legal order.Its believed the massive ship - which is more than m in-  left the Kharg Island oil terminal in Iran in mid-April.The tanker then reappeared near the Iranian port of Bandar Assaluyeh fully loaded.After anchoring off the United Arab Emirates coast, the vessel headed , miles around Africa towards the Mediterranean.According to shipping records, the Grace  formally identied its cargo as having been loaded in Iraq, thus avoiding the US sanctions on Iran.However, tracking websites said it had not docked in Iraq at the relevant time and its a satellite identication system was turned off.Years of conflict have drained its resources and it now needs to procure more than  per cent of its fuel from overseas.With the strict sanctions in place, Damascus desperately needs to regain control of its oil fields in the east.However, at the moment they are in the hands of the heavily-armed US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.Domestic oil production in  reached , barrels a day -  per cent of its needs - down from , a day before the war.Government officials say they now need £. billion worth of subsidised fuel every year.Iran, which offered vital military support to Bashar Assad, was the main provider.However, the credit line Iran extended since  to supply oil has run dry and its oil shipments seemingly stopped late last year.This followed US sanctions imposed on a network that spanned Syria, Iran and Russia which was responsible for shipping oil to Assads government.It later showed up near the Iranian port of Assaluyeh, fully loaded and then travelled the long route to Syria round the Cape of Good Hope, avoiding the more straightforward journey through the Suez Canal, which is more easily monitored.Tanker trackers estimate that the ship carries two million barrels of oil.Tehran has fiercely denied any involvement in the twin attacks on the pair of tankers.After the operation, Mr Picardo said he has now written to the presidents of the European Commission and European Council to give details of the sanctions that have been enforced.The EU has imposed a series of sanctions against Bashar Assads regime in Syria in response to the conflict in the country.The Syrian Sanctions Regime, established in May , comprises financial, trade and transport restrictions.The bloc imposed sanctions on  Syrian officials including government ministers over their role in the violent repression of civilians.It has also introduced an embargo on Syrian oil and a strict freeze on Syrian bank assets within the EU.The Foreign Office said: We welcome this firm action by the Gibraltarian authorities, acting to enforce the EU Syria Sanctions regime. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister has repeatedly refused to intervene in Stormontaposs affairs, despite United Nations condemnation.Now Labour MP Stella Creasy has headed up a cross-party bid to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland - while her colleague Conor McGinn is leading a charge for same-sex marriage in the province. The group are hijacking a Bill in the House of Commons next week which gives the Northern Ireland Secretary, based in Westminster, powers in the absence of devolved Government. The Westminster government has come under pressure to bring legislation in Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK after the Republic of Ireland voted in referendums to legalise both abortion and same sex marriage. But Downing Street insist both issues are matters for the devolved administration in Stormont which hasn’t sat for more than two and a half years.  Parliament will debate a bill on Monday that will push back the prospect of a Stormont election until  October and could allow a further extension to January there is no breakthrough. Stella Creasy said she has tabled a number of amendments hoping that one will get through.These have backing from Labour, Lib Dem, Independent, Tory, Green and SNP MPs - will oblige the Northern Ireland Secretary to ensure human rights compliance in relation to abortion law.The government has insisted abortion is a health issue and falls under the jurisdiction of the Stormont Assembly but the UNaposs Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Womendisagrees. In February , CEDAW found that Northern Ireland’s women are subjected to grave and systematic violations of rights through being compelled to either travel outside Northern Ireland to procure a legal abortion or to carry their pregnancy to term.  While in June , the UK Supreme Court found that the law was in need of ‘radical reconsideration’ and ‘treated women like vehicles’. The UK’s most senior judges found that the law breached human rights in the cases of sexual violence and fatal fetal anomalies. Stella Creasy MP told the Mirror: “It’s no good for people criticising the human rights record of America while ignoring our own human rights violations. “It’s time to treat every woman in the UK equally and ensure that every woman can get a safe, legal and local abortionshe wants one. “It’s the local bit that matters because asking them to travel - that’s not equality.” Unlike in the rest of the United Kingdom, abortion is illegal in all circumstances in Northern Ireland with heavy jail sentences for both women and any medical professionals who assist them. More than  women a year travel to England or Wales for a termination, with many more unable to do so. But the campaign will need Tory MPs to rebel in order to change the law.

Perhaps readmittance to the Conservative Party, a safe seat, or an agreement to stand aside in Leave areas and let the Batsh****rs have a clear run. Itaposs been suggested he might offer a peerage, infor the insurgent party being mothballed in the way that all limited companies can be. Pictureyou will Lord Whiny of Garage, failed public school boy, failed husband, and  times a failed MP, clad in ermine and finally gted a right to rule over us.And in the House of Lords, whereaposd he be about as welcome as a pimple on a porn staraposs bum.   Hunt would be more likely to plump for reason over populism, and fight for a sane and steady Brexit that has as much hope of winning as a one-legged donkey. Whichever of them is PM, and whatever strategy they choose to fight a general election, neither Hunt or Johnson can win.Even - and this is the important bit to remember - even WITH the help of a hugely-popular Brexit Party. General elections arenapost like locals, when no-one cares. Theyaposre not like the Euros, with a system that allows unelectable people to be put on a list and pretend a popularity theyaposd never otherwise have. A general election demands not only a majority to win, but for that popularity to be repeated in a minimum of  constituencies nationwide. Andeveryonecares about them. Remainers, Leavers, atheists, Communists, Muslims, EU citizens: everyone. Theyaposll care about it even more after  years of government by goons, followed by a PM they didnapost get to pick and who turned out to be more of the same.  General elections require groundwork. Labour won in Peterborough and Newport, despite having the least popular leader in history, because they had activists knocking on doors, talking about local issues and presenting a human face to recall when the voter saw names on a piece of paper. Despite losing an estimated , members in the past year, it still has a massive network of people to call on, many of them young and enthusiastic.The Conservative Party has , members, the vast majority of whom are white males with an average age in their middle s. They too have a committed machine that can organise, although nowhere near as vast. While both main parties have problems convincing donors to part with their money at the moment, they will cough upa change of government is threatened. The Lib Dems have more than , members, including a whole bunch of new councillors. The Greens have around ,, with a recent boost from the climate change protests, and disaffected Corbynistas.The Brexit Party has  shareholders. They can throw a rave, but they wonapost get people to knock many doors. Supporters will argue they didnapost need activists to win the Euros. But there they won with limited support in massive constituencies, and still took less than half the seats available:  out of a potential . They have one local councillor,  Welsh assembly members, and zero membership rights.They have , registered supporters. But as has been exhaustively pointed out, their funding sources are questionable, which means the identitiesof these alleged people is entirely unknown. Itaposs not built for democracy, but demagoguery.Farage has no troops for a battle. He has no hardware. He has computer data, social media profiles and the like, and many believe that is enough to sway a signicant chunk of the electorate. But last time I checked, Facebook thought I was a man who likes soft jazz, so donapost bank on its brilliance.Farage, like Vladimir Putin who he so admires, can talk a good war. He can rile the easily-fooled, and get people to put their hands in their pockets. But in the same way he has never been photographed buying somebody  a pint, he has never in  years been able to persuade a majority of voters, plus one, to back him. UKIP once commanded m votes in the United Kingdom. But they were so dispersed across the country there was not enough in one place to generate a single Parliamentary seat. When that party ed one solitary MP in , it was with a majority that had plummeted from , to ,. UKIP made turncoat Douglas Carswell less popular, not more so.  And remember - this was when Brexit still looked possible, even positive. Today one of the Brexit Party candidates admits it will lead to  years of economic stre. Jacob Rees-Mogg reckons itaposs nearer , and both prospective PMs say it will cost billions in subsidies to save just some of the businesses likely to go bust.Brexit seems beyond the reach of the self-cannibalising Tories, while Labouraposs destructive ambiguity has killed its chances of government stone-dead. Neither Red or Blue has a cat in hellaposs chance of forming a government alone.There is a slim chance that, under Johnson, the Tories would strike a deal with Farage and scrape together enough seats to rule with the help of the DUP and the absentee Sinn Fein. But they would be even less likely to agree a fresh deal with the EU, or survive another vote of no confidencethey attempted to leave without one. The Lib Dems and Greens will do well in the impending election butthey co-operated with each other, they could sweep the board in the south, west, and London. Elsewhere, the Labour heartlands have abandoned their backing for Brexit as manufacturers have deserted them, and a Labour Party which backed Remain or a second referendum strongly enough could scoop up seats in Wales, the north, and Scotland.Remain or Leave, we all need a ing government. We wonapost get onewe continue with this Brexit madness. The only chance for stability, and sanity - and, entirely coincidentally, for Remaining in the EU - is a Rainbow Coalition of yellow, green and red.Plaid Cymru and the Greens have already agreed to stand aside in the Brecon by-election. Labour refused in Peterborough. Jeremy Corbyn needs to stop worrying about the Tories, who are toast, and do whataposs best for Britain."},{"url":null,"title":"22 stone bridesmaid who ruined","story":"News-stone bridesmaid who ruined pals wedding photos sheds huge amount of weightLucy Mitchell was mortied when she saw the snaps from her friends wedding day and has now lost nine stoneShareCommentsByJane Lavender:,  JUL NewsLucy was horried at the photos of her as a bridesmaid \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWith a smile plastered on her face Lucy Mitchell stood next to her friend on what should have been one of the happiest days of her le. She had been chosen as a bridesmaid - but instead of revelling in the celebrations, Lucy felt an overwhelming sense of guilt. At  stone and in a size  dress, Lucyaposs smike was fake because she was so worried she was ruining her palaposs wedding snaps. She had spent the day desperately avoiding standing with the rest of the wedding party when photos were being taken. Lucy even deleted the only photo she had taken with the bride because she was so upset with how she looked.    But as she was heading back to Kent from the ceremony in Ireland her friend messaged her some snaps. Lucy said: I was just horried. There was one side-on and another back view which were diabolical. When I saw them I actually told my friend I thought I’d ruined her wedding photos. I’d forced myself to smile during the day but seeing those photos and knowing I didn’t have a single one of me and one of her together even though she’s one of my closest friends from university, I was heartbroken.This was in August  and the wedding proved to be a real turning point for Lucy, who has now shed an amazing nine stone.   She said: I’d joined Slimming World six months earlier, but not really committed to it so I’d only lost about a stone. Those photos were what really pushed me because I didn’t ever want to feel that way about myself again, nobody should.” Lucy’s weight began to creep up while she was doing her nursing training. Now in her s and a matron level nurse practitioner working in primary care, she says irregular hours added to the stress of her job meant she often had an unhealthy diet. Lucy explained: I was always busy, so I’d often have to grab food whenever it was convenient, and work was emotional.    Looking back, I was at my biggest –  stones and a size   - when I was training and I was a comfort eater. It was often so late when I finished work, especiallyI’d had a poorly patient or someone was critically unwell, so I wouldn’t feel like cooking. I’d just grab a takeaway on the way home, for comfort and to unwind. “I’d graze watching TV and then go to bed because I was shattered, so my eating patterns were terrible.” When she decided to go to Slimming World groups weekly and commit to the Food Optimising plan, Lucy admits she was filled with self-loathing.    She said: I didn’t even own a full- mirror so I never looked at myself properly – I had a little pocket mirror to do my make-up and I only ever used that. I never saw myself full- because I don’t think I’d have left the houseI did. But I just got to the point where I thought, I don’t want to feel unhappy anymore, and I don’t want to self-loathe because it’s debilitating to feel that way about yourself. It affects every aspect of your le. Lucy also had another shock moment that made her want to lose weight - a career milestone that should have been one of her proudest days. She said: As you go up in seniority as a nurse practitioner, wearing your navy blues is a big thing.    You need to feel confident wearing them because people are looking to you – not just patients but the people who work with you. I thought I’d feel overjoyed when I put mine on for the first time, but actually it was tight and I was afraid to sit down in case it split. I’d ordered a size  thinking I’d lose weight by the time it arrived but I hadn’t lost enough, I was still a size . Lucy says as soon as her relationship with food started to change for the better, so did her self-esteem and her whole persona. And she found it surprisingly easy to stick to a new way of eating. Lucy said: Quite early on I read that willpower is like a muscle – the more you use it, the stronger it gets. I really believe that. The more I changed things up and said no to things that weren’t on the plan, the more I felt in control finally.” The support from her group has been a major factor, she adds, as well as connections she’s made through her Slimming World Instagram account.Lucy said: It can be quite a lonely journey and people who haven’t been morbidly obese can’t really empathise. But the friends I’ve made through social media are just the most amazing people and I don’t feel lonely anymore because of them. Now, Lucyaposs Sundays involve her batch cooking meals so she can reheat them at work and she takes Lucy now batch cooks meals on a Sunday so she can reheat them at work, and she always has plenty of fruit for snacking. She said: Meal prepping and planning has been absolutely essential. I’ve always been a foodie but now I have a structure and it’s healthy food. I used to have biscuits and a cup of tea for breakfast, and now I’ll do overnight oats or hard-boiled eggs. Lunch was sandwiches with crisps and cakes which the patients always brought in, but now it’s tuna pasta salad or chicken salad. And instead of takeaways at night I’ll make Thai food, chilli or curries, andI know I’m going to be home late I’ll use my slow cooker.

Lauren Etchells, , had allegedly been on the run in Europe for almost three years after defying a court order banning her from taking the girl out of Canada, according to police. She allegedly abducted the child, then aged  months, after her relationship with her we, Tasha Brown, broke down. Ms Brown, , hasnapost seen the girl since she was a toddler in September , and she hopes she will soon be reunited with the four-year-old following the arrest of Etchells, say police.  The girl was safe and in good health, said police. The group claimed they had been on holiday in France and decided to pop over to Jersey for a visit. Etchells, a dual British-Canadian citizen who gave birth to the girl, and Ms Brown had used a sperm donor and were raising their daughter on Vancouver Island in the province of British Columbia.   But Etchells, formerly of South Shields, allegedly boarded a flight from Vancouver to London Gatwick Airport in September  with the child and her then-partner, Marco van der Merwe, and their newborn son, CBC News reported. Ms Brown reported the daughter missing, sparking a search across continents as Etchells - wanted on an Interpol red notice - allegedly evaded police in Britain and a number of other countries. The search finally came to an end this week when Etchells and the daughter were found in a dinghy that came ashore on Jersey on Monday, said the Saanich Police Department, based in the Canadian city of Victoria.  They were with her son and Etchellsapos parents Brian and Angela, said police. A police spokesperson said: The group was spotted landing a -foot inflatable dinghy on the shores just south of St Catherineaposs, Jersey, a small island in the English Channel. When questioned as to their plans, they advised they were holidaying in France and decided to pop over to Jersey for a visit.  None of the five passengers had passports and it quickly became apparent to officials that their story did not add up. When the Jersey Police learned of their identities, they believed the group may have been attempting to get to the UK via Jersey in order to avoid passport control on UK soil. Etchells and her parents, both aged , were arrested for offences relating to child neglect and immigration. All three have pleaded guilty to the Jersey charges, and Etchells remains in custody as a result of an arrest warrant for her extradition to Canada, said police.  Police said Etchells had taken her daughter and son from Canada to England, and on to France, the Netherlands and the Middle East, and possibly to Spain and Portugal while on the run. At some point she ended her relationship with van der Merwe and continued to travel with the children using their British passports, it is alleged. In a statement released by police, Ms Brown, who had issued multiple appeals through the media, said: “I am extremely grateful to learn that her daughter is in good health and good care.  I am celebrating today. [My daughter] is alive, and we know where she is! But I can’t celebrate % yet. Not until [my daughter] is back in Canada. It is for this reason that I am spending today with my lawyer, and the ious other agencies involved in bringing [my daughter] home safely and…SOON!! But there is a lot I still need to do. For now, I wish to thank some of the people and agencies that have helped, including: Elisabeth Strain and the Saanich Police Department for their devotion to this case, along with Global Affairs Canada and the Central Authorities in Victoria, BC and London, UK. Today would not be happening without these special people.  I am also grateful for the love I received from the friends and family who kept me going during the lowest of lows. I guess a person can survive on hope. Thank you all for this reminder. She also thanked her supporters in a video posted on YouTube.

The auxiliary coastguards with  years experience between them have been dismissed because, technically they had been stood down from the incident by their bosses. The men say they are going to appeal against their dismissals - and a campaign to reinstate them is underway.

I was confident that the coastguard would be on hand to help the distressed customer. On all occasions, I have found the person in distress does not think rationally and just wants to get their car or pet back safely. This is when things can go wrong and possibly fatal.

Sir Trevor, , added that staff there seemed “genuine in their care and affection” for the animals.But the Mirror can reveal it is the same facility that came under fire after Michael Portillo visited on his BBC Great Indian Railway Journeys show last year.And photos taken months ago, posted on the Facebook page of the Elefantastic sanctuary, show tourists on the backs of elephants as they are washed.   One blogger who visited earlier this year even daubed “I Love NY” on the side of one of the animals in gaudy paint.They said: “While painting the elephant was a ton of fun, taking them for walks, like it’s your own pet, was a once-in-a-letime experience.” Campaigners say there is no “ethical way” to climb on an elephant as they are not designed to carry weight on their backs.ITV said the show made “very clear to the viewer the controversy surrounding the issue of elephants being kept in captivity” and that it “no way condones the riding of these majestic animals”.Sir Trevor accepts in the documentary that letting tourists paint the elephants “has been criticized”. He says elephants have often been “exploited, held captive, abused and used for entertainment”, adding there “is still a long way to go” to protect them.  ITV added: “Programme-makers sought and were given clear assurances that elephant rides were not being conducted at the sanctuary shown, and acted in good faith on the basis of the information received.” A source added: “Whilst at the sanctuary, the team saw no evidence of such activity.”But animal rights campaigners said ITV failed to adequately research the facility before giving it air time.Audrey Gaffney, of the Ethical Bucket List, said: “Sir Trevor has made a genuine attempt to discuss issues concerning captive elephants. He does grasp that they suffer in many of the captive situations. But it is very disappointing to see him visit this facility though which is a very clear case of failure on behalf of the researchers.”   Dr Chris Draper of the Born Free Foundation said: “Elephants do not need to be washed, petted or painted by humans, nor to be managed as part of a tourist attraction. A genuine sanctuary would focus on providing space that permits elephants to be elephants, minimising their contact with people.”BBC’s Paradise Gardens, in which Monty Don rode an elephant, was taken off air last year amid cruelty claims.The Mirror found footage of animals being beaten where Monty’s ride was filmed.And Martin Clunes was\u2028dropped as a patron of Born Free after being filmed on an elephant for another ITV show."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles pal posts cryptic","story":"NewsMeghan Markles pal posts cryptic Insta post day before christening - then deletes itMeghan Markles friend Jessica Mulroney took to Instagram ahead of Archies christening with an intriguing messageShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUL News\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Meghan Markleaposs best friend - the favourite to become baby Archieaposs godmother - today posted a cryptic message on Instagram .Jessica Mulroney deleted her post after just  minutes but itaposs left fans speculating as to what she meant.

A term popularised in  during a keynote speech delivered by ex-Prime Minister, David Cameron, the aposage of austerityapos was coined to highlight attempts to curtail government spend and stabilise the economy following the recession. But a decade on - following closures of many publicly-funded initiatives such as libraries, museums and leisure centres - many are still looking after the pennies so the pounds look after themselves. In fact,  per cent are looking for ways to reduce their spending on a daily basis. Shopping in the reduced section, using price comparison sites and withdrawing cash so you can track your spending were among the top ways the nation is keeping a close eye on the purse strings. And seven in  will search the web for discount codes to make ‘luxuries’ more affordable, including treats like spa days, meals out or trips away from home. Buying non-branded foods such as ketchup or beans, making a coffee at home instead of buying one and travelling ‘off-peak’ are other ways Brits are reducing their outgoings.  The study by Microsoft Rewards, the rewards program from Bing, found more than a quarter of people think they have more disposable income now than  years ago, with  per cent putting this down to there being more ways to save money nowadays. Behavioural psychologist, Emma Kenny said, “It appears that in modern consumer society, customers are demanding better deals when making the majority of their purchases. “The positive emotional connection and reward that customers receive after discovering a discount reinforces subsequent shopping behaviour and is a powerful motivator in ing custom. “Undoubtedly, the average consumer no longer feels constrained by the price tags they are presented with and they are happy to spend time online and in the physical world searching for discounts and vouchers meaning their money goes further. “The savvy shopper is fast becoming the largest consumer demographic.”  The study of , adults also found  per cent think they get a better deal online, with the average adult hunting for discount codes online more than once a week.

A ruthless Polish Roma gypsy crime family trafficked hundreds of desperate and vulnerable people while leading lavish lestyles which included a luxury Bentley car. The victims were lured from Poland to Birmingham on the pretense of well-paid jobs and better lives - but many earned just £ a week as the gang stole most of their wages. They would be beaten or threatened by enforcersthey complained, with some revealing their were told they would have to dig their own graves, BirminghamLive reports. One victim has permanently lost the use of his arm after he injured his elbow at work and the gang wouldnapost let him to go to hospital.    A woman was told she would be forced into prostitutionshe continued to complain. When one victim died at a home in Birmingham, gang ringleader Justyna Parczewska, , demanded his ID and personal belongings be taken out of his pockets in a bid to prevent paramedics from identying him and to hide their crimes. Eight members of the UKaposs biggest ever nodern slavery ring have been jailed after two trials at Birmingham Crown Court.    The victims - including rough sleepers, alcoholics, drug addicts and people with mental health issues - lived in horric conditions in West Bromwich, Sandwell, Smethwick and Walsall. They slept four to a room with no beds or bedding in mouse-infested houses. Some slept on used mattresses they had found abandoned in the street. Many of the homes had broken toilets and no flushing water, and one group was forced to wash with water from a nearby canal. The slaves would be moved from house to house at shirt notice, leaving them disorientated.  They were kept in  properties and most spoke no English and had never travelled outside of Poland before. Recruiters were sent to Poland, where they found victims who had just been released from prison, were in a desperate financial situation or were outside homeless shelters or off-licences, the court heard. Some needed cash to pay for medical bills for children, partners or parents. The recruiters ed to the UK with hundreds of people aged from  to their early s - many of them arriving on coaches at the gangaposs base in West Bromwich.  West Midlands Police managed to crack the human trafficking ring thanks to the Hope for Justice anti-slavery charity, which had encouraged the terried and traumatised victims to speak to detectives. More than  victims gave evidence or statements during a five-month trial. Many have since ed home to Poland, and some have stayed in the UK. Parczewska was jailed for eight years, and her husband Ignacy Brzezinski, , was sentenced in his absence after going on the run during the trial. Their home was used as a based for the slavery operation which stole the victimsapos identities and committed financial fraud.  Top news stories from     An expensive Bentley car, linked to Brzezinski, was found at the home. Relative Marek Brzezinski, who was jailed for nine years, brought many of the Polish nationals over in his own car. The Brzezinskis were on benefits but detectives discovered that they had wired money to Poland. Warsaw-born Marek Chowanic, , from Walsall, was jailed for  years, and his partner Natalia Zmuda, , was sentenced to four years and six months for her role. Extremely psychologically manipulative Chowanic had forced the victims to open bank accounts which were then controlled by the gang.  Zmuda stole wages from bank accounts she controlled, and took the victims to job centre appointments for national insurance numbers. Juliana Chodakowicz, who used her position as an account manager at Worcestershire recruitment agency E-response to get jobs for the victims, was jailed for seven years. Unsuspecting and gullible bosses had praised Chodakowicz, who lived in Evesham and was originally from Grudziadz in Poland, for her work in finding labourers for their firms. She had mocked the desperate victims in text messages with other gang members. After being forced to set up bank accounts, the victims were made to work at farms or in manual labour with employment agencies.

The financial exploitation of the victims totalled £,, but £million could be added to that figurethe labourersapos wages and bank accounts were included, the court heard. Gang members Wojciech Nowakowski, , and Jan Sadowski, , met new arrivals and took them to open bank accounts, claim benefits and register with employment agencies. Gang enforcer Nowakowski battered victims and was feared. Police are still trying to find other members of the gang.  Detectives launched an investigation after many of the often starving victims turned to Hope for Justice for food and further help. Ignacy Brzezinski and Nowakowski were convicted of conspiracy to traffic people, requiring them to perform forced labour and acquiring criminal property. Sadowski admitted the same charges. The other five gang members were convicted of the same offences on February  but reporting restrictions prevented them being named until now. A judge praised the “meticulous detective work” of police, who analysed , lines of telephone data,  bank accounts, more than , exhibits and , witness statements.  Police had obtained ten interim Slavery  Trafficking Risk Ordersagainst the gang. Nowakowski and Ignacy Brzezinski breached the conditions and were the first people in the UK to be jailed using STRO legislation. They were jailed for  and  months respectively. After the trial, Detective Chief Inspector Nick Dale, head of West Midlands Police’s Gangs and Organised Crime Unit, said the gang members showed no remorse. He added: “The defendants sat in court listening to evidence and there was no recognition of what they had done or contrition. “They were exploiting anything up to  people in that community at any one time. The evidence of the victims was extremely impactive.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family takes wrong man life","story":"NewsFamily takes wrong man off le support in horror case of mistaken identityAfter Alfonso Bennett was taken off le support the real Alfonso showed up at a barbecue leaving authorities wondering who had just diedShareByTalia Shadwell:,  JUL NewsAuthorities later realised the man whose le support was switched off was actually Elisha Brittman \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hospital in the US is accused of switching off the wrong manaposs le support after getting consent from the family of a man who turned out to still be alive and well.

Now the relatives of that man, Elisha Brittman- and the family of Mr Bennett - are both suing Mercy Hospital in Chicago, Illinois over the mix-up. According to the BBC, the issue began after a man was found in the city in April lying naked and unconscious underneath a car with facial injuries. He was taken to the hospital as an unidentied aposJohn Doe,apos where Chicago police identied him using mug shots as Mr Bennett.  The following month the hospital made contact with relatives, and his siblings showed up - later claiming they expressed doubts at the time the severely facially wounded man was their brother. However they agreed to switch off the le support. But as his family were arranging a funeral, the real Mr Bennett showed up at a barbecue after a period away - his whereabouts unclear. The police reportedly fingerprinted the deceased man at the morgue, only to find he was actually Elisha Brittman, .    When his family called, they said he had been missing for some time and they had called hospitals and morgues everywhere in hopes of finding him. Both families are now reportedly suing the hospital and the city of Chicago for negligence and inflicting intentional emotional distress.

She said: I attribute my success to my perseverance, believing in myself  percent, my creativity, the way I treat others who I work with, and never taking failure to heart.    Abigail didnapost plan to become a model but after her first accidental photoshoot she was inundated with offers to work with brands and started making her fortune. She said: I started building my following after that and once I realised I could make a lot of money through working with brands, selling merch etc, I was hooked. Soon magazines including Esquire, Maxim, Playboy and Sports Illustrated wanted to photograph her. The small town girl, originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania and from a family of seven, moved to LA in  to develop her career. She appeared on several covers and got work on TV shows on TMZ and E!

But it isnapost all easy - it can take Abigail two hous to get ready for a shoot.    She said: Definitely make a blueprint of what you want to do. Make a big vision board of all the huge goals you wish to achieve, then break them down into smaller ones. I have whiteboards everywhere in my house. I write out my goals for each month career wise, personal wise, things I want to work on within myself in order to grow and be the best version of myself I can be.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Training up more drone pilots means the Mountain Rescue service now has greater capacity to assist in rescues all over Scotland.Drones are increasingly used in searches for people missing in the mountains but the service is also looking at innovations, such as using them as communication hubs in areas where therersquos poor or no signals.Dave Wright, Team Leader at Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue, said: ldquoAs a volunteer service the Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue team are totally reliant on the support of both the iniduals who give up their time but also to companies like Openreach who support volunteering.ldquoWithout the dedication of our volunteers and the backing of their employers we would not be able to provide this vital emergency service in our community.Openreach is one of the UKrsquos biggest employers of veterans and reservists, with around , in total and more than , ex-service personnel recruited since .It has nearly  active reservists, around  of whom are also part of the British Armyrsquos  Signal Squadron."},{"url":null,"title":"wake-me-up-before-you-go-go-to-hawick","story":"FANS of George Michael and Wham! are in for a treat next week.The George Michael Story is coming to Hawick Town Hall.With a live band and video screens supporting the show, including video footage of George and interviews with the man himself, The George Michael Story starts with George in the Wham! days in the early s and moves onto the Grammy Award-winning Faith -

Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy

planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring.

I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety. We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

Dont politicians always over-promise, throw money at the voters, spend astheres no tomorrow  Well, no actually they donrsquot ndash especially not Conservatives. You dont have to go back to the fiscally dry-as-dust Thatcher era to hear the mantra: ldquoonly spend what we can afford. The former Labour Chancellor, Gordon Brown, worshipped a god called ldquoprudence in the s, believing that Labour had lost successive elections because it couldnt be trusted with the purse strings of government.In  the Tories formed a government with the Liberal Democrats, which pledged to restore the nations finances by the most radical cost-cutting. It was called ldquoausterity\". George Osbornes programme was compared to the ldquoGeddes Axe ndash the eye-watering spending cuts imposed by the coalition Chancellor, Sir Eric Geddes, in .:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyIts worth reminding Jo Swinson, as she bids to be the next LibDem leader, that the Liberal Democrats endorsed Osbornes austerity. Indeed, Vince Cable, still says that austerity was ldquonecessary\".No one  seems to be saying that. There has been a seismic sht in the politics of public finance as politicians have suddenly abandoned the old language of fiscal rectitude. And not just in Britain. President Macron of France has had to reverse his public finance reforms. Donald Trump, despite all his rhetoric, has just put forward a record . trillion budget.What seems to have happened is that politicians of left and right, but most strikingly of the right, have become influenced by the rise of the populists. Populism is often wrongly regarded as a traditional conservative ideology boosted by anti-immigration nativism. This is a mistake. Asand YouGovs six-month study of the phenomenon pointed out, populists are much more left than conventional right, and generally seek to reduce inequality.ldquoThis is not something we expected to see, said Kirk Hawkins of . ldquoPopulism, in the end, is attractive because it takes seriously the grievances of people who feel abandoned and unfairly treated. In the crucible of Brexit, the traditional party of the right has realised that it must do something to address these grievances, or cease to exist as a political force.Im not suggesting that populists are the New Left. Only a fool would believe the promises being made on public spending. Donald Trumps spending splurge has largely been on defence and building a border wall. But the change in the ideological agenda is too striking to ignore.Jeremy Corbyns  Labour Manesto emerges, in retrospect, as relatively modest in its spending proposals. The SNP under Nicola Sturgeon is also beginning to look a little, er, conservative in its approach to public finances.As the former SNP MP George Kerevan pointed out, the SNPs Sustainable Growth Commission report, with its plans to hold spending to % below GDP, has many similarities with the austerity programme of George Osborne after . At the very least, the SGC represents a covenant with the Scottish electorate that an independent Scottish Government would only spend within its means and would not indulge in radical deficit financing.Tell that to the Tories! Theyve discovered the magic money tree. They seem to be adopting the left wing economics of Modern Monetary Theory, which says that public spending deficits dont matter because governments can always print money.Of course, this is all in the context of Brexit. We are in an age of febrile politics. There will be a reckoning.

Scuttlebutt insists that the -year-old is nothing but a puppet, leaning on colleagues for support, mouthing their ideas, and too decrepit to do much more than clutch the lectern and issue an occasional rallying call to his troops.With most unfrail alacrity, Mr Corbyn has refuted all these suggestions ndash apparently made by senior civil servants ndash and is asking for an independent inquiry into whoever is spreading such lies. He is right to insist on this, but sadly the damage is already done. Now every blink and tremor, every hesitation and stumble, will be cause for analysis and concern.No-one beyond the Labour leaderrsquos closest family and associates can know how much,any, truth this gossip holds. Wersquove been told about eye problems, but are they an indication of more serious underlying health problems  Or is it simply that the burdens of office are exhausting him, making him appear older than his years  Impossible to tell. With a man whose demeanour has always been more energy-saving bulb than dynamo, it is dficult to detect any appreciable dimming of wattage.As questions were being asked about his ability to run the party, let alone turn the key in the door of Number , I found myself thinking of Mr Corbyn when watching democratic hopefuls for the next US presidential nomination. Bernie Saunders, who will be  in September, is impressively impassioned, but he cannot surely be anybodyrsquos idea of the perfect candidate, given the demands that would be made of him in arguably the most high-profile and pressured job in the world. Joe Biden, too, at  is scarcely a spring chicken. Like Mr Saunders, he was born while the Second World War was getting into gear. As for the American president, even his worst enemies have to concede that at  he still seems to be possessed of enough energy to make international deals and travel the globe, with never a sign of flagging.This might all sound unpleasantly ageist. Yet with a few notable exceptions, most mortals begin to slow down intellectually as well as physically as they reach their biblical span of three score years and . This is not to say that there are not many fruitful, useful and enjoyable years ahead, but it is to suggest that the gruelling schedules expected of modern politicians, be they first ministers or presidents, senators or MPs, is no longer an arena in which those past their prime will easily flourish. A century ago, there would have been little or no public outcry over an elderly or enfeebled prime minister or party leadercolleagues could keep the government on track. In this, Britain had the benefit of centuries of precedent with royalty. From before the Stuarts to George III, kings and queens, with a little help from friends at court, continued to pass edicts and legislation, sign death warrants and go to war, while, whether through ill health, insanity or senility, they were completely unfit for office.Read more: Labour demands probe into civil serviceWith the onward march of democracy, however, has come greater visibility, transparency and accountability. Technology might have transformed our domestic workload, but for those in the political front line, the digital revolution has turned night into day. Dedication and accessibility   is the least voters now expect. No wonder so many images of MPs shows them in running gear, pounding the pavements and turning strawberry pink. This is not just a metaphor but a practical necessitythey are to survive the punishing regime their role demands.Despite much talk about our fast-ageing population, there has never been a period that is so youth-driven, or when the old have been so easily and cruelly dismissed as irrelevant or past-it because they have one foot still in a pre-tech world. The gulf between those born while ration books were circulating, and those whorsquod mastered an iPhone before their milk teeth were cut, is eye-wateringly wide. What does someone of pensionable age understand of the Snapchat generation  Other than the most basic human needs, such as security, work, and dignity, which transcend any barriers of time and class, colour and creed, what can an elderly politician offer a youthful electorate Well, perhaps more than yoursquod think. Clearly, what wersquore witnessing with the ongoing popularity of those like Mr Saunders and Donald Trump, is the triumph of longevity and experience over vigour. Their retro appeal is in part thanks to a letimersquos accumulation of high-powered connections and skills. Why be surprised that some dream even now of Ken Clarke taking over the Tory Party to bring it to its senses, despite him being almost as ancient as the Fortingall yew  Or that others rejoice at the distant prospect of Ann Widdecombe resurrecting her political career and ing as a Brexit Party MP.Experience, and the informed perspective it allows, is by far the greatest advantage of seniority. Is this what the young see when they look at people like Mr Corbyn, who lavishes more care on his allotment than on clear-cut policy yet commands widespread respect and even affection or why the venerable-looking Mr Saunders made such an impression with his brand of democractic socialism that he threatened to make Hillary Clinton toast It would seem so. Evidence suggests, indeed, that despite living in a world designed for youth, where to be in any way incapacitated or slow is to be invisible and ignored, we are nevertheless hard-wired as humans to defer to age. Rightly or wrongly, our instincts tell us that with wrinkles or bald pate, dentures or dodgy knees, comes hard-won wisdom.

They could kill millions. That is why their opponents do not like them. And it also is why their supporters say they serve as a deterrent.Yet, writing in todayrsquos Herald, St Andrews University expert Phillips OrsquoBrien stresses these weapon systems, however dangerous, however complex, have always been more ldquopolitical than practical.And Mr OrsquoBrien reckons that political role could be more important than ever. As Britain crashes out of the European Union, in a drawn-out squabble with nations that were once its closest military allies and trading partners, it will need a symbol of military virility.Few, however, quibble over the personal contributions of submariners, men who spend weeks away from their homes and families, sacricing privacy on cramped ldquoboats. Most never even know where they are when at sea. The danger of the work was underlined this week when a fire was reported to have killed sailors on a secret submersible in Russia.:What next for Britainrsquos undersea bombers Inspired by the warplanes of another age, the navy tends to think of the big ballistic missile subs as ldquobombers and of the nuclear-powered but not nuclear-armed hunter-killers as ldquofighters. Both types of boat are now based at Faslane, which is becoming Britainrsquos only base for underwater vessels.A vanguard-class Trident submarineBack in April, when he announced events to commemorate  years of CASD, the then defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, told the House of Commons: ldquoHalf a century ago, HMS Resolution glided into the Clyde and sailed into the history books.ldquoThat was the start of our longest sustained military operation ndash Operation Relentless ndash and the beginning of our continuous at-sea deterrent.ldquoSince then, there has always been a Royal Navy ballistic missile submarine at sea protecting our nation, and thousands of submariners have followed in the wake of Resolutionrsquos crew conducting vital work, unseen and undetected, every minute of every day.ldquoWe already honour our submariners with a deterrent patrol pin ndash often known as the bomber pin ndash giving recognition to their enormous efforts, but we want to go further still. Consequently, we are going to ensure that those who complete  patrols will now be recognised with the new silver bomber pin.ldquoFuture bomber pins will be made from metal taken from HMS Resolution, linking todayrsquos submariners with their forefathers and emphasising the longevity and the signicance of the -year mission.Respect for submariners does not mean the opponents of CASD will be celebrating ndash or even appreciating Mr Williamsonrsquos gesture.

The existing fleet is getting older and the next generation of \"bombers\" - Dreadnought classes - are still a long way from delivery.:What next for Britainrsquos undersea bombers That worries Professor Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director of the Royal United Services Institite. Keeping a deterrent active at all times, he stressed, is far from easy and far from guaranteed.Prof Chalmers said: \"This is a remarkable operational achievement only made possible by the dedication and sacrice of tens of thousands of people - both onshore and at sea - who have kept the fleet going.\"The criterion of keeping a boat on patrol at all times is a challenging one, and is made steadily more so as the submarines get older. Further delays in bringing the new Dreadnought submarines into service, therefore, could bring the Royal Navys ability to deploy continuously into question.\"Faslane, which dates to the Second World War, expanded into an old breakerrsquos yard on the Gare Loch, to house Polaris after the US system was bought from America in the s. The UK had separately developed its own A-bomb a decade before ndash but these were designed to be dropped from planes.Protests against Polaris missiles in Mark Ruskell, Scottish Green MSP and anti-nuclear activist, stressed that Clyde base had become a focal point for protest, galvanising Scots to oppose such weapons and even the political union which brought them north of the Border.He said: ldquoFaslane is a constant reminder that we are only minutes away from mutually assured destruction. Itrsquos become a brutal symbol and gathering point for the green and peace movements over the decades, but there is always a fresh sense of disbelief whenever I visit ndash just how can these vast, immoral weapons still play any strategic security role today ldquoIn a world increasingly ided by climate change and information wars, the risks from nuclear weapons have only intensied in recent years as nuclear states like the UK drive forward modernisation programmes. ldquoIrsquoll never stop campaigning against nukes, itrsquos part of the green movementrsquos DNA .:What next for Britainrsquos undersea bombers The Faslane base, HMNB ClydeLabour MSP Jackie Baillie - whose Dumbarton constituency includes Helensburgh and the Gare Loch - stressed how touch it was to serve underwater.She said:ldquoIn the th anniversary of the nuclear deterrent being based at Faslane, I want to pay tribute to all those who have served in the navy and in particular our submariners.\"The le of a submariner is not easy, separated from family for months on end living in the most cramped conditions imaginable.

Legend has it that he provided a home to Thenew, a princess of the Britons, when she was disowned by her family after falling pregnant out of wedlock.The child she bore would grow up to become St Kentigern ndash affectionately known as Mungo by St Serf ndash who established his own community in the land which would one day become Glasgow and remains the cityrsquos patron saint.His mother is remembered as St Enoch.Dunfermline Abbey is one of the sightsFrom this start, the path is peppered with historical and religious sites.Along the way it visits Dunfermline Abbey, the centre of Christian le in the area for more than , years, and the proud St Drostanrsquos Tower in Markinch, parts of which date to the th century and would have been a welcome site to walkers heading west.Overall, there are more than  sites of interest along the trail, including stone circles, battlefields, country mansions and examples of Fersquos long industrial heritage.The Way moves resolutely inland after a few miles on the coast, and has been knitted together from new and existing paths and through agreements with local landowners and communities to form an unbroken chain crossing the Kingdom.Walkers are guided by hundreds of posts marked with the Fe Pilgrim Way sign, and wayposts giving the number of miles to go to the next stage.:How Skye figures twice on Airbnbs top  Scottish destinations listIt is estimated to take six daysrsquo moderate walking, but hikers are also encouraged to try sections at a time.A new website, a walking map, a Pilgrims Passport ndash which lets walkers tick off the stages they have completedndash rest points and a smartphone app have also all been made available to help modern-day pilgrims on their way.It is hoped that, as well as attracting local walking groups, it will open up a previously unseen part of Scotland to visitors from the UK and overseas.Lord Thurso, VisitScotland chairman, said: ldquoScotland is renowned as a tourism destination with excellent walking trails and long-distance routes.ldquoThis is reflected by over .m domestic visitor trips to Scotland featuring walking.

Scottish whisky has an in-built, natural and nostalgic advantage over its competitors but we cannot get complacent there are markets that must be seized in South America and Asia.ldquoIf we deliver a good Brexit deal and follow it with the right trade deals, we can continue the Scottish whisky boom,\" adds Mr Hunt.As well as the Scottish hustings in Perth tonight, the ballot papers also go out today. As it is widely believed that most of the , or so Tory members will vote quickly, this in all practicality means the contest could be over this weekend with more than two weeks still to go before ballots close on July .Yesterday, Mr Hunt changed tack after he initially said he would allow a Commons vote on fox-hunting in which he would back its restitution in England and Wales.Later, however, he stressed: \"But it wouldnt be my priority as Prime Minister. Were going to have Brexit, weve the social care system...weve got huge economic priorities that are going to have to be addressed so that wouldnt be where Id focus my energies.\"During a campaign visit in Yorkshire, Mr Johnson side-stepped the fox-hunting issue, saying his priority was to ldquoget Brexit done on October , to do everything I can to unite our countryhellipand then get our party ready to defeat Jeremy Corbyn.\"On social care south of the border, Mr Hunt set out a four-point plan, which would be explained in detail in a Green Paper to be published in his first  days in office. This would include a -year funding plan aligned with the -year plan he negotiated for the NHS, including additional state funding for local councils from the pound billion of fiscal headroom available.On the stump in Yorkshire, Mr Johnson said he too would immediately start work on social care reforms and set out two key principles, which were ldquono-one should face eviction from their home to pay for the cost of their care and everybodys got to have dignity and security in old age.Last night, at hustings in the county, the former London Mayor said he too would put the Union before Brexit but argued no Scottish voter would be able to support a UK government that did not push through Brexit after being asked to in the  referendum.

An abuse of power and negligence in another light. Itrsquos depressing how often Irsquove mentioned that anecdote to people and received the response, ldquoFair enough. They shouldnrsquot be having babiesthey canrsquot pay for them care for them.Already running successfully in England and Northern Ireland, the project offers intensive support to women who have had multiple children ndash on average three to four and in one case  ndash removed from their care, offering intensive practical, therapeutic and behavioural support.Such support, though, comes with one condition: the women agree to use long acting contraceptivessuch as the implant, injection or coil. A woman who becomes pregnant will be ldquophased out of the programme.Medical interventions such as these, of course, come with possible physical side effects, but the specialists behind the scheme insist a ldquopause from pregnancy is necessary for the women to, as chief social worker Jane Martin put it, ldquouse their time on the programme to effectively tackle destructive patterns, develop new skills and avoid further trauma.It is a bereavement but not widely recognised as such, particularly with the additional trauma of blame, guilt and sense of failure or injustice that can accompany the loss of the child.When a child is at home, often services are tailored to support and find the best outcome for the child or young person with lesser emphasis on the mother. With the Pause Programme, by removing the child from the equation, the focus becomes purely on the woman and what is best for her.This is almost, in itself, controversial, given how much store society sets on the ability of women to be an effective mother, and how ndash rightly ndash child-centric Scottish policy has become, with additional childcare hours, the Scottish Child Payment, the baby box, and the First Ministerrsquos commitment to care-experienced young people.But when the most intensive and high quality support comes with a serious caveat, is that really a choice and is it an ethical choice to offer  Particularly to women from a social strata where bodily and reproductive autonomy is in question in a way that it would never be for the middle classes. Think the two-child cap for Child Tax Credit and Universal Credit.Particularly when the cash savings of the Pause Programme are not easily overlooked: a briefing from Dundee Council suggested thatthe scheme meant the prevention of between six and ten pregnancies that would avoid between pound, and pound. million over five years.The scheme works on a hypothetical. That being hard to reach, women living chaotic lives will not be able to turn their lives around without the removal of additional babies from the equation.It also works on the hypothetical that this pregnancy pause is best for any future children but is that not then saying it would be better not to be born than to be born and be care-experienced Womenrsquos reproductive rights are perpetually under siege. Women in Northern Ireland still do not have access to abortion on an equal footing with their peers in the rest of the UK while abortion is a topic of routine political scrutiny and debate. When women are happily pregnant, society polices what they might eat, drink and participate in by using judgement as a form of control.In America we see Gilead levels of state control over womenrsquos bodies. The recent arrest and then, on Wednesday this week, dropping of charges against Marshae Jones, in Alabama, shows the importance of vigilance. Ms Jones was shot in the stomach but was arrested for manslaughter for initiating a fight, knowing she was pregnant.It may seem a stretch from the appalling strictures of the Yellowhammer State, but any policy that conflicts with womenrsquos reproductive rights must come under close scrutiny. In the case of the Pause Programme, there is a contradiction, in that, by focusing solely on a womanrsquos needs as a person and not as a mother, the programme also removes her autonomy in choosing pregnancy or not.ldquoThere have been trials already in parts of England, Stewart Hunter, convener for Dundee City Councilrsquos children and families services, said, ldquoAnd the feedback from women there has been fairly positive so thatrsquos comforting.We do not live in a political climate where ldquofairly positive is ethically sound enough to justy pausing a womanrsquos right to choose."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-unionists-blame-rise-snp","story":"At Westminster, Conservatives have a dismal  MPs out of , with the SNP having , nearly three times that number.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmThe  NatWest International Island Games will formally open tomorrow, marking the start of the th Games.

Asbestos only poses a health riskdisturbed.You should never carry out major building, maintenance or demolition work on materials that you know or suspect contains asbestos, instead contacting a licenced contractor who can arrange to get the asbestos removed for you.If you only plan to carry out minor work on asbestos containing materials, such as drilling holes for fixtures and fittings, repainting a ceiling or applying new plasterboard, you can do so provided that you’re appropriately trained and know how to assess the risks and work safely.Jonathan Walters OIC environmental services facilities manager said: #From time to time householders may need to dispose of what#s known as hazardous waste # whether that be asbestos, chemical or clinical waste.#We need to ensure that this waste is disposed of properly and safely so additional rules are in place. Full details of these are available on the Council website http:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory R hazardous-waste-materials.htm and also through SEPA.#Where householders don#t stick to these rules, it can cause major disruption at our sites — as we can see with this incident. It also leads to contamination of some our recyclates meaning they can’t be sold on or  used where – thereby reducing valuable income and adding additional cost burdens to the Council.#If you witness misuse at any of the Recycling Centres please do not hesitate to contact the Council to advise and help us to minimise any disruption to our services to the public.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But when we think of summer, in the most idyllic sense, our heads fill with colour and warmth. Hazy, dfused circles of heat creeping over snapshots of times past moments of action frozen in time. I don’t want mundane days I want everything in summer to be as full and vibrant as ripe fruit, evenit’s just the extravagant laziness of doing nothing at all to the fullest possible extent.The quintessential summer, in my own mind’s eye, takes the form of one specic picture: sitting on my grandparent’s front steps, eating an ice pole, while the neighbour downstairs gardened and I picked paint off the railing to look at layers of colour underneath. A warm day with the flowers blooming, blue skies and distant lawnmowers, the sweetness in the air of my nana’s roses, suspended in time forever. When my mind wanders, thinking of summer, that moment is always there. I cycle through other scenes: the intention,not necessarily weather-permitting reality, of beer gardens. My papa packing a flask of tea before a day out in the car. Touching the chilly North Sea as a wave comes in. Lying on my back reading, while there’s a breeze blowing in and nothing to do: in a caravan, with the door open and gas stove hiss of tea being made, or rain pattering on the roof. Sometimes I think about being suspended on a plane, with nothing to do but waste away time with a book before stepping out into unfamiliar humidity.: The indignity of modern train travel – Laura Waddell: Fleabag: Priest’s sexual advance has got people talking – Laura WaddellNostalgia is the ultimate Instagram filter, but hope is close behind. When we daydream of the summer we want, we’re not thinking of nothing at all, but of a clearly defined atmosphere, one we want to plunge entirely into, dferent from our everyday lives rather than merely undoing them. Temporarily, we enter alternate reality, whether through memories or hope for how our summer might look. The city itself looks dferent in the sunshine. We rediscover gardens and parks. New ways of being are possible. I walk around looser in my skin, later into the day. We don’t want to drop out of reality entirely – other than a break from everyday chores, tedium, or anxiety – so much as we want to e headfirst into glorious feeling. Sights and sounds, cut crass, chilled wine, and sunshine langour. Summer is intense, in the way that the orange of Aperol spritzes is intense, the smell of lavender is intense, and heat on our brow is intense. Deeper sleeps, longer lies.It’s rarely so idyllic, all of the time. But the best stories, of course, also temporarily take us out of reality and set us down where. And so they are, I feel, the ideal summer reads – like for like. There are some practical considerations. Physically, you’ll probably want a paperback that can be chucked in beach bags or shoved down into a backpack alongside bug spray, water bottles, sandwiches and sunscreen. Books are made for using even an object fetishist like me, who spends a lot of time looking at book cover design, still batters their corners.If I’m travelling I might seek out something set in the destination ahead to double up on discovery. This year, ahead of a pinching-myself lucky work invitation to Vienna to celebrate Bloomsday – books have enabled me to travel to new places, literally as well as figuratively – I dipped back into Austrian author Stefan Zweig’s shorter stories, full of emotion, which often depict longing in settings such as hotel rooms and train stations, reflective of his status as a Jewish intellectual dispersed during the Second World War. His experiences have never felt irrelevant, and his storytelling skills are classic. As I work in the book industry, for summer reading I often choose books I don’t have to review, write about, or recommend in any way. No publication dates looming. A dissolution of everyday demands. It’s a rare, weightless chance to browse shelves without looking for anything in particular, although inevitably, I’ll weigh myself down from trips to bookshops wherever I go.Recently I did an author reading in Shakespeare and Co, the revered, ramshackle, cat-installed English language bookshop in Paris, celebrating the launch of an anthology called We’ll Never Have Paris which invited a sprawling number of writers to depict it as they see fit a theme that emerges is reconciling the Paris of romanticised imagination with the everyday reality. While I was there, I pluckedLauren Groff’s Fates and Furies from a high and tightly packed shelf, a bestseller from a couple of years ago that I’d been meaning to read for ages. It’s a dense and lyrical book exploring one marriage’s successes, sacrices, and hidden rages. While keeping cool from the record-breaking heatwave sweeping Europe, I also read Heartburn by Nora Ephron, a short, sharp satire of eighties New York and Washington society full of wit, humour, and recipes, and Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miriwhich shows the city from a rare perspective, that of a homeless labourer asking himself whether years of gruelling work building Olympic stadiums had been worthwhile, capturing the everyday atmosphere of transient camps.In the summer, with more time to wander and get lost, I gravitate towards books that will immerse me in their world some of the very best hazy-dayed reading memories I have include plunging into Donna Tartt’s addictive New England intrigues, Elena Ferrante’s two fists full Napoleon epic that took me through all seasons, and Samanta Schweblin’s eerie Argentinian bio-horror Fever Dream.Each to their own, of course. Wholeheartedly, I believe anyone should read whatever they want, should they choose. But for me, summertime reading will always be something I can travel through, as much as with, taking me to places I don’t yet know or deepening my imagining of those I do, but crucially, upending reality just like a strike of sunlight washing over my face is able to.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow based kilt company to launch world s first vegan tartan","story":"Woven only in animal-free materials, the kilt is designed to celebrate those Scots and tartan enthusiasts from around the world that follow a vegan lestyle.

Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

Sean McAleese, Training Manager at Northern Regional College, said they are thrilled that the hard work and talent of so many of their apprentices are being recognised at these awards.“We have worked closely with local employers over many years to ensure we are equipping our students with industry-level skills, and these invaluable relationships help us to ensure our students receive training at the very highest level,” he said.Apprentice of the Year Calum, who is currently enrolled on a Level  electrical installation programme, said he always wanted to be an electrician.“I’ve always tried, both in College and on-site, to achieve the very highest standards, in everything I do,” said Calum. “It’s great to have all that hard work and effort recognised with an award like this one.”Jordan Haggan, , said from the outset of his career he spent a lot of time working alongside electricians.“But it took me a while to make the leap of faith and pursue it as a career myself.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"balmoral master chef provides boost for guide dogs ni","story":"WITH entries for the Balmoral Hotel’s Master*Chef compet-ition drawing to a close on Friday, the competition to find Ireland’s next top chef could also have a positive lasting impact on the work of its charity partner, Guide Dogs NI.Through their efforts, Guide Dogs NI help change the way sight loss affects people’s lives by ensuring that they can get out and about on their own terms. This involves tireless campaigning, fundraising, and, of course, as Guide Dogs NI Engagement Officer, Hannah Lyons explains, the support of iniduals and businesses such as the Balmoral Hotel on the Blacks Road.“It’s wonderful that the Balmoral Hotel have chosen us as their charity partners,” she says.“We are really excited for the upcoming Master*Chef. Fundraising is integral to all of the work that we do. It costs around £, to support a guide dog from birth to retirement. We cover their whole working le as a guide dog including the cost of their food and ongoing training. “Guide dogs are le changing, but there is a lot of work involved in it, so it is essential to have the support from iniduals or organisations like the Balmoral.”As well as raising funds, the Master*Chef competition will also help raise awareness of the work Guide Dogs NI do and inform people of some of struggles faced by the visually impaired.“Our ambition is for a future where everybody with sight loss has the confidence and support to live their lives to the full,” Hannah explains. “A big part of it is access to and experience of services such as shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. We talk about the ‘purple pound’, which is the spending power of anybody living with a disability. We always say that it shouldn’t be underestimated. If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-02-at-11.22.45.png","title":"meet aaron flanagan","story":"In , Aaron Flanagan and his brother quit their ‘proper jobs’ to open Comic Book Guys, Northern Ireland#s largest independent comic book store and the first-ever authorised CGC dealer.The one-stop shop located on Great VIctoria Street has been serving Belfast’s thriving comic book scene through golden, silver age, bronze to modern comics, movie memorabilia, toys, collectables and even comics made by local creators .In this week’s conversation, we chat all about serving a small market, the impact superhero movies have had on the industry, what it’s like to set up your own business and why a vintage medium like comic books are still thriving today.Check it out.

She said justice must always remain open to victims of terrorism and those who carry it out should not be able \"to stop looking over their shoulder\".\"Whilst the opinions have now been garnered, the challenge is finding a way forward which ensures that history is not rewritten and those who took innocent le are held accountable rather than the reputation of those who stood against terrorism being inaccurately tarnished,\" she said.\"When Gerry Adams told the funeral of Kevin McKenna that the part played by McKenna and others like him will never be known, it once again reinforces the view that the IRA has no intention of ever telling the truth about the past.  \"Whilst they demand the truth from soldiers and police officers, they hide from the truth about their dark and terrible past.”The consultation found many victims, survivors and families opposed an amnesty for Troubles matters, in addition to some veterans groups.A new independent investigation unit and a truth recovery body, which were contained in the  Stormont House Agreement , were among the mechanisms consulted on, however it is unclear whether they will now be implemented.Ulster Unionist justice spokesperson, Doug Beattie, said the summary of responses \"vindicates\" their opposition to the mechanisms agreed by Sinn Fein in the SHA.“We must be careful that we do not end up with a process which gives in to who those shout the loudest rather than seeking to do what is right, and deliver a balanced, fair, equitable and proportionate solution,\" he said.“We have previously highlighted the many flaws in the Historical Investigations Unitand we welcome the fact that many respondents recognise our concerns that a one-sided process is almost inevitable given that only the State has historical records and that re-writing of history with a focus on the role of the Police and the Army is the aim of republicans.\"Sinn Feins legacy spokesperson, Linda Dillion, said the SHA legacy mechanisms must now be implemented.“We welcome the wide support from respondents for the legacy mechanisms, support for adequate resources for the Police Ombudsman’s Office, until the HIU is up and running, and for the Lord Chief Justice’s five-year plan to tackle the backlog of legacy inquests,\" she said.\"Sinn Fein notes that the British government restates its commitment to the implementation of the structures agreed at Stormont House. What is required now is that the British government urgently sets out a time frame to bring forward legislation for the legacy structures. “Some families have been waiting almost  years on truth and justice. There can be no more stalling or protracted and unnecessary delays. The opportunity to deal with the past is now.

No-one who has done wrong should be able to stop looking over their shoulder.“Whilst the opinions have now been garnered, the challenge is finding a way forward which ensures that history is not rewritten and those who took innocent le are held accountable, rather than the reputation of those who stood against terrorism being inaccurately tarnished.”Sinn Fein said the Government must stop “stalling” on implementing the mechanisms.Linda Dillon MLA said: “What is required now is that the British Government urgently sets out a time frame to bring forward legislation for the legacy structures.Dillon welcomes legacy consultation responses – ‘Now’s the time to deal with the past’ @LindaDillon pic YQbtIl— Sinn FéinJuly , “Some families have been waiting almost  years on truth and justice. There can be no more stalling or protracted and unnecessary delays.“The opportunity to deal with the past is now. The time to engage with the past is now.“Any further delays or stalling from the British Government will only serve to undermine public confidence in the consultation, undermine the policy intent of the Stormont House Agreement and more worryingly, further disappoint and alienate victims.”Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie said the legacy arrangements must be “balanced, fair, equitable and proportionate”.He warned the process could not be about those who “shout the loudest get their way”.“We are not surprised that there is a lot of agreement that the present system for dealing with the past isn’t working, but that does not mean we should accept a replacement solution that is so structurally flawed,” he said.“In order to change the structural flaws, there must be a fundamental change to the SHA legacy proposals, which never enjoyed the support of the Ulster Unionist Party.”Alliance party deputy leader Stephen Farry said the publication of the consultation should be a springboard towards final agreement on the Stormont House mechanisms.On the majority rejection of amnesty, Mr Farry added: “It is rightly recognised such an approach would undermine the contribution of all of those who served and protected the community in line with the rule of law.“This stands in sharp contrast to the impression given in Westminster, which is in danger of badly skewing the debate and undermining the process.“This summary of the consultation should be used to end those destructive moves.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new psni chief simon byrne celebrates fantastic first week with vlog","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was due to attend a summer scheme at Arvalee School and Resource Centre in nearby Omagh. According to the Ulster Herald, he was left behind, strapped in the bus and only discovered when a depot worker walked past the vehicle.The boys parents were reportedly \"angry and distraught\" over the incident. The EA confirmed it was \"investigating a transport-related incident involving a pupil attending a summer scheme\". A spokesperson explained: \"The safety and the wellbeing of all pupils is the EAs primary concern.\"The outcome of the investigation will determine what additional measures may be required to ensure an incident of this nature does not happen again.\"Arvalee principal Jonathan Gray told the Belfastyesterday: \"This is a dreadful situation and one that cannot happen again. \"We must allow the EA to complete their investigation before a comment can be made. \"The school and the staff working the summer scheme will focus on supporting all children, ensuring they have a fantastic summer scheme. \"It is an awful situation when you consider what could have happened. \"I am thankful that no further harm has come .

They have been locked in talks ever since amid deep isions over how best to balance political, geographic and gender considerations among the  member nations.With the selection process bogged down for the second EU summit meeting in a row, the leaders are still considering Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans to replace Christian Democrat Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the EU’s powerful executive arm, the European Commission.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker sits prior to a round table meeting at the EU summit in Brussels “Let’s see,” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said of Mr Timmermans’s chances when briefly descending from the meeting room at EU headquarters at around breakfast time.The Timmermans option has deeply ided the European People’s Partyas it would surrender the key post to the rival Socialists and Democratsbloc despite the EPP remaining the biggest group in the EU following last month’s election.Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, an EPP stalwart, posted a video on his Facebook account of a discussion with Mr Timmermans in which Mr Borissov said the Dutchman should get the commission job while the less coveted parliament presidency should go to EPP candidate Manfred Weber.But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar insisted that the “vast majority of the EPP prime ministers don’t believe we should give up the presidency of the commission quite so easily, without a fight”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A journalist rests during the late-night negotiating session in Brussels After negotiations started early on Sunday, summit host and EU Council president Donald Tusk had more than  bilateral meetings in his attempt to find a breakthrough.The appointments must take into account political affiliation, geography – balancing east and west, north and south – population size and gender. The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backs Mr Weber, the German conservative whose centre-right EPP is the largest political group in the European Parliament but lost seats in the EU elections in May.French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Mr Weber lacks the political and government experience for such a high-profile role.Mr Weber could still be considered for the head of the European Parliament, which is the EU’s only elected institution.Mrs Merkel said there was still a good possibility for Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans, the top centre-left candidate from the SD group, to be among the winners of the top positions. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the EU summit Other leaders from the same political family disagreed.The EPP and the SD are the two biggest political groups in the EU, but both lost seats in May’s polls, where far-right and populist parties, pro-business liberals and the Greens made gains.EU leaders want to fill the positions soon because the European Parliament is set to pick a new president next Wednesday.Under EU rules, member countries choose who will run the commission, replacing Mr Juncker. The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia. Others mentioned include Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier of France, Greens leader Ska Keller of Germany, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief since .On Monday a spokesman for Mr Tusk said the summit had been suspended and would reconvene on Tuesday morning."},{"url":null,"title":"iraq celebrates babylon being named unesco world heritage site","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bravo! 👏ℹ️ https:t.co thVmwrjX #WHC pic UXSJnwDU— UNESCOJuly , Babylon, , years old and now mainly an archaeological ruin with two important museums, is where dynasties have risen and fallen since the earliest days of settled human civilisation.King Hammurabi wrote his famous code of laws in Babylon, while Nebuchadnezzar sent his vast army from the city to Jerusalem to put down an uprising and bring the Jews back as slaves.Some say Alexander the Great, who led his army out of Macedonia to conquer most of the known world, died there in  BC.Dozens of Iraqis waving their national flag gathered at the Ishtar Gate at the site celebrating their city’s new international status.Iraqi prime minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi described the vote as “another victory for the Iraq of civilisations that was and will always be a lighthouse to the world”.President Barham Saleh tweeted that after Babylon, more ancient sites would be added to the list, through which “Iraq will restore that status that it deserves”.Parliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi and minister of culture Abdul-Amir al-Hamadani congratulated the Iraqi people on the announcement.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  An Iraqi armed soldier walks in front of the Ishtar Gate of ancient Babylon The vote came years after the Islamic State group damaged another Iraq World Heritage Site in the country’s north, the ancient city of Hatra.The extremists also destroyed other sites in Iraq, including Nimrud where giant winged bulls that once stood sentry at the nearly ,-year-old palace were hacked to pieces.Along with Babylon and Hatra, Iraq has three other sites of world heritage, the archaeological city of Samarra in central Iraq, Ashur in the north and the citadel of the northern city of Erbil.Unesco said in its statement that Babylon’s “remains, outer and inner-city walls, gates, palaces and temples, are a unique testimony to one of the most influential empires of the ancient world”.“The city’s association with one of the seven wonders of the ancient world – the Hanging Gardens – has also inspired artistic, popular and religious culture on a global scale,” Unesco said."},{"url":null,"title":"279329","story":"A

to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, MPs sought more detail around a timeline for delivering City Deal projects.Labour MP Mike Amesbury, Shadow Minister for Employment, asked what comparative assessment she has made of the scope of city deals in Northern Ireland His question was answered by John Penrose MP, Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, who said: “In line with our  manesto commitment, we have already announced two city deals in Northern Ireland, £m for Belfast and a combined package of £m for Derry and Strabane.“Early stage discussions have also begun with other councils in the mid-south and west and Causeway Coast and Glens.”Addressing the House, Mr Amesbury recalled a recent visit to the “wonderful city of Derry” where he spoke with those shaping the education offer, adding, “they told me that a central aspect of the City Deal is the establishment of a riverfront university, medical centre and innovation hub.“Could the minister update the house on the timeline of progress of this much-needed facility ”He was told that the timeline of that is “the same as the timeline in the rest of the City Deal, which is that business cases have to be worked up, as business cases clearly for all the projects in it have to work well.“There are incidentally for any business cases that don’t shape up, many, many other ideas which can also be brought through and they will then get approved and will then proceed.”Before he got an opportunity to finish answering the question, The Speaker called Belfast MP Emma Little Pengelly forward who pressed him about progress on the Belfast City Deal.The DUP MP asked for detail around discussions with the head of the civil service and city council about getting those projects to implementation and when he anticipated the first project will be rolled out.“The dficulty here is that City Deals are a local initiative, we can only lay foundations but they need to be taken forward both by the local partners and local councils, but also ultimately, as soon as we get the Stormont Executive re-established they have to have a central role in this.“So, while we are making progress as fast as we decently can, and so are the local councils, we are ultimately also dependent on the progress of the talks,” Mr Penrose concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

It was particularly hot in qualying, so I was delighted to have strung a lap together to get pole position by quite a good margin.Harper knew that a good start was important and thatrsquos what he got.ldquoI knew that getting to the first corner in the lead was crucial in race one and fortunately I achieved it.ldquoFrom there, I got a two second gap quite quickly and then focused on maintaining that to the finish, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devoted couple celebrate 67th wedding anniversary  ","story":"AFTER  years of wedded bliss, Downpatrick couple Aidan and Frances Vaughan still hold hands when they watch television together.The devoted pair celebrated their latest matrimonial milestone last week with a special dinner at the Burrendale Hotel in Newcastle with their seven adult sons and daughters.Aidan, now aged  and Frances at , want to make each passing year count and ensure that their anniversary was marked.Their marriage has created an ever-growing lineage of  grandchildren and  great-grandchildren.ldquoI would do it all again tomorrow as Aidan has been a great husband and good father, said Frances.ldquoHe was always very respectful and gentlemanly and never raised his voice to me or the children.And as for Aidan, when asked what attracted him to Frances, he answered: ldquoWell, she was a very good looking girl and still is.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis.

The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women.

In addition, air source heat pumps run from the PV  to heat the building and water.Cllr Casey said one of the councilrsquos key aims was to provide high quality community facilities.ldquoThis beautul state-of-the-art building is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups, he remarked.Jerome Burns, from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairssaid: ldquoThe Departmentrsquos Rural Development Programme aims to improve the quality of le and services for those in rural communities.ldquoIt is encouraging to see the completion of this new facility which provides a state of the art community hub to allow the Saintfield Community Trust, in conjunction with the relevant bodies and agencies, to deliver a wide range of programmes to help improve the welfare and access to basic services of those living in the Saintfield area.Cllr Roisin Mulgrew, chairwoman of the RDP Local Action Group said: ldquoThe Local Action Group is delighted to have awarded a signicant investment towards the Saintfield Community Centre.ldquoThe completed facility is a fantastic example of how multiple groups and organisations can work collaboratively to provide a hub that will develop the social and physical attributes of all user groups for many years to come.ldquoThe funds provided by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Commission provides rural dwellers of Newry, Mourne and Down Council a real opportunity to gain access to a range of services.Cllr Terry Andrews, vice-chairman of the PEACE IV Partnership, remarked: ldquoThis project has been delivered under the Shared Spaces and Services theme which aims to create a more cohesive society through an increased provision of shared spaces and services.ldquoWe certainly hope that the new Saintfield Community Centre will provide a neutral, shared community space which will improve mutual understanding and build bridges between people of dferent community backgrounds.Damian Scarlett, chairman of Saintfield Community Trust, described the opening of the new centre as the beginning of a new era for the community of Saintfield.ldquoWe now have excellent facilities within our doorstep that will be a benefit to all, he said. It was a long and hard road to bring this project to a close and although I speak to you today as the chair of Saintfield Community Trust, we must pay tribute to the volunteers of the Saintfield Development Association who were the driving force for the community at the beginning.The new centre will be managed by the Saintfield Community Trust through a facility management agreement with the council..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17734336.family-adventure-at-crom/resources/images/10075525.jpg","title":"making headlines week","story":"In this weeks Impartial Reporter we have exclusive stories on historical sex abuse, Council stories, all the best in entertainment, opinion and of course sport.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Inky is now being cared for by staff and volunteers at Cats Protections Belfast Adoption Centre.Pic: cats protection.Named Inky by vets, the black -week-old kitten had suffered a complicated break to his right foreleg and his ears had also been singed.Cats Protection issued an appeal on Thursday through this newspaper for donations from the public to help pay for Inky’s operation and aftercare, expected to cost at least £..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p The charity has revealed that in just  hours “a brilliant £” has been raised and has thanked everyone who has made a donation.It also revealed that a very generous donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, has come forward to say they will double whatever total they manage to raise. Deputy Manager of Cats Protection’s Belfast Adoption Centre Andrew Doherty said: “It’s not known how poor Inky broke his leg so badly, but we think he probably burned his ears when he was hiding inside the hot car engine.“His leg was so badly damaged that, sadly, the only option was for vets to remove it. It’ll take Inky a few weeks to recover from the operation, but so far he’s taken it in his stride.“He’s a very friendly and relaxed kitten and is enjoying all the fuss and attention from volunteers and staff at the centre.“Inky isn’t yet available for rehoming, but anyone interested in offering him a new home can keep any eye out for him on our website.“He’ll be able to do most things cats do on his remaining three legs, but as he won’t be able to scale fences or escape from potential dangers as well as four-legged cats can, he’ll be looking for an indoor home.”If you’d like to help the adoption centre pay for Inky’s treatment, you can donate to the JustGiving appeal at: www.justgiving fundraising cats-protection-helpinkyAndrew said: “We’d be extremely gratefulanyone who would like to help Inky could donate to our appeal – every penny will make a huge dference and help us pay for his operation and continued aftercare.”Church call: do not force liberalised laws upon NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"As a member of the public found Inky and took him to vet in East Belfast before he came into Cats Protection’s care on Friday, June , the exact location and circumstances of where he was found aren’t known.You can find out more about the work of Cats Protection’s Belfast Adoption Centre in Belfast Road, Dundonald, at: www.cats.org.uk belfast.try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves.

I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Getting updates from my team helps me get into trouble-shooting mode.amI’m on the road a lot with work so it’s normally a flight to London or a drive to Dublin to meet broadcasters or talent. I can be down to Dublin twice a week for meetings. When I am driving I try to catch up on calls both work and personal and often have a lot of miscommunication with Siri.amUsually a coffee stop in an Applegreen and quick send of urgent emails. pmAfter meetings I’m straight into the car and back to the office for an afternoon of edit viewings and development meetings. I try to be healthy at lunch time but often I don’t have much time so I do keep a supply of protein bars in ious bags and drawers in my desk.pmWe have three or sometimes four edit suites running concurrently and as managing director of the company I like to review all our programmes before they are sent to commissioning editors. When the editors want to keep me happy they know to bring me a cup of Earl Grey tea. .pmResearch and development is the cornerstone of our company so daily catch ups are crucial with the team.  .pmI really need to unwind after a busy day and when I can I nip into a yoga class on my way home.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
