That’s what this competition is about.’He added: ‘You take it to dizzy heights that stirs emotion.’And stir emotion it did.And the response was amazing.When announcing the three finalists, David, Kenny and Nawamin viewers were floored once more when John nearly teared up a second time.The heightened emotions had everyone on edge, it seemed, when one viewer said: ‘John Torode getting emotional when announcing the Masterchef final three nearly broke me.’If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/concordia-header.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"5 worst things happened friday 13th","story":"Luxury cruise ship Costa Concordia overturned after hitting an Italian reef on Friday 13th (Picture: AP PhotoGregorio Borgia)Friday 13th is not a day to be messed with, and we’re not just saying that because we’re wimps.History offers plenty of evidence that bad things happen on this doom-laden date, some of them so bad that they’ve fanned the flames of the world’s oddest superstition.And while the origin of this strange date is not crystal clear, its ‘effects’ have had an irreparable, negative impact on people’s lives.So without further ado, here are the five (listing the top 13 is not advisable today) worst things that have happened on Friday 13th.On Friday 13 October 1972, a plane full of Uruguayan rugby players crashed into the snowy Chilean mountains.Only 27 of the original 45 passengers survived, and without supplies, those still alive had to eat their dead teammates.A few weeks later, an avalanche killed eight more. The 16 remaining survivors were not rescued until the end of December. Grim.And on the same day of that plane crash, October 13, a plane in Moscow crashed into the ground, killing all 174 on board.On Friday 13 January 2012, a huge cruise ship called the Costa Concordia capsized off the Tuscan coast near Isola del Giglio after it struck a reef and began to tilt.Thirty-two people died (and possibly more due to the fact some unregistered people were aboard). The captain of the ship was found guilty of manslaughter for not evacuating passengers properly.The cost of the rescue and clear-up was £1.4 billion, more than three times the £430 million construction bill for the ship.On Friday 13 March 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was brutally raped and murdered in front of a New York block of flats.The crime is infamous because according to reports, more than 30 people witnessed the crime at their windows, without one person intervening or calling the police.This event gave its name to the psychological phenomena Genovese syndrome (aka bystander effect), which happens when people fail to do the right thing if they’re in a crowd.On Friday 13 November 1970, a cyclone hit Bangladesh, causing a tidal wave and eventually killing around 500,000 people.Livestock were wiped out, as were crops in hundreds of fields, meaning the disaster also caused mass starvation for a long period afterwards.Friday 13 1939 saw the beginning of the worst bushfire in history, now known as the Black Friday bushfires.In Victoria, Australia, almost 20,000 km² (nearly 5 million acres) of land was turned to ash, 1,300 home were burned down and 71 people died.Several towns were totally destroyed, and three quarters of the state of Victoria was affected, giving the appearance that the whole area had been cursed during the blaze.MORE: Arctic Monkeys tickets are released this morning – when, where and at what price?MORE: Is the new God of War game open world?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7175273.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"myspace sold embarrassing old secrets difficult cure cringe","story":"Myspace founder Tom and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg (Credit: Getty, Splash News)The world is still reeling from revelations about how 87 million people’s private Facebook data was allegedly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.Now it turns out that the hoary old social network Myspace flogged all your data years ago.Founder Tom Anderson sold it to Rupert Murdoch in 2005 for $520 million, who then flogged it to the ad tech firm Viant in 2011.

What a vile sentiment. How desperately outdated and slut shaming and generally ignorant. Unsurprisingly, the replies to the tweet shared a general consensus. The man who wrote it was a nasty person.But you know what else the majority of the replies had in common?Speculation about his penis.People said he didn’t have a penis, that his penis was tiny, that he didn’t know how to use his penis. Balls were a feature too. Small balls, shriveled balls, tiny balls.How did we arrived at a place where the default response to a person saying something ignorant and untrue is to insult a part of their anatomy?Because in a world where we find ourselves arguing with complete strangers on the internet, we have to grapple for insults that sting. Which, when it comes to men, means penis comments.Both physically and emotionally, if you want to hurt a man, you aim between the legs. Almost every man I’ve ever dated has been insecure about the size of his penis, wishing that it was longer.Men are taught their entire life that their worth, their power and their prowess stems from the size of their sexual organs.It doesn’t seem to matter that most women only have a four inch deep vagina, or that women are for the most part spectacularly disinterested in balls (big balls are fine, small balls are fine, we honestly do not care about balls).Despite extensive research and writing that demonstrates the opposite, men are forced to regard the size of their genitalia as the most important aspect of their sexual abilities and a defining characteristic as a man. So it’s no surprise that it’s the first weapon we reach for in our internet argument arsenal.I know how tempting it is. I’ve done it myself. We all remember the moment in Notting Hill where Julia Roberts tells a group of astonished wankers ‘I’m sure you didn’t mean any harm, I’m sure it was just friendly banter, I’m sure you guys have dicks the size of peanuts. Enjoy your dinner, the tuna’s really good.’(Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images)But in a world where we stand against body shaming, I’m afraid I think we have to stop. For two reasons, really.Firstly, because it’s lazy. When someone is talking trash on the internet, or in real life, we should do better than throwing a lazy penis comment their way. We should dismantle their argument, or we should ignore them.Secondly, body shaming isn’t nice and it isn’t okay. It’s the same as when people call Katie Hopkins ugly. You might think that she’s a terrible person, that she insights racial hatred or that she’s a terrible example to her children. But the lack of symmetry in her face isn’t symmetrical is not relevant.Men worry about their penis size. Men are self conscious about it. For some men it ruins their sex lives, leaves them feeling depressed and can be part of wider mental health issues. Talking about small penises as if they’re the end of the world or something you should be ashamed of only makes that problem worse.People’s terrible opinions and horrible comments are bad because they’re bad. Not because of the body that they came from. When we focus on the latter we are distracted from the former, and we lose the moral high ground.How does it feel to have synaesthesia? Meet the people whose senses blend*I mean, it’s arguing on the internet, it’s very unlikely.

He should have had the decency to refer himself rather than sweep this under the carpet.\u0027 Last night No 10 said: \u0027Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the Ministerial Code. We consider the matter closed.\u0027But a former MPs\u0027 watchdog said that if Mr Hunt did not \u0027face consequences\u0027 it could create a \u0027perception of double standards\u0027, with \u0027one rule for the political elite and another rule for the rest of the population\u0027.          Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton (pictured) in FebruarySir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Daily Telegraph, which revealed the oversight: \u0027It is a very poor show when ministers, who you expect to take leadership in standards ... do not meet the rules they are required to meet.\u0027If there has been a failure of leadership, there should be a political price for it. Either in terms of the damage to your reputation or to action by the Prime Minister in the case of the Ministerial Code, or by the Committee on Standards.\u0027Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton in February. The average price paid for properties in the development is £240,000 per flat, according to Zoopla.          The oversight is a criminal offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prisonThe mortgages were issued by a private bank to Mare Pond Properties Limited, a company set up by Mr Hunt and his wife Lucia Guo. Miss Guo was the only person named in the registration documents filed at Companies House when the firm was incorporated in September 2017. Mr Hunt appears to have breached the Companies Act on two counts. He should have declared to Companies House he was a \u0027person with significant control\u0027 within 28 days of registration. But he did not do so for six months.Legislation passed by the Tories in 2016 made this compulsory for anyone who has more than 25 per cent of shares or voting rights in a company. The law was a central part of the Government\u0027s plan to tackle money laundering, and failure to comply is an offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison.The second breach relates to the fact Mr Hunt\u0027s name was omitted from the registration document – a criminal offence under another section of the Companies Act. Parliamentary rules state MPs must register any shareholding greater than 15 per cent in any company within 28 days. But Mr Hunt took nearly five months to do so, registering his co-ownership of the company alongside the purchase of the flats in the Register of MPs\u0027 Interests on March 7.He told the Telegraph the breaches were down to an honest mistake by his accountant and that he had corrected the listing after being alerted to it by a member of the public on March 28.           Mr Hunt has not breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct with the Ocean Village breach, according to Cabinet Office rules, and so retains the backing of Theresa MayHis spokesman said: \u0027These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified. \u0027Jeremy\u0027s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.\u0027The Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code. Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up. \u0027They advised that as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational. \u0027As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to Parliamentary declarations ... Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/04/4B19998A00000578-0-image-a-26_1523591770915.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle Chicago airport incognito finalize UK visa","story":"    Meghan Markle landed in Chicago\u0027s O\u0027Hare International Airport on Thursday morning to finalize her UK visa application          She was spotted walking through the airport in a White Sox baseball cap in an attempt to remain incognitoOne source said that Chicago police provided security for Meghan but did not give her an actual escort as she went through the airport. According to TMZ, Meghan entered the VFS Global UK Visa Application Centre in Chicago Thursday to finalize her application after she landed in the city. Meghan is set to attend key Commonwealth Youth Forum event...Meghan Markle is blasted by her sister for \u0027inviting...Share this articleThe entire process took about 10 minutes where staff cleared the office for her while she filled out the paperwork. Meghan reportedly paid an estimated $1,500 or more to have the visa expedited so she can receive in the next couple of days. This comes just one month before she is due at the alter to marry Prince Harry. They are scheduled to be wed at Windsor Castle on May 19 and more than 2,500 people have been invited to attend the event. The future wife to Prince Harry appears to be crossing some to-do items off her list before the ceremony.             Meghan reportedly had the Chicago visa office cleared out so she could finalize her visa.

In 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated the day to Saint Joseph the Worker and during the Cold War, May Day was marked with large military parades in the Red Square of the Soviet Union.When is Labour Day 2018?In the UK, after being introduced by Michael Foot, the then-Employment Secretary in 1978, Labour Day is celebrated on May Day and is marked as a spring bank holiday.As the bank holiday is always held on the first Monday in May and May Day falls on a Tuesday in 2018, the day will be marked on Monday, May 7, 2018.Although there are many traditional May Day rites that have existed for hundreds of years, May Day was not linked to International Workers’ Day until the 20th century and is not known officially as Labour Day in the UK.Where are the 2018 International Workers’ Day protests?Since the 2000s, anti-capitalist movements have held a number of protests across the UK that have resulted in clashes with the police. Most notably, in 2000, a statue of Winston Churchill was given a grass Mohawk hairstyle and the Cenotaph in London was defaced.In London, the May Day 2018 march will be held on Tuesday, May 1 and will see protestors assemble on Clerkenwell Green and walk to Trafalgar Square for a rally. Find out more information here.When is International Workers’ Day celebrated in other countries?In the US, more commonly known as Labor Day, is celebrated on the first Monday of September each year after becoming an official federal holiday in 1894.Most other countries hold their International Workers’ Days on May 1, apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina who celebrate on May 1 and May 2.

They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her  nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him.

I can\u0027t legally marry more than one person.\u0027            The 44-year-old therapist practices polyamory.

There are polyamorous social groups all across the country.\u0027Mrs Crumpton said there are \u0027hundreds of people at conventions\u0027, and \u0027a lot of people go to a Facebook group but only if it\u0027s really locked down\u0027. She continued: \u0027I stood in the local election three years ago just as an independent candidate.

I had boyfriends and was monogamous. Having more than one partner never crossed my mind.\u0027In my twenties I got married and settled down in Chorlton fully intending to be with my husband for life. At the time I didn\u0027t really question having just one partner.\u0027It was normal. I did sometimes have feelings for other people, but I felt guilty about doing so and just took it as a sign that I didn\u0027t love my husband enough. \u0027When the marriage didn\u0027t work out, I met someone else, and started a monogamous relationship with him.\u0027The idea that loving more than one person might not make me a terrible human being only dawned on me when, at a pub, I bumped into a person who had more than one partner.\u0027I had never come across it before, or the term \u0027polyamory\u0027 which means \u0027more-than-one love\u0027. I was quite shocked, and curious about how it all worked for them.\u0027My partner was with me when I met the polyamorous person, and he was curious about it too. At the time neither of us considered it for ourselves, but I think the seed had been planted.\u0027A couple of years later, in 2003, I suggested to him that perhaps we might try an open relationship. I was interested to explore the possibility of allowing myself to love more than one person.             Mrs Crumpton said her husband Tim (pictured together) and fiancé are friends\u0027I think for him it was more about the thought of more than one sexual partner. We were both curious to see how it could work for us.\u0027I took to it immediately. I had a friend that I was already close to and that friendship drifted very naturally into something more. My partner had a similar experience with a friend of his. It was a revelation to me.\u0027I quickly realised that I had been \u0027wired up\u0027 this way probably all my life - loving more than one person now seems like the most natural thing in the world to me and I can\u0027t imagine being any other way. \u0027For me, it is all about love. Of course, some of my relationships have been sexual, but sex is not the driving force for me.\u0027I am no longer with the partner that I first explored polyamory with, though he and I remain close friends, and he has continued to be polyamorous.\u0027I married one of the people I first dated polyamorously. My husband, Tim, who is 43, and I got together in 2004 and were married in 2013 at Manchester Museum under the Tyrannosaurus Rex.\u0027I have a partner, John, 53, who I have been with since 2011, and who I am planning to \u0027marry\u0027 this year. We can\u0027t legally marry, but we are having a full wedding-style commitment ceremony at Chorlton Unitarian church in May.\u0027Both men are heterosexual and have been brought together through Mrs Crumpton. They have all lived together since 2015.Mrs Crumpton has another two other partners, Michael, who she has been with since 2016 and James.She said: \u0027John has been living with me and my husband in our house in Chorlton since 2015.             Tim (pictured) was one of the first people that she had a polyamorous relationship with\u0027He has a flat a few streets away from my house and I usually stay over at his place once or twice a week, and sometimes he stays at mine. Michael spent Christmas with us and we had a really special day together.\u0027Last but not least, I am with James, 73, who I bonded with while watching football games in the pub together in 2015. My husband and John have no interest in football, so it is nice to have someone to share that interest with.\u0027One of the lovely things about a life with more than one partner is that there is no pressure on one person to supply all my needs.\u0027My husband Tim and I share an enthusiasm for environmentalism and all that entails, like electric cars, and veganism. With my fiancé John I enjoy watching science-fiction and we go to church together.\u0027With Michael, I like to watch and support him playing for his local darts team at the Royal Oak, and we go to karaoke nights - which is possibly more embarrassing than admitting to polyamory!\u0027Living in a house with more than one partner is something I have done for a number of years now. I suppose in many ways it is no different from living in a shared house with a group of friends, or family.\u0027All the usual things about whose turn it is to wash up etc. Tim and John get on well, I suppose a bit like brothers, going on bicycle rides together for example. So it seems to work okay.\u0027They have something in common in that they both love me of course, and friends joke that I need two of them to keep me in-line.\u0027Like in any relationship, insecurities can arise. Though in some ways there is less jealousy perhaps - no fear that a partner might cheat on me because why lie about it when having another partner is allowed anyway? \u0027Sometimes there might be a fear that a new partner is \u0027better\u0027 in some way than a current one, but good communication and offering reassurances allows that to be dealt with.             Tim and John are straight and have been brought together through Mrs Crumpton\u0027In many ways I have found that being in open relationships has forced me to communicate much better.\u0027I am very honest and open with my partners about my feelings and needs, in a way that I didn\u0027t have the courage to be in previous monogamous relationships. So I think I have grown as a person, and have better and stronger relationships now.\u0027Of course, all of that is possible in monogamous relationships, and I am not suggesting polyamory is in any way better, just different. But it works well for me personally.\u0027I don\u0027t have children, and have no desire to have children. I see no problem with bringing children into a polyamorous set-up though, because I have seen co-parenting work really well for other polyamorous groups. It is not something we plan though.\u0027Mostly people have been great. They had lots of questions about it, and some family members needed reassurance that we were all happy and no-one was getting hurt. I find that I have a huge capacity for romantic love.\u0027I just naturally fall in love with more than one person at a time. So to settle down with just one person for the rest of my life just doesn\u0027t feel natural to me.\u0027People sometimes ask me if it means that I love my husband, or any of my partners less. And I say no. Perhaps it is a bit like how we love our children - when a parent has a second or third child, it doesn\u0027t mean that they love their first child any the less.\u0027I think that romantic love is unlimited too. Time is limited of course. But I do not believe that love is. It certainly isn\u0027t for me.\u0027I get different reactions. Most people are interested and people often say \u0027I wish my wifehusband would let me do that\u0027. I sometimes get negative reactions too - I have been called a slapper or a slag.\u0027I think that negativity mostly arises because I am doing something a bit different and sometimes that can make people feel uncomfortable.             Mrs Crumpton said she has no problem with bringing children into a polyamorous set-up\u0027I have had women assume that I am a \u0027man-eater\u0027 and will try to seduce their husband - to be honest that just makes me laugh.\u0027I have also been told that what I do is \u0027against God\u0027s law\u0027, though in fact there are many instances of multiple marriages in religious texts, and there are denominations of both Christianity and Islam that allow multiple marriages.\u0027Mostly though, people are open to my lifestyle - they can see that I am honest with my partners and that we are all happy, so they see it as no-ones business but ours.\u0027Polyamory is more widely known about now too so it is perhaps less of a shock to people now than it might have been, say, 10 years ago.\u0027We all go out together. For example all going out for drinks for my birthday or to social gatherings and events organised by friends or trips to the cinema or whatever. Tim, John and I go down to London to see my family the three of us. And my sister\u0027s children refer to us as \u0027Auntie Mary, Uncle Tim and Uncle John\u0027.\u0027People have the idea that polyamory is all about sex which isn\u0027t the case. I don\u0027t do one night-stands. I generally wait a month or so at least before becoming sexual with anyone I start dating. I suppose in that sense I am old-fashioned.\u0027My relationships themselves vary in how sexual they are - one of them being more platonic with not much more than cuddling and kissing.\u0027I suppose that, for me, is another good thing about polyamory - each relationship can find its own level in terms of sex and with other things too. And there is no pressure on one relationship to tick all the boxes, so to speak.\u0027Some of the biggest benefits of this way of living are those I have already mentioned, but I guess there is a financial benefit I haven\u0027t mentioned - cohabiting with two of my partners makes things easier financially for us.\u0027So much so, that the three of us took the decision that I would reduce my paid-work-hours and do more unpaid voluntary work in our community.          Manchester Green Party has spoken of its pride at Mrs Crumpton for discussing polyamory\u0027The only negative for me really is dealing with other people being judgemental sometimes. But thankfully I am quite thick-skinned. And I hope that my being open about it with friends, and your readers, will help people understand polyamory better.\u0027Maybe this will mean that there will be less judgement from strangers in the future, just as homosexuality and transexuality have become more accepted in society as people have been more aware of them.\u0027   A Manchester Green Party spokesman said: \u0027We are humbled and proud of our council candidate for Chorlton, Mary Crumpton, for openly discussing a topic that many people would fear due to potential controversy. \u0027Mary has spoken with warmth and responded to hateful comments with dignity traits which would make for an excellent councillor.\u0027The Green Party passed a motion at our Autumn 2017 conference, officially recognising the validity of polyamorous relationships. \u0027We will continue to encourage and champion ersity amongst our members, activists and candidates, and we encourage anyone who is inspired by this story to join us and become part of a welcoming and truly progressive party.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ee88c4b60cd6fd315fb472beb8989920dd59a9/0_231_897_538/master/897.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=233fea6f8107944b5477e289cdd3c468 1240w","title":"art exhibitions beuys brazil bomberg the week in art","story":"The visionary artist’s most powerful sculptures go on show while a new landmark floats on a London lake and Newcastle surveys Bomberg – all in your weekly dispatchBeatriz Milhazes: Rio AzulDazzling abstract explosions of colour that update the modernism of Sonia Delaunay to 21st-century Brazil.• White Cube Bermondsey, London, 18 April-1 July.Joseph Beuys: Utopia at the Stag MonumentsSome of this visionary artist’s most powerful sculptures are brought together in an exhibition curated by his collaborator Norman Rosenthal.• Galerie Thaddeus Ropac, Ely House, London, 18 April–16 June.Sony World Photography AwardsGerman artist Candida Höfer gets a special display within this survey of the global photography scene.• Somerset House, London, 20 April-6 May.BombergA welcome survey of one of the most powerful British artists of the early 20th century.• Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, until 28 May.Somewhere in BetweenExplorations on the frontier of art and science by Martina Amati, Daria Martin, Maria McKinney and John Walter.• Wellcome Collection, London, until 27 August.Landscape With a Footbridge (c 1518-20) by Albrecht AltdorferThis eerie painting transports us to a wild medieval German landscape where you could easily encounter a werewolf, witches or death – at least, it can inspire such daydreams if you let it.

It makes sense: more than four in five Australians live within easy walking or driving distance of the sea. As writer Anna Funder recently said of those who call the driest continent on Earth home: “We cling to the edge of the continent, and we swim from a very early age.”Growing up, I hated swimming – which was awful, because I didn’t just grow up in Australia, I grew up in Queensland: the sun-saturated state that gifted us Olympic gods like Kieran Perkins, Susie O’Neill, Grant Hackett and Stephanie Rice, a state where the main trade seemed to be sugar, coal and championship swimmers.You weren’t just expected to know how to swim you were expected to be good at it, too.My parents were Cantonese migrants from Hong Kong who, in the 1970s, moved to Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, home to some of the country’s most beautiful beaches. It still strikes me as a slightly baffling decision, given neither of them could swim. Water compelled and terrified them and their five Australian-born kids.While other people saw stunning coastlines, we just saw a picturesque way to die. Rips could kill you, people said. Sharks could kill you. Skin cancer could kill you. Weirdly, it was always white people who told us these things, the same white people who seemed to keep going to the beach. Were we missing something? Did they want to die?A safer option was the public pool. Years of TV safety campaigns had convinced Mum we needed to know how to swim, because she sure as hell couldn’t save us if we were drowning. Throughout summer, we’d wail as Mum drove us to the nearest suburban leisure centre for lessons. I suspect we dreaded those lessons as much as our instructors dreaded teaching us, those hopeless Asian kids spluttering with anxiety inside the enclosed training pool, those stinking hothouses of chemicals, piss and wet togs (or cossies, or bathers, or swimmers – depending on your state).After the nightmare was over, we’d be sedated with a treat – a Redskin (Australians veer towards racism even with our confectionary), an ice block or a packet of frogs – before falling asleep in the stuffy Ford Cortina, hair matted to our temples, seat belts twisted into our skin and fingers dusted orange from the Twisties we stole from each other.The horror didn’t end there. At school, not only were swimming lessons mandatory, carnivals were too – annual, school-run swim meets, ostensibly fun but deeply competitive. We even had togs in school colours that we had to buy from the uniform shop.During the lessons, I’d watch fit white kids e in and carve through water with graceful limbs that seemed custom-built for the job. Meanwhile, in Lane 1 or 6 – where I could still hold onto the wall – I’d windmill uselessly, my hands banging into the water like saucepans. There was a direct, inverse correlation between the amount of splashing I made and the distance I travelled. At swimming carnivals, all the outcasts were bunched together: the ethnic kid with no body fat (me) pale kids with lots of body fat. We had to swim in an event – any event – so we’d do the novelty race, paddling together on inflatable rafts, damp with chlorine and shame, as everyone cheered and jeered us on. But then, weirdly, I fell in love with swimming. I left home for university, moved to Brisbane and into a rambling architectural mess of a shared house. Its design was … incorrect. It attracted the heat in summer, then trapped it. During heatwaves, my flatmates and I would emerge from our rooms having barely slept and looking boiled. I took refuge from the heat at the Olympic-sized council pool at the bottom of our hill. It didn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it was pure and clean, with a panoramic view of the city skyline. I didn’t have proper togs so I swam in black boxer briefs, hoping no one would notice. After a while, I tried swimming laps.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Alan, the pool manager, took pity on me. “Instead of bashing into the water with your arms like that,” he said, “stretch out like this and twist your entire torso. Instead of exhaling like that, hum and you won’t lose your breath so quickly.” It was homework, and I’d always liked homework. Slowly, I got faster.By the time I moved to Sydney, I owned proper Speedos, goggles and a kickboard. I signed myself up for a 1km charity ocean swim. From some angles it seemed as though I had pecs. Who was this person?I’ve been helped by the fact Sydney has – hands down – the best lap pools in the world. Every inner-city public pool is a wonder in some way. My local, the Prince Alfred Park Pool, is an award-winning architectural miracle built into a hill – like a swimming oasis for hobbits. It’s impossible to take a bad photo of North Sydney Olympic Pool, where the reward for finishing laps is endless Instagram-ready photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which towers above the pool like a CGI hallucination. On the other side of the harbour, Andrew “Boy” Charlton Pool is plonked right in the middle of the botanical gardens, decked out like a resort and boasting so many toned men in Speedos, it feels like you’re in the video for Kylie Minogue’s Slow.Even Sydney’s indoor pools – which I usually avoid because of the claustrophobic chlorine pong – are impressive. Ultimo’s dreamy, wave-walled Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (the first Sydney pool I ever swam in) is a Harry Seidler original, a modernist wave of concrete and steel rising from Darling Harbour. In the Cook + Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are giant paintings by the Archibald winner Wendy Sharpe, making it one of the few places where you can do laps in an art gallery.For a spiritual experience, it’s all about the ocean baths. On good days, you can swim alongside schools of fish in Wylie’s Baths in Coogee. There’s a reason people rave about Bondi Icebergs, with its sauna overlooking the violent churn of the surf below. And though I’ll never get to visit, I love the idea of Coogee’s McIver’s Ladies Baths, the last remaining women’s-only seawater pool in Australia. Apparently it’s particularly popular with nuns, Muslim women and lesbians I like thinking about the unexpected friendships that have been made there.Is it too far to say swimming is the Australian version of baptism? To me, these places feel sacred to swim in them veers towards sacrament. When I get writer’s block, I swim. When I need space, I swim. When I need company, I swim. When I’m depressed, I swim. When I’m happy, I swim.Last Christmas, my siblings and I – all comically terrible swimmers as kids – laughed at the fact that our eldest sister was now a regular surfer. The remaining four of us now swim regularly in lap pools. Those Asian kids at school, so bad at swimming carnivals that they were constantly disqualified? Well, some of them grew up and now swim  kilometres for leisure. It shouldn’t be surprising – we’re also Australian, after all.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

But while the politics of the border have been extensively discussed, the practical importance of the customs union is still not widely understood. While it may sound dry and technical, what\u0026nbspit controls is as basic as bread and milk, and the way millions of citizens will live their lives.The Northern Irish economy depends on its agri-food exports. The lion’s share of the £1.15bn a year in Northern Irish exports to the EU flows across the Irish border, moving through one of the 275 or so crossing points along its 300-mile stretch. Small tracks, minor roads and EU-funded dual carriageways are used for the\u0026nbspthousands of daily movements of people, lorries and\u0026nbspanimals back and forth. Forty percent of lamb reared\u0026nbspin the north travels over to the south for processing, as does up to a third of Northern Ireland’s milk production. Food and drink is the north’s largest manufacturing sector and one in 10 jobs depend on it.In a report out this week, experts from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and City University of\u0026nbspLondon dismiss the idea of a technological answer to the customs union problem, aired most recently by foreign secretary Boris Johnson in a radio interview, as a fantasy. At the moment food moves freely through infrastructure that is largely invisible. Even if the political consequences of a new, hard border were surmountable, the practical ones seem unmanageable.A complex web of port operators, clearance agents and logistics companies currently makes customs declarations for shipments in and out of the EU by filling\u0026nbspin online declaration forms for Revenue \u0026amp\u0026nbspCustoms. The department was developing a new IT\u0026nbspsystem before the Brexit vote. Its creaking 30-year-old system has typically dealt with about 55m customs declarations a year the\u0026nbspnew one was only designed to manage up to 150m, but now HMRC estimates that Brexit\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspcreate 255m a year.

Perhaps\u0026nbspit’s none of my business, except when these things become public knowledge, it’s because they\u0026nbspare exposed in court.That\u0026nbspword\u0026nbsp“legends” sticks in my\u0026nbspmind. Or rather in my craw. It was in one of the WhatsApp messages read out in court in the Belfast trial of the “star rugby players”, Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding, accused of rape and\u0026nbspunanimously found not guilty last month.The messages discussing what had happened the night before, for which they later apologised, talked\u0026nbspof “shaggers”, of “Belfast sluts”, of “pumping a bird” and “spit-roasting”. Such technical terms had to be\u0026nbspexplained by barristers to the judge and jury, but somehow it was the self-glorifying “Why are we are such legends?” in the players’ WhatsApp group that got me. Legends indeed.I am not sure this is the word they would be using now. This was a high-profile trial in which the woman who had\u0026nbspaccused them of rape had her bloodied knickers\u0026nbsppassed around a courtroom, in which the taxi driver who took her home told of her sobbing, and her distressed texts were also read out. Since the men’s acquittal further details have been released, of a\u0026nbsppornographic video shared with Olding the day after\u0026nbspthe night in question.The jury unanimously acquitted these men of rape.\u0026nbspTheir friends Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison were\u0026nbspunanimously found not guilty of indecent exposure\u0026nbspand of perverting the course of justice. None\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthese men did anything illegal. Yet they are now\u0026nbspfighting in a different court: the court of public opinion. The widespread disgust at the way that they spoke about\u0026nbspthe woman who they had sex with clings to\u0026nbspthem. It is the nature of what these young men said to\u0026nbspeach other that has appalled so many people and led to\u0026nbspthe creation of the hashtag #IBelieveHer.One wonders about the kind of sex these premier\u0026nbspathletes actually want. This week Otto Putland, a swimmer who\u0026nbsprepresented Wales at the Commonwealth Games,\u0026nbspwas also cleared of rape at Cardiff crown court. He had denied forcing himself on\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspwoman after\u0026nbspshe had\u0026nbspconsensual sex with his friend, the Olympic swimmer Ieuan Lloyd.Does male bonding have to involve the seeming humiliation of women, as it does in some American college fraternities? Is it always a kind of performance that needs to be watched by their mates? In the Belfast trial\u0026nbspwhere a slang expert was brought in to explain “spit–roasting”, the woman spoke of one player penetrating her from behind while another player walked in naked, holding his penis, looking to join in.Footballer Ched Evans, unanimously cleared of rape\u0026nbspin 2016, had sex with a woman in a hotel room following a night out in Rhyl, immediately after his friend Clayton McDonald had had sex with her. Evans\u0026nbspleft via a fire exit without speaking to the woman.\u0026nbspHis younger brother and another man watched\u0026nbspthe encounter through a window.So is this is the ultimate in hyper-masculine male bonding? What is happening when these young sportsmen who know each other’s bodies, whose business is their bodies, choose to enact their\u0026nbspsexual desires in this way?Of course, there is no reason why\u0026nbspsuch\u0026nbspsexual activity should not be consensual, and a lot of pornography indicates that such\u0026nbspencounters are every woman’s\u0026nbspfantasy. Perhaps, though, in such scenarios, the women is the vessel through which these young guys communicate their\u0026nbsppower to each other?These men are not rapists, but they are guilty of\u0026nbsp vile misogyny. None of them presumably has difficulty getting women, who flock to them. To bring\u0026nbspJackson and Olding back on to the rugby field now,\u0026nbspas their supporters are demanding, would appear\u0026nbspto endorse what looks like degrading behaviour. This would hardly be the first time such a thing has happened. But\u0026nbsphow do we teach the boys who admire and emulate sportsmen to respect women if this is how\u0026nbsptheir role models conduct themselves? Talking after his acquittal about the risks of mixing alcohol and sex, Ched Evans said he had been “young” and “stupid” at the time.Is behaviour such as Jackson’s and Olding’s – which some seem willing to write off as high jinks, high-testosterone pranks – in fact best understood as being meant for each other? These men may need an audience for their performances and then to congratulate each other the next day. But is this really living the dream?For that dream, as we have seen, can turn into a nightmare for everyone involved, while a woman can look from the outside as if she is a disposable conduit, not a person in her own right. This is where we still are. And yet there are voices telling us to think about these poor innocent lads whose reputations are ruined. It is shameful.Misogyny is not a crime, clearly, but spare me the suffering of these rugby legends. For them to be portrayed as victims, now? That is truly unbelievable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51bb3c7bbeeb9686e8c187845226de381ae5058c/447_442_6024_3614/master/6024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74d40fd8cea88f19e524a6c7687ec155 1240w","title":"british museum director hartwig fischer there are no foreigners here the museum is a world country","story":"The German art historian reveals plans for an extensive revamp at Britain’s most visited attraction, but won’t be drawn on calls to return plundered worksHartwig Fischer, who took over the directorship of the British Museum from Neil MacGregor two years ago, has no decoration on the plain blue walls of his office. There are glass-fronted bookshelves. There ia a desk and chairs and two enormous sash windows looking out on to the great forecourt. (Or, more immediately, on to what some staff call the “Bake Off tent” – the ugly temporary structure through which visitors must currently pass for security checks.) But there is nothing to signal Fischer’s taste – nothing like the glimmering wall sculpture by El Anatsui that MacGregor had nothing like the array of Staffordshire pottery that Tristram Hunt displays in his office at the V\u0026ampA no equivalent to the Paula Rego that Maria Balshaw favours in her lair at Tate. There is only a reproduction of a Cycladic figure on the fireplace, a leftover from the MacGregor years, and, on his desk lamp, a tiny figurine of Sai Baba, a spiritual master revered as a saint, which Indian friends gave him.Instead, he says, he prefers to concentrate on the people who come through his doors – and the great treasure house of the museum. But the blankness of his working space radiates through his personal manner: he is warm and friendly, but oddly remote. His employees contrast the charismatic immediacy of MacGregor, who had the disconcerting habit of plonking himself down by random staffers in the canteen and interrogating them about their work, with this more distant figure, who speaks softly and carefully, who glides modestly around the galleries, who is sphinx-like in his statements. But for all that, he is quietly formidable, and has vast ambitions for the museum – plans that will, if they see the light of day, transform the museum for generations to come.Fischer, 56, who came to London after running the state museums in Dresden, is aiming to put the museum, in all its shopworn grandeur, through a major renovation project that will culminate in a complete redisplay of its galleries. That doesn’t sound so remarkable until you begin to absorb the scale of the job. When I joke that it can’t be as big as the Palace of Westminster’s renovation, which will cost at least £3.5bn, he tells me that the museum has more rooms than parliament – 3,000 versus 1,100 – and that the state of the essential services, such as electricity, gas and water are in dire need of repair, just as they are at Westminster. He has in mind something as grand and decisive as the “projet grand” Louvre, which saw the building of IM Pei’s dramatic pyramids and cost between F6bn and F7bn (around £780m at 1993 prices). Or the recent renovation of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which saw the institution closed for a decade and a bill of €375m.Unlike Amsterdam, though, Fischer says: “We cannot close the museum. It’s entirely out of the question.” The British Museum is the most visited attraction in Britain, with 5.9m visitors last year. Work will have to be phased. It will take years. As for even a vague price tag, he is not to be drawn: assessments are still being carried out. And who will pay? Clearly, there will have to be the mother of all fundraising campaigns. But Fischer carefully notes that the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum were renewed “with the support of their governments”. What Fischer hopes to achieve by the end of all this is a display that is more coherent – and more interconnected. That means reshuffling the Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections so that they are not scattered between two floors as they are at present, and also finding ways to show that, as Fischer puts it, “human history was driven and has always been driven by exchange, by cultures communicating”. The interconnectedness he is keen to demonstrate might also be across time: towards the end of our interview we go over to the museum’s big exhibition space, where a stunning show on Rodin and ancient Greek sculpture is being installed. It’s the first exhibition to have been largely developed under his leadership, and its approach – looking at how an artist was shaped by his understanding of the past – might prove a hint at the shape of the programme to come.It’s an intriguing time to be considering the renewal of the British Museum – one of the world’s few so-called “encyclopedic museums” – as Fischer puts it, “a museum of the world for the world”. But Britain is on the brink of Brexit, turning its face away from Europe. When I ask Fischer if he would have taken the job had it been offered on 24 June 2016, he says: “Yes, without any hesitation whatsoever.” This contrasts to the view taken by the late Martin Roth, his predecessor at Dresden, whose resignation from the V\u0026ampA in September 2016 was said to have been hastened by disillusion at the referendum.The museum’s job, Fischer says, is to take the long view, to confront the whole of human history, to understand that Brexit is a moment in the turbulent story of the world. But at the same time: “Everyone who knows me knows I come from a European background and that Europe, as it developed after the catastrophe of the wars is something very important and precious to me. The museum has a lot to offer to help people to contemplate and reflect on what the right decisions should be without taking a direct political stance. It’s there as a space to think, reflect, debate.” It is true that Fischer could hardly be more European. He was raised in Hamburg, studied in Italy and France, and has worked in Switzerland as well as Germany his wife is a psychotherapist in Paris. It’s easy to imagine what his personal views might be, even if for now, they are cloaked in civil service neutrality. He simply says: “Whoever comes in here and crosses the threshold is not a foreigner. There are no foreigners here. This is a world country, this museum. While at the same time we recognise that this is a British creation, to which the cultures of all the world have contributed.”Contributed, yes – but not always willingly. The museum’s collection is inextricably entwined with Britain’s dark imperial past. Increasingly, nations want their objects back: not just the Greeks and the Parthenon sculptures, but others – there is a longstanding claim from Ethiopia, for example, about works of art plundered from Maqdala after its capture by the British in 1868.It’s all very well, I suggest, talking of the museum as an international project, and even as a space where international co-operation between colleagues can continue when formal diplomatic ties are strained. (Fischer made a visit to Iran in December when we meet, he has just returned from Egypt.) But the buck stops for many with the objects themselves, with the fact of possession and ownership. “When you go to see the Parthenon sculptures,” he says, “you can read about the different views, the conflicting views, and we respect different views.” Respecting views is one thing, but keeping the objects is another – that’s the line drawn right there, isn’t it? “It is a line. But what’s been created here is a major contribution to humanity. So while I respect these views, I always say what has been created here, which is open to everybody, creates an extraordinary opportunity to see cultural heritage in a context you have in only a very few places. That is the museum’s major value and it is very precious.”Fischer has come into this environment from the relatively easier circumstances of Germany, where government support for culture, though under recent pressure, is understood as a given, not fought over tooth and nail every step of the way. One of the things he is really passionate about is a music festival he has organised it will see everything from Ligeti and Nono to Japanese temple music performed in the museum’s galleries. “I’ve always worked with musicians in museums,” he says. “When you look at things listening, you look at things differently. The ears make you see more, and the eyes make you hear more.” Ironically, the festival, which is organised in partnership with the Dresden museums, is being paid for by the German foreign ministry. Still, what impresses him in London, he says, is his staff’s passionate sense of public mission. “You would never think about doing something in this place before asking who it is for. You would never get lost in an intricate scholarly debate without coming back to that question: ‘How is our public going to profit from this?’ And I cherish every day working in this environment.”The music festival Europe and the World: a Symphony of Cultures, runs from 16 to 29 April. Rodin and the art of Ancient Greece runs from 26 April to 29 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21652220c12e4a62c5360786df0c1f2077c63afc/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a09b7e20b1f8199ca8594d62834d6468 1240w","title":"uk university strike action to end after staff vote to accept offer","story":"Ballot finds two-to-one majority in favour of accepting offer to reopen talks over pensionsThe strike action that hit 65 universities across the UK this year is to end after staff voted to accept an offer to reopen negotiations with employers over their pensions.The ballot of 50,000 University and College Union members in higher education found a two-to-one majority in favour of accepting the offer, which establishes a joint committee of experts to look at staff pensions provided through the University Superannuation Scheme (USS).Fourteen days of teaching were lost to strikes on 65 campuses, with fears that further action in the coming term would disrupt final examinations and mean that students on some courses might be unable to graduate.The strike centred on a radical overhaul of the USS – the country’s largest private sector pension scheme with 400,000 members at 67 universities and colleges, as well as 300 specialist institutions such as the Royal Society and Cancer Research UK. Staff anger was triggered by a decision in January in favour of the employers that would have ended the scheme’s defined benefits – guaranteed levels of payment to members upon retirement.Instead, the fixed benefits would be replaced by defined contributions, in which members would pay in but their eventual pension payments would be dictated by their level of payment and the state of financial markets at retirement.The Office for Students – the universities regulator in England – has told universities to make clear to students what the impact of the industrial action will be and how any related disruption will be handled.Universities UK said the decision to appoint an expert panel and suspend industrial action would reassure students that their summer exams would not be affected. “It is important that interested parties engage with the panel and remain open-minded about its possible findings,” a UUK spokesperson said.“Working in partnership with UCU, we will now appoint a jointly agreed chair for the panel as soon as possible before developing its terms of reference, order of work and timescales.”Sally Hunt, the UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.“We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67569b0771060a3b13f5ffb27a58fa10aef41bf7/92_0_3274_1965/master/3274.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b103f1524c02a8701533fadb160f47a5 1240w","title":"mps to pressure government on backing for swansea tidal lagoon project","story":"Committees seek clarity on indecision over taxpayer support and price guarantees for flagship tidal clean energy scheme to harness tide powerMPs are to press ministers on why they have left investors hanging in limbo over taxpayer support for a pioneering £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea.The business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee and Welsh affairs committee will call on government to explain why no decision has been forthcoming on the flagship scheme. The government has still not indicated whether it is minded to support the lagoon, 15 months since an independent review told ministers to back the clean energy project.Tidal Lagoon Power, a Gloucester-based company, has been pushing for years to build the first of five lagoons at Swansea, to harness power from the ebb and flow of the tides.But the company needs an indication the government is prepared to negotiate a guaranteed price of power for the renewable energy it produces, akin to the ones awarded to windfarm and nuclear power station developers.The BEIS and Welsh affairs committees will now hold an evidence session on the government’s decision-making process, most likely in May, the Guardian understands.The energy minister, Claire Perry, would be the obvious government representative to be quizzed by the MPs on the indecision, which Tidal Lagoon Power recently warned could lead it to significantly reduce its workforce.Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the BEIS committee, has previously urged minister to give investors clarity on the lagoon. “If they don’t think it can make a contribution, then they should be honest about that and explain what other measures they will take to reduce our carbon emissions,” she has said.Greg Clark, business secretary, told parliament in March that he did not “want to close the door” on the project yet.But he also said that the proposal had initially required a subsidy price twice as expensive as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Privately, in letters to the Welsh government, which has offered to help on financing the lagoon, Clark said the technology was untried, with high capital costs and significant uncertainties. The Welsh government said talks with Whitehall had been constructive but “need to get into far more detail” to reach a swift conclusion.A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Any decision on the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project will have to represent value for money for the UK taxpayer as well as the consumer.”Tidal Lagoon Power declined to comment.While the Swansea lagoon is currently stalled, another UK tidal power project took an important step forward this week.Scotland-based Atlantis announced the first of its tidal power array in the Pentland Firth, a strait in northern Scotland, had entered the start of its 25-year operations phase. The MeyGen scheme is the world’s largest tidal stream array but at 6MW of capacity is much smaller than the planned 320MW Swansea lagoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/147df4507932fe4c6843b395b9454f1390d9f86f/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641315815762bad40c21ea8ddedaa75b 700w","title":"i am evidence the shocking film on the truth about untested kits","story":"In a new documentary, two film-makers bring to life the stories of sexual assault survivors let down by a fractured system With more than 225,000 untested rape kits found shelved, untested in police stations, survivors find themselves waiting for justice decades after an attack that they spend lifetimes trying not to think about.HBO’s new documentary, I Am Evidence, brings these issues to the surface with the stories of four sexual assault survivors and the flimsy system built to respond to them. “To discard people’s experiences and their need for care and the need for justice was just so upsetting and we immediately wanted to go into overdrive to tell this story,” said Trish Adlesic, who directed the documentary with Geeta Gandbhir.The attacks on the four women who form the center of the documentary all occurred more than a decade ago, but the incidents are still fresh thanks in large part to lethargy in the criminal justice system. Danielle, who was raped in 1997, holds her baby while recounting the rape she has put in the background for nearly 20 years, explaining to an investigator that her attacker told her: “If you don’t shut up, I’ll beat your ass.” When the investigator brings out a photograph lineup of potential suspects, she picks the attacker out instantly. Then she learns that while his DNA has been tied to two other rapes, he is not yet in police custody. The systemic apathy towards testing these kits, paired with surveillance footage of other attacks and one particularly frustrating scene of a woman being questioned in a courtroom about what she was wearing when she was attacked, underlines that this crisis developed because of how society sees women. Several people explain that had the system worked as it should, the rape of one of the women featured in the documentary, Amberley, would have been prevented. In 1998, Amberley was abducted and raped in Ohio, two years after the same rapist raped and abducted a 17-year-old in California who had immediately had a rape kit done. Michelle Brettin, the retired Ohio police officer who investigated Amberley’s case, said if every rape kit in the country were tested, she expected the DNA from Amberley’s rapist would turn up in other cases. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they found a body attached to it,” Brettin said. Despite the overwhelming nature of the problem, which sees someone in the US sexually assaulted every 98 seconds, the women interviewed cut an inspiring image of resilience and bravery.“The film is really dedicated to the people most affected by the issue, which is the survivors,” said Adlesic. “We’re here to help change this but we really wanted their voice to be the voice of the film, and it is.”Adlesic produced the documentary with Mariska Hargitay, who played Olivia Benson on Law \u0026amp Order: Special Victims Unit, a character who advocated for survivors and had herself been sexually assaulted. Hargitay is an advocate for sexual assault victims in part because people would write to her about their abuse stories after seeing Law \u0026amp Order. “At first it was a few, then it was more, then it was hundreds, then it was thousands,” she says in the documentary.Hargitay appears briefly in the film to spotlight Detroit’s efforts to respond to the backlog.Viewers see another glimmer of hope in Ohio, where officials have acknowledged their failure to test kits and are seen working to improve the entire system, not just clear out the untested kits.“For every story, there is hope to it because it was what was organically happening on the ground,” said Gandbhir. She explained that they had interviewed 14 survivors for the film, but decided to focus on four women in the editing process, using their stories to also explain what was happening in the three states featured in the film: California, Ohio and Michigan. “We would have loved to feature every single person because every single story could have been its own movie,” said Gandbhir. The documentarians have also created an infrastructure around the film to encourage people to check on their local rape kit backlogs. Because of the momentum around clearing the backlogs, and improving how the criminal justice system responds to these crimes, hundreds of watch parties are being held across the US for the documentary premiere on 16 April. One of those parties is being held in Detroit by a key figure in the film, Ericka Murria. She said a party meant for just her family has swelled to include 700 guests. Murria reveals in the documentary that until agreeing to appear in the film, she had for 12 years kept secret that she was raped on her 21st birthday.Murria inspired the documentary’s title when she explained in an interview what it meant to have the rape kit sitting untested in an office for more than a decade. Murria said: “I am evidence, literally. My name is on a box, on a shelf that’s never been tested.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7edcdd0d72e927bd29a22fc6c69452c208801ca2/0_165_5448_3268/master/5448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8b63bcb19564114f671d067efc5f2a1b 1240w","title":"champions league draw liverpool real madrid roma bayern munich semi finals","story":"Jürgen Klopp has said Roma’s defeat of Barcelona and reaction to losing key players such as Mohamed Salah last summer are the marks of an “outstandingly good” side that Liverpool will not under-estimate in the Champions League semi-finals.Liverpool will host Eusebio Di Francesco’s team at Anfield in the last four on 24 April before visiting Stadio Olimpico, scene of their European Cup triumphs in 1977 and 1984, for the second leg on 2 May. Friday’s draw pitted the bookmakers’ favourites, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, together in the other semi-final but Klopp admits Roma’s remarkable comeback against Barcelona on Tuesday should serve as a warning to his team.The Liverpool manager said: “Of the three options that were available I’ve never played there before so that is already exciting. It will be two difficult games. Roma are a fantastic side as you saw against Barcelona. They played a very good season after a difficult transfer window for them last summer. They lost Mo, Ederson and other key players but still they played a really good season and are fighting for the Champions League again. When we face Roma we will know everything about them. I saw the second leg against Barcelona and they were outstandingly good.”Salah will face his former club for the first time since joining Liverpool for £36.9m last summer. The Egypt international’s stunning debut season with Klopp’s team has prompted inevitable speculation that he will be a target for one of Europe’s wealthiest clubs this summer. That may be the case, but the Liverpool manager is adamant his leading goalscorer will be an Anfield employee next season.“It’s not a situation I would even think about it,” said Klopp. “Around nine months ago he came in to make the next step in his career and he did it. He had different options and he wanted to come to Liverpool. If we now always start talking after one year of ‘Will he leave?’ or whatever then I don’t think about.“Yes, I’m confident. I know he will be here. That’s all. We don’t want to change all the time. We have a big chance here to create something for the future. In the moment we have to deliver performances, collecting points, winning. The age group of the team is really good. We are still young and full of potential and all that stuff. My impression at the moment is that they are all excited about being in this group.”The final will take place in Kiev at the end of May but the Scotland defender, Andrew Robertson, insists Liverpool will not fear any opposition.“This club has been here before and they know how hard it is – regardless of who you are playing – to get to the final and try to win this trophy,” Robertson said. “We know how hard it’s going to be and we need to try and work so hard to get to the final because we need to deserve it.”The Roma sporting director has challenged his players to channel the same spirit that they did against Barça on Tuesday.“It feels like a great opportunity to chase the joy that we were not able to experience so many years ago,” Monchi said. “But of course it will be difficult because Liverpool are an extremely strong side. We need to think about ourselves, and try to reproduce what we were able to show against Barcelona.”The other semi-final will be between European heavyweights Bayern Munich and holders Real Madrid, who needed a dramatic stoppage-time penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo to see off Juventus after the Italian outfit had come back from 3-0 down in the first leg to level the tie. “It’s one of European football’s top clashes,” said Bayern’s departing manager, Jupp Heynckes. “It’s the defending champions against a top side with quality players.”The first legs will be played on 2425 April, with the second legs on 12 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce984fd6c8f78f3b0303ff056fdb91cb9236532e/0_135_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8dc0d5cdf0f0d2a19a3ea357c12c1965 1240w","title":"jay bothroyd more goals than gary lineker in japan","story":"As Jay Bothroyd settles into his 18th season as a professional he has already achieved everything he set out to do as a child chasing a ball around the playground. Now, however, he wants to create history in Japan. The striker plays for Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo in the country where he has spent the past three years of his career and has started brightly this season with two goals in his opening five league games.It looked as if Bothroyd was heading away from top-level football when he left England in 2014 for the Thai club Muangthong United but the low standard he found there prompted the former Cardiff striker to force his way out, moving to the J-League 2 side Júbilo Iwata. Bothroyd became a favourite with the club as he propelled them back up to the top flight, something which helped him to settle easily into Japanese life.“I always look back, not that I’ve got any plans on finishing soon, but when I do retire from football I can look back at my career and say that when I decided I wanted to be a professional footballer in the playground when I was an infant I would have said: ‘I wanted to play in the Premier League, I want to play for my country and I want to earn a lot of money’ and I’ve done all three of those. I’ve achieved all my goals and I want to keep achieving as much as I can for as long as I can.”Bothroyd, 35, is still looking to better himself and finally lift a trophy, something he has not done since being part of the Arsenal team which won the FA Youth Cup in 2000. Triumph in Japan would increase his cult status in Sapporo and send Bothroyd down in history, a personal milestone for which he is striving. “I would like to be the first English person to win some silverware in Japan, that would be a big achievement for me. I am happy, I’m the highest‑scoring British person in the J-League ever and Gary Lineker was here, so that’s an achievement. I just want to keep trying to be the best I can be, work hard, keep myself in shape and enjoy each day.”Back home not many have taken notice of Bothroyd’s achievements abroad but he recently made headlines in England for blacking out in a training session. “I’ve got epilepsy, I haven’t got it really badly but I do have epilepsy and it’s something I’ve had since I was young, so it’s just one of those things you learn to live with.“That was the first time I’ve actually had a seizure in football on the pitch, it had never happened to me before. The reason it did happen is because I forgot to take my medication for a couple of days and it caught up with me. I’ve got to take medication each day, I don’t see it as a disease, I see it as a condition and I embrace it. When that happened to me, loads of people contacted me and sent letters to say they didn’t realise you could be a sportsperson, achieve your goals with the condition. People were saying they were going to let their kids play football again, so I’ve helped influence people in a positive light.”Asia is not Bothroyd’s first foreign adventure. He spent two years at the Italian club Perugia from the age of 20, fulfilling an ambition cultivated every weekend watching Football Italia on the sofa with his father growing up in Islington, north London.One of his team-mates in Serie A was Colonel Gaddafi’s son Saadi, a man who became a friend of Bothroyd’s during their time at the club. Gaddafi failed a drug test while with the club and would feature only once. In recent years he has faced a number of accusations including murder, drug use, misappropriating properties through force and armed intimidation when he led the Libyan Football Federation. After football he became a special forces commander and was under United Nations sanctions after commanding units to repress the revolution in his homeland brutally and is being held in prison awaiting trial for the murder and torture of a former footballer.“I never experienced that side of Saadi,” says Bothroyd. “Maybe he does what he does in his country but when he was in Italy I never experienced the treachery that his father and brothers did. He loved football. When his people and his security were around him, he was always polite and respectful to everyone. When I saw all the stuff come out about him and his family, it was shocking to me.”Japanese football is on the up and the fans will be confident of progression from a World Cup group comprising Poland, Senegal and Colombia in June. Bothroyd has seen the improvements of the domestic league since his arrival, not to mention the growing influence of Japanese players in Europe.Bothroyd’s own international career consists of 18 minutes in a 2-1 friendly defeat by France in November 2010. As now, the striker was going against popular theory by earning his senior England call when playing in the Championship for Cardiff City, becoming the club’s first England international. There is no sense of regret with Bothroyd, who had to brush off the disappointment of never representing his country again.“I got my England call-up which was great. People can say ‘one cap wonder’ but at the end of the day there aren’t many people who can say they got one cap, so I’m proud of it. I was unfortunate. Stuart Pearce came to watch me at training at the time and I was meant to go to another squad but I got injured, so it just didn’t go my way. But that’s life.”Lineker’s time in Japan in the early 1990s was quickly forgotten by those who witnessed it but now Bothroyd has the chance to be remembered in the country he has made his home. He does not care that he could not compete with Lineker at international level. Bothroyd knows there are a number of different ways to make history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf23bc21a9fba4d01c4c10f5cf01fd0e1c04816/0_153_4580_2748/master/4580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fa8e7cd82147da0189fad9120aa13d7c 1240w","title":"champions league semi final draw live","story":"Liverpool have been handed a semi-final against Roma, while Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich face Real Madrid in the last fourLiverpool will need to overcome Serie A side Roma over two legs if they are to prevail to the Champions League final in Kiev at the end of May.

For Mohamed Salah, the Liverpool forward, it will be a return to Rome, where he scored 29 goals in 65 league appearances before moving on last summer. In the other tie, Real Madrid will take on Bayern Munich, who they knocked out of the quarter-finals last season. The first leg will take place at the Allianz Arena, with the second at the Bernabéu. Bayern, who, on Friday confirmed Niko Kovac will succeed manager Jupp Heynckes in the dugout in July, are targeting another treble under the 72-year-old.

They will play the first leg at Anfield before a date in Rome, at the mammoth Stadio Olimpico. A Roma reunion for Mo Salah, too.The other tie?

Jürgen Klopp’s men will also play the first of two legs at home.The Bundesliga champions will face Real, and will play the first leg at the Allianz Arena. That’s going to be some match-up. That’s a repeat of last season’s quarter-final.Here we go ... with Shevchenko’s wise words that “anything can happen” the last soundbite before he plunges into the hats.An email, a question for you to ponder while Andriy Shevchenko rocks up on stage in Nyon to get the draw, and party, started. “Given Arsenal were given the toughest possible draw in the semis,” says Simon. “I’d like to ask The Guardian readership, is it better to face a top side over two legs or in a one off in the final? I’d go one off in the final.” Some breaking news coming out of one our semi-finalists: Bayern Munich have announced that Niko Kovac will take over as the club’s new manager from 1 July, after agreeing a three-year contract on Thursday. So, there we go. Heynckes will depart, as originally planned, perhaps off the back of a treble and Kovac will enter. The 46-year-old, a former midfielder at Bayern, is currently in charge at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga, that being his first job in club management.The mayor of Kiev, the one and only Vitali Klitschko – that’s right – is out on the stage to give a whimsical presentation about how the Ukrainian capital has transformed into a sporting hub, for this year at least. He’s wearing glasses, and looks a changed man himself from the one we’ve seen in the ring. “Kiev is a beautiful city, especially in spring, especially beautiful in May,” he muses. “Welcome.” Superb. Here we go ... kick-off is upon us in Nyon, Switzerland. Just the formalities, pleasantries and a flurry of quarter-final montages to get through. While we wait, a reminder that the final takes place in Kiev, on Saturday 26 May at the Olimpiyskyi Stadium.This is Real Madrid’s eighth successive Champions League semi-final. Not bad, eh? They squeezed through this time, at least. As for Liverpool, the last time they reached this stage was in 2008, when they lost to Chelsea over two legs. As for Roma, they have not been this far since 1984, when, believe it or not, Dundee United were the opposition. Bayern, meanwhile, have plenty of pedigree when it comes to breezing into the last four – but not last year, when Real beat them in the quarter-finals.With six minutes to go until the get-go in Nyon, some people are just tempting fate. “It feels like I’ve played Real Madrid thousands of times in my career, so if it’s them it’s fine,” Mats Hummels, the Bayern defender muses. “That said, the other opponents would be more interesting: I’ve only played Liverpool once, and never against Roma.”Another thing that you ought to be doing in the meantime is signing up to The Fiver. If you haven’t already, you are missing out on your tea-timely football fix:While we’re waiting to get under way – we’re expecting kick-off in less than 20 minutes – soak back into your armchair, and lap up this European treat:The Liverpool defender, Andy Robertson, has had his two-pennies’ worth about who wants who. “I don’t think we have a preference,” he trilled. “This club has been here before and they know how hard it is – regardless of who you are playing – to get to the final and try to win this trophy. We know how hard it’s going to be and we need to try and work so hard to get to the final because we need to deserve it.” As for Trent Alexander-Arnold, the 19-year-old reckons him and his team-mates are fearless:The good news? Andriy Shevchenko and Wladimir Klitschko are both in the house in Nyon, with the Champions League semi-final draw almost upon us. With the Europa League draw out of the way, all eyes move to this, where Liverpool, Roma, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid all await their fate.The road to Kiev has narrowed, with just four teams remaining in the semi-finals. Liverpool, Roma, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich await their fate in Nyon, with the draw set to get under way around 12pm. We will get started shortly.

After a patient build-up, 2017 was such a breakthrough year for the bewitching London-born singer – selling over a million copies of her self-titled debut album and cruising past some of the world’s biggest pop stars to be crowned the most-streamed female artist in the UK – that she could probably take a few months off. But Lipa has continued her vertiginous career ascent in 2018, claiming two Brit awards in February, teaming up with dancefloor genie Calvin Harris for sleek new club banger One Kiss and insouciantly cracking a billion YouTube views for New Rules, her signature hit that warns against backsliding into a lousy relationship with a stern but moreish checklist-style mantra.While impressive on paper, racking up record-breaking streaming stats can sometimes feel like an intangible, almost passive form of success. But Lipa’s industrious workrate and gruelling tour schedule (including a stint supporting Coldplay) have clearly brought palpable real-world benefits. When she last played Glasgow six months ago it was in a crammed 2,500-capacity venue. Now she is packing them to the rafters in a giant arena bowl made for 13,000. Her core fanbase skews young and female but while the screams are as loud and piercing as at any Bieber show, the crowd seem keen to reflect back some of Lipa’s worldly sophistication. Compared to most full-bore pop gigs at the Hydro, there is a distinct lack of strobing deely boppers.On magazine covers and in impeccably styled promo shots, Lipa often looks aloof or simply nonplussed. But the 22-year-old kicks off by imploring fans to “be your most unapologetic you” and “dance the night away”, and promptly leads by example through Blow Your Mind (Mwah), a slice of futuristic disco that slyly incorporates an actual kiss-off into its chorus. For sustained stretches of her 90-minute show, Lipa is in perpetual motion, bouncing and reeling round the stage in billowing black joggers, springy trainers and aquamarine bra. She is flanked by four equally tireless dancers while her long-serving backing trio of a drummer and two multitasking keyboardguitarists jam away atop oversized stage cubes.A massive projection screen showing artfully stylised visuals and pulsing hyperspace starfields is arena-show standard but otherwise there is a distinct lack of large-scale staging gimmicks. It makes it all the more impressive that Lipa is able to sustain so many winningly jazzercise-style dance routines without missing a note.There are moments of delirious communion, as when Lipa hoists herself up on the front-row stage barrier to conduct a singalong to the yearning Be the One. But there are also moments of spine-tingling spotlight: the stripped-down obsessional ballad Thinking ’Bout You, with just her and guitar, showcases her voice at its smokiest. Strip away the headstrong beats and synthy stabs of her biggest hits and Lipa would remain a potent, intuitive torch singer.The biggest laugh of the night comes toward the end when a title card pops up dedicating IDGAF to “all the fuckboys who have done you wrong”. While this playground-chant anthem to empowerment doesn’t yet match the climactic New Rules in terms of streams and views, it is – perhaps tellingly – the song fans are raucously singing a capella as they spill out of the venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ba2ed8014e651ccc183ff09fe81b019fb9f4709/57_85_4433_2660/master/4433.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=48f289d1699fd9669f68d49410d84912 1240w","title":"chinese grand prix lewis hamilton under pressure ferrari","story":"Fine margins make the difference in Formula One and, gratifyingly for the Chinese Grand Prix, the differential at the front of the grid can barely be measured. A season that started with much tighter competition between Ferrari and Mercedes than anticipated has every sign of being impossible to call in Shanghai but, unusually given how strong they have been for the past four seasons, it is Mercedes who are having to fine-tune their focus to meet Ferrari’s threat.Lewis Hamilton did top the time sheets for Mercedes in first practice but, when the leaders ran qualifying simulations in practice two, there was nothing in it. As scene-setters for the race go this was a mighty opening, with one-tenth of a second separating the front four.Hamilton again was quickest but only 0.007sec ahead of Kimi Räikkönen’s Ferrari. The British driver suffered a slight oversteer in the final corner but then the Finn also lost a fraction passing a Sauber. There was nothing between them and little behind. Valtteri Bottas in the second Mercedes was three-hundredths back with Sebastian Vettel one-tenth down.Hamilton’s qualifying form in Shanghai is incomparable he has pole\u0026nbspsix times from 11 meetings but with margins this fine, nothing is a given. The British driver needs one of his best performances and now more than ever. After Vettel won the first two rounds, he leads Hamilton by 17\u0026nbsppoints\u0026nbspin the world championship. Lowering the gap is crucial \u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspHamilton believes it can be done.“I arrived here thinking I want to win the next 19 races, the title is not won and lost in two races,” he said. “The experiences of the last two grands prix strengthen you but I definitely don’t want to fall any further behind. I feel hungry, we are not a wounded beast, and I still believe we are the best team with the potential to win races and fight for this world championship.”Yet Mercedes have work to do. In Australia a software problem cost Hamilton a likely win. In Bahrain a grid penalty set him back from the off and third was a good result. But his race was marred by problems with radio communication, revealed this week by Mercedes’ race engineer, Andrew Shovlin, to have been caused by the microphones being out of position in Hamilton’s balaclava.Equally the team seem to have suffered some in-race conservatism. In Australia Hamilton did not push because they believed they had the pace required. In Bahrain Bottas failed to catch Vettel at the death, again having not pushed as hard as he might early in the race, when the team thought they had a strategic margin over Ferrari. A more aggressive outlook may have to be adopted.These are the tiny margins that may define this season and they are noticeable given that Mercedes’ dominance of the turbo-hybrid era has been marked by a team executing every aspect of racing almost flawlessly. Their success has been hard-earned but this year there is no room for complacency. A win in China would be the kick-start they need but it will clearly not be easy.“Ferrari are going to be hard to beat here,” Hamilton said. “It is a good track for us but it will be closer than you think so we need to bring our A-game every weekend.”Ferrari in contrast have implemented Vettel’s opening two races perfectly and the Scuderia are firmly on the front foot. The course of the season will ebb and flow according to characteristics of circuits but they are in no mood to relinquish their advantage in Shanghai.“We are happy for the results we have but we know that the season will be long,” said the team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene. “In China we will see Mercedes and Red Bull quite strong but we are not here to surrender.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0366a5af59be229bfbf9f2387920ab6936e4234b/0_320_5214_3130/master/5214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3e248df3fae14f08001a66242d52c9fc 1240w","title":"kaepernick reid blackballed nfl kneeling anthem","story":"Kaepernick and comrade-in-arms Eric Reid have again been denied employment due to their anthem protest, further proof that for the NFL’s owners it’s simply a matter of powerAs if there were any doubt that the NFL was going to continue its blacklist against Colin Kaepernick, the former Super Bowl starting quarterback was once again denied an opportunity this week. This time, it was in Seattle, and there was none of the hemming and hawing about Kaepernick’s numbers not being good enough or his playstyle not being the right fit for the offense. No, instead, an NFL source told ESPN’s Adam Schefter that Seahawks officials cancelled Kaepernick’s workout after he refused to commit to ending his kneeling protests during the national anthem during the 2018 season.This comes just days after Kaepernick’s former teammate, Pro Bowl safety Eric Reid – the first 49ers player to join Kaepernick in his protest in 2016 – was approaching a contract with the Cincinnati Bengals only to be confronted by team owner Mike Brown, who asked him to commit not to kneel during the anthem in 2018. After going through a series of workouts with coaches and sensing interest, Reid was again confronted, this time by Bengals coach Marvin Lewis. Lewis asked Reid if he wished to clarify his stance on anthem kneeling for ownership. Reid declined, and the meeting was over shortly thereafter. Reid, like Kaepernick, remains unsigned.This should come as no surprise, particularly after Houston Texans owner Bob McNair came out and told the media he “regretted apologizing” for one of the most disgusting comments of the 2017 season, when McNair said at an owners meeting, “We can’t have the inmates running the prison.” McNair continues to claim he wasn’t actually referring to the players, but the context of the original report containing the quote, from Don Van Natta and Seth Wickersham of ESPN Magazine, suggests otherwise. The truth, though, is that the owners are not making business decisions when they refuse the services of men like Kaepernick and Reid. As Van Natta and Wickersham reported, the NFL’s major sponsors were not universally pro ban. In fact, at least one had threatened to drop its sponsorship of the league should it mandate the players to stand for the national anthem. If it was really about the bottom line, would the NFL have tried to buy out kneeling players for $100m in charitable contributions in 2017? Money makes football powerful, but so does its reach. No other sport dominates American culture and media like the gridiron, and while the NFL primarily exists to sell the product on the field, there can no doubt that the NFL also sells a very specific set of values every Sunday. As John Harbaugh summed up in his 2015 letter, Why Football Matters:After years, even decades of hearing such platitudes on NFL broadcasts and pre-game shows, it can be hard to recognize these values as political. But it is impossible to separate football’s demands of discipline and obedience from the way McNair, Jones and many of the NFL’s owners see on-field player activism. Thus, when even a player like Kaepernick – a quarterback who led his team to the Super Bowl at age 26, and one of the most physically talented players at the position – dared to say something is bigger than football, his continued presence became unacceptable. It’s why when Reid tried to land a job in Cincinnati, both the head coach and owner pressed him to commit not to kneel in 2018 before they would even consider a contract offer.It’s good, at least, that the owners have stopped bothering to pretend it’s about anything else but showing their power for the world – and for any players who might be considering a protest this season – to see. In a world where Colin Kaepernick remains unsigned but Harbaugh’s Baltimore Ravens found a place for Robert Griffin III, a quarterback with a wrecked knee and just 14 appearances, six touchdowns and nine interceptions to his name since 2014, any delusions about the blackball of Kaepernick having anything to do with the league’s product should be put to rest.The political statement McNair and the rest of the owners are trying to keep off the football field in their crusade against on-field activism is one America absolutely needs to hear. Systemic racism and police brutality are a daily reality for black Americans, and despite the NFL’s posturing, these issues are bigger than the game. And let’s not forget that it is not just people who are indignant over protests during the anthem who will stop watching football. For every person who blusters about quitting the league over the “anthem protests,” there will be others who see the owners’ cowardly attempts to stifle the speech and expression of the players and think twice about devoting their Sundays to a game with no soul.By kneeling for themselves and their brethren, Reid and Kaepernick have become a threat to the NFL. They don’t just threaten to sully the league’s image, to remind everybody watching at home and in the stands that the NFL is part of an America that brutally and systematically opresses black Americans. Kaepernick, Reid and anybody else who would dare kneel in 2018 also threaten the league’s ironclad grip on the values of obedience and discipline, and that is a threat that cannot be brooked by such small, angry men as Bob McNair, Dan Snyder and Jerry Jones. But Reid and Kaepernick will not submit, and for that crime, we should expect the NFL’s unofficial but blatantly obvious blackballing to continue through 2018, and, in all likelihood, beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"grand national 2018 a horse by horse betting guide","story":"We go through the 40 runners for the 2018 edition of the world’s most famous horse raceWon the Irish Grand National in 2015, beating Rule The World at level weights, form which looked pretty good when the runner-up won the next year’s Grand National. Has not won since and yet somehow remains 6lb higher than for his Fairyhouse success. Was not to blame for his jockey being knocked out of the saddle in this last year but harder to make excuses for his falls in his last two races, since he got about halfway up the fence on each occasion and was under no great pressure at the time. The ability is probably still in there somewhere.Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Has been useful and consistent around the northern tracks this winter but it’s hard to believe he has the class for this and his stamina seems to have been exposed by weak finishing efforts in his last two starts.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Ran on in eye-catching style to be eighth last year, having seemingly been given too much to do. Put up another fine effort when third in the Ladbrokes Trophy in December and warmed up for this by scoring at Ascot in February. Has taken years to build on his early promise but finally doing so and has it in him to land a major prize. Still on a fair weight and 4lb well in, as his Ascot win came after the weights were set.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Improved this season, winning comfortably at Ascot in November and running a fine third there the next month. Bad ground probably explains his Haydock flop in January and he’s presumably been freshened up since that most recent outing. May well have more to offer, though his stamina for this distance is in doubt.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e049305b94e9aed7a6894f49fb9f6ac372b6f79b/0_180_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f91d34130736b999502aecfa9153431a 480w","title":"google loses right to be forgotten case","story":"Businessman wins legal action to force removal of search results about past convictionA businessman has won his legal action to remove search results about a criminal conviction in a landmark “right to be forgotten” case that could have wide-ranging repercussions.The ruling was made by a judge, Mr Justice Mark Warby, in London on Friday. He rejected a similar claim brought by a second businessman who was jailed for a more serious offence. The claimant who lost, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s the claimant who won, known as NT2, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiracy to intercept communications. NT1 was jailed for four years, while NT2 was jailed for six months.Granting an appeal in the case of NT1, the judge added: “It is quite likely that there will be more claims of this kind, and the fact that NT2 has succeeded is likely to reinforce that.”Both men demanded that Google remove search results mentioning the cases for which they were convicted. These include links to web pages published by a national newspaper and other media. Google refused their request and the men took the company to the high court.The decision in NT2’s favour could have implications for other convicted criminals and those who want embarrassing stories about them erased from the web. The judge ruled out any damages payment, however.Explaining his decision, the judge said NT1 continued to mislead the public, whereas NT2 had shown remorse. He also took into account the submission that NT2’s conviction did not concern actions taken by him in relation to “consumers, customers or investors”, but rather in relation to the invasion of privacy of third parties.He said his key conclusion in relation to NT2’s claim was that “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability”. In the case of NT1, however, the judge was scathing in terms of the claimant’s position since leaving prison. “He has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters,” he said.“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimising the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.” In 2014 the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engine firms can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy.At a high court hearing in February, Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing NT1, told the high court that the visibility of the articles on the search engine caused “distress and upset” to his client.Tomlinson, who is also chairman of the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living on commercial lending and funding a property developer.“Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson said. He added that many people engaged in misdeeds when they were young and if the misdeeds were constantly brought to the attention of others then they would permanently have a negative effect.NT1’s conviction was now spent, Tomlinson continued, and the law was designed to allow for the rehabilitation of offenders so they could go on to lead normal lives.But Antony White QC, representing Google, argued the ECJ’s “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”.White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”.NT2, in a separate hearing, also argued that his conviction was legally spent and he therefore had a right to be forgotten. Google resisted taking down search results linking to articles including reports on his financial affairs, his conviction and interviews given by him several years later containing his account of the circumstances surrounding his conviction.A Google spokesperson said: “We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information. We are pleased that the court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.” "},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities. With so many options for fun in the sun, we take a look at some of the best.A full beach experience right on the Strip. Body surf in the wave pool, relax on a day bed, or take a gentle float down the lazy river. There are cabanas for all temperaments, whether you want seclusion or want to party. To really get away from the crowds, hire a cabana or gazebo with private pool and lounge area. The beach is family friendly, but head to the nearby Toptional Moorea club for a more grown-up experience.Mandalay Bay, 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd.No need to stop the party just because the sun is shining – Wet Republic supplies the beats, dipping pools and festive atmosphere for all-day clubbing. A-list DJs, including Calvin Harris, Tiësto and Kaskade, keep the party going while there are a range of VIP options — take a bungalow for privacy and a personal jacuzzi, or be right in the action and book a banquette by the dance floor.MGM Grand, 3799 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Pick a pool. Caesars Palace has seven to choose from, each with its own theme. They all feature cabanas and day beds, so be guided by your mood. The Apollo pool receives the most sunlight, while the Jupiter is more secluded. Gamers will like the Fortuna, which has a swim-up blackjack table, while those looking for a European vibe should head for the Venus pool lounge. For the ultimate in relaxation book a massage session with Qua Baths \u0026amp Spa, which offers poolside services.Caesars Palace, 3570 S. Las Vegas Blvd.The Wynn’s day life unfolds at the Encore, a beach club that centres around its three-tiered pools. The DJ talent is world class, with the likes of the Chainsmokers, David Guetta and Diplo on the roster. Comfy cabanas come with a lush day bed, TV (who’s watching TV with a party raging outside?) and stocked fridge. Bungalow residents get extra luxuries such as a cooling system, infinity pool and, crucially, a private bathroom.Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Just a half-hour’s drive from the Strip is Lake Mead, a recreation area known as the most erse in America. Visitors come for year-round activities, including jet skiing, paddleboarding, sport fishing and kayaking. There are a number of picnic spots throughout the park, and for a night away from the city’s hubbub, pitch a tent in one of the 10 campgrounds, or stay at one of the lakeside resorts.The Tank, as the Golden Nugget’s pool is called, can boast what no other can: here you can swim with sharks. Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E. Fremont StreetA visit to the Hoover Dam is on many a bucket list, but to really experience the magnificence of the structure hop in a kayak. As you paddle out into the Colorado River, you’ll have an epic view as the 220-metre (726-foot) dam looms above. A number of companies offer day or half-day tours that take in highlights of the Black Canyon, including sauna caves and geothermal hot springs. Desert bighorn sheep, falcons and bald eagles are some of the wildlife that you might spot.

Her killing has sparked an outpouring of reverence and revoltIt has been a month since the late-night knock at Mônica Benício’s door: a friend arriving to announce the love of her life was not coming home.“I ran at her shouting: ‘Where’s Marielle? Where’s Marielle?’” the 32-year-old architect recalled. “I screamed and I shouted. I smashed part of the house … None of it seemed real … It was like I was having a nightmare and would wake up at any moment. But as more and more friends arrived it became more and more real. More concrete. More desperate.”Less than two miles away, Marielle Franco, a 38-year-old activist and rising political star known for defending Rio’s black, LGBT and favela communities, lay slumped on the backseat of a white Chevrolet having been shot in the head four times as she returned from a debate in downtown Rio.Benício pummeled her friend with questions: “Was it an attempted robbery? Are they taking her to the doctor’s? Can they help her?”“No,” came the reply. “She was dead and there wasn’t … anything to be done.”Weeks after the murder of the Rio councillor and her driver, Anderson Gomes, her partner perched on a sofa in their home in north Rio and sobs as she relived the events of 14 March. Next year – after a 14-year, on-off romance – the couple were to marry.Symbols of the couple’s shared passion for activism and the arts pepper the airy lounge: murals of Frida Kahlo and Angela Davis records by politically charged composers such as Chico Buarque and Mercedes Sosa and contemporary black artists like Marina Iris and her group ÉPreta a portrait of Florestan Fernandes, a Brazilian sociologist who rose from poverty to write seminal works on race and democracy – issues central to Franco’s mission. Franco’s killing has sparked an outpouring of reverence and revolt. Brazilian newspapers are filled with stories about her life demonstrators have swarmed on to the streets to chant: “Marielle presente!” – Rio’s answer to “Je suis Charlie!”“There are two Marielles: the one we are all out on the streets shouting is alive and the Marielle who is my companion and who I still haven’t managed to mourn,” said Benício. “I still haven’t accepted this has happened.”At dawn on Saturday supporters will mark one month since Franco’s murder by decorating public squares with balloons, flowers and banners.Yet Franco’s killers, who many suspect belong to the increasingly powerful paramilitary groups that control swaths of Rio, have yet to be caught. Authorities claim progress is being made but have said little about the state of their inquiry. “We are advancing, but under strict secrecy,” said Homero Freitas Filho, a public prosecutor on a taskforce pursuing the killers.Franco’s murder has punctuated a dismal chapter in the contemporary history of this spectacular but troubled beach city.Almost a decade ago, the then president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who last week began a prison sentence for a disputed corruption conviction, wept with joy after Rio was chosen to host the 2016 Olympics. Since then, however, Brazil’s “Marvellous City” has tumbled into a whirlpool of overlapping crises – economic, political and security – from which it is struggling to emerge before October elections. “The government is coming to an end with the former governor under arrest the former president of the legislative assembly under arrest the other president of the legislative assembly under arrest the leader of the government under arrest and the current governor waiting to be arrested. This is a very serious metastasis and has a real impact in people’s lives. There is no government.” Benício, who met Franco in the colossal Maré favela where both women were raised, recalled teasing her about the wisdom of ing into this morass of political “filth”. But she said the seemingly endless reports of bloodshed and sleaze had fired up Franco, not discouraged her. Franco was convinced Brazilian politics needed renewal: more black faces, more female faces, more LGBT faces, more favela faces, and – with Brazil mired in what some call the biggest corruption scandal in history – more honest faces.In 2016, after years of grassroots activism, she ran for office with the slogan “I am because we are”. Freixo, Franco’s boss since 2007, said he was thrilled by his protege’s move: “The world is crying out for Marielles.” Rio agreed, electing Franco with nearly 47,000 votes – the fifth-highest number received by a city councillor. At her swearing in on 1 January 2017 the young, black, gay, female, favela-born politician vowed to “oxygenate” Rio’s stale political scene. Not everybody seems to have welcomed Franco’s triumph. Friends and relatives are convinced she was the victim of a political assassination, a theory authorities say they are aggressively pursuing. “I don’t question at all that it was a political crime,” said Benício. “She was our only black female councillor – a black, lesbian woman from the favelas occupying a position of power that’s predominantly reserved for the white men who make up this ‘Brazilian elite’.”Freixo, who has long lived under armed guard because of his fight against Rio’s mafia, agreed. “The only thing I don’t know is what politics lay behind it who ordered it what the motivation was and what the message was.”He admitted police faced a devilishly complex investigation. “We know this case won’t be solved with the speed … our anguish demands. But I think it will be solved.”Determined to keep Franco’s cause alive, Benício has thrown herself into public activism, addressing politicians in Brasília and taking to the stage with Lula and Katy Perry in Rio.She said her first task, however, was simply surviving. For a fortnight after the crime, Benício said, she was unable to consume solid food. “Eating meant accepting I would have to go on.” Benício said she clung to the memory of her final moments with Franco after a rare lunch together at her office. “I gave her a quick kiss, got into the lift – and the last image I have,” she said, pausing to compose herself, “is of her stood there in the door, smiling and waving goodbye, and the lift door closing.”The next time she set eyes on her partner was through a small glass window in Franco’s redwood coffin. “It didn’t look like her … Her face was a little swollen but there was nothing grotesque or morbid. It’s just that I couldn’t see my woman in that face … So I still can’t believe it.”“I’m waiting for her to come back,” Benício admitted, her voice trembling. “Any time now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df32db21fbd773935c4414445f0fd2b6f1a74bd/266_506_3462_2077/master/3462.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=46caeb4f8af9ea2372af98c46c3a39bb 1240w","title":"may urged to clear mondays commons diary for syria debate","story":"Tory backbenchers press PM to cancel parliament business for vote on interventionTheresa May is under increasing pressure from her own backbenchers to cancel Monday’s business in parliament to make time for a full-scale debate and vote on intervention in Syria.“The government owes it to parliament to come and explain,” said Bob Seely, the Isle of Wight Conservative MP who says he is sceptical about intervention. “Articulating their case in a chamber full of critical voices is good for the government. If it can’t, then maybe it shouldn’t be doing it.”Tory backbenchers fear that if May approves a military strike without parliamentary support and it goes wrong, perhaps through civilian casualties or the loss of a British plane, she could jeopardise her minority government.Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, said on Friday: “If it all goes terribly wrong then the government will be in difficulties. It will then have chucked at it that it hasn’t consulted parliament.“The pressure on government to hold a debate in government time is going to become overwhelming. It has to be reasonable and take parliament into its confidence. Parliament can’t just be left sitting on the sidelines.”The veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke is also demanding a debate.Although the government is entitled under the royal prerogative to decide to go to war, since the debate on Iraq in 2003 there has been a convention that no administration would embark on military action without getting the support of parliament. Grieve said there was no legal basis for a punitive raid to deter the Syrian regime from repeating what he called its “flagrant breach” of the international convention banning chemical weapons – except under the doctrine of humanitarian necessity. That is the UN convention on the responsibility to protect, agreed in 2005, which was the basis of Cameron’s unsuccessful appeal to parliament over Syrian intervention in 2013. Some parliamentarians say the contentious status of international law, if combined with the lack of parliamentary support, would seriously weaken May.The Liberal Democrats’ defence spokesman and former leader, Menzies Campbell, said: “What if she loses a plane? Or something else goes wrong? She really will be in a very difficult position. I don’t see how she could survive that.”Downing Street is said to be confident that it could win a vote on intervention, unlike Cameron, who wanted to take military action that was “legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives”. But No 10 is understood to be concerned that it cannot delay if the US and France are ready to act in the wake of the chemical attack on Douma last weekend in which as many as 75 people, including children, may have died.If the government does not offer a debate, both Labour and the Scottish National party are planning to demand that the Speaker, John Bercow, grants one on Tuesday. The Commons business this week is dominated by one small piece of legislation to do with road safety.“A statement in parliament will not be sufficient,” the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said. “It would be wholly unforgivable. This is a minority government. We’re not talking about a threat to the UK. It would reflect very badly on the prime minister and the government if they take action without parliament being able to have a say.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37361bf174f25547edfc8c5daff77dc2dbd6f934/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70efd2143d4ca1eb1455505ddc3af593 1240w","title":"uk gypsy camp review criticised for fuelling prejudice","story":"Human rights groups say government has failed to address shortage of sites for TravellersLeading human rights groups have criticised a government review of the laws surrounding unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller camps for reinforcing prejudice against nomadic communities, after the death of Henry Vincent brought national focus to the tensions between travellers and nearby communities in the UK.Vincent, who was fatally stabbed during an altercation after he broke into the home of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks, reportedly belonged to the Traveller community near Hither Green, south-east London. Flowers and cards laid in tribute to Vincent outside Osborn-Brooks’ house have been repeatedly torn down and replaced. One resident shouted: “These are scumbags, scumbags, scumbags. We’ve had enough in this country of scumbags,” as he demolished the shrine. Last week the housing minister, Dominic Raab, announced a consultation on the powers available to local authorities, the police and landowners to deal with Gypsies and Travellers who settle on land without permission. The announcement came following calls by MPs in October for increased eviction powers.In a letter to Raab, organisations including Liberty, the Race Equality Foundation and the British Institute of Human Rights criticised the government for failing to focus on the root cause of the problem – the shortage of sites provided by local authorities for Gypsies and Travellers.The letter’s signatories, which also include leading Gypsy and Traveller groups, expressed concern that the review and the questions chosen to guide the consultation process would “reinforce and further anti-Gypsyism sweeping across Europe”. They said increased eviction powers could worsen health and educational inequalities for Gypsies and Travellers, which are already among the worst for any group in the UK.In a statement announcing the consultation last week, Raab said: “The vast majority of the travelling community are decent and law-abiding people. But we are particularly concerned about illegal Traveller encampments, and some of the antisocial behaviour they can give rise to. We must promote a tolerant society and make sure there are legal sites available for Travellers, but equally, the rule of law must be applied to everyone.”Gypsy and Traveller bodies have argued that there is already enough legislation to tackle anti-social behaviour from any person, whether they are in the travelling or settled communities. Michelle Gavin, the projects manager at FFT, said the government announcement had chosen to focus on anti-social behaviour by a small number of people rather than “local authorities’ nationwide failure to identify land for Traveller sites”.“The vast majority of Gypsies and Travellers who are living on unauthorised land are not doing this because they want to,” she said. “Would you want to live in a public space with next to no privacy? Would you want to get regularly evicted? Would you want to be the subject of press articles about ‘Traveller invasions’?”She added: “It is a disgrace that in 2018, so many Gypsy and Traveller families cannot access a site to live on and therefore cannot access basic water and sanitation and often experience uninterrupted access to education and healthcare.”Jim Davis, the manager of the equality and social unit at the Traveller Movement, said the language used in the announcement was “criminalising the vulnerable”. “Raab talks about illegal encampments and the undertone of that is that this is criminal activity,” he said. “It’s not a criminal activity. These people are homeless. If you had people sleeping in a doorway would you call them an illegal sleeper? Of course you wouldn’t.”Abiline McShane, a 51-year-old Romany Gypsy living in Birmingham, used to make her living running a bouncy castle at fairs across the country during the summer, and selling rugs in winter. That changed in 2012 when her then-six-year-old daughter Leyla Grace fell from a 12ft landing on to a concrete floor and fractured her skull. As Birmingham city council couldn’t provide her with a site to put her trailer on, she set up an unauthorised encampment close to a hospital to focus on getting treatment for her daughter’s brain injury. She was evicted from the site after a year and given a council house in the Yardley Wood area, with a drive to put her trailer on. “That’s not my home,” she says, sitting at the table in her caravan and pointing to the house. “This is my home.”McShane expected to be in the house for only six months before finding a bay for her trailer in a council-run camp, but five years later she is still there. “We’re not asking for special treatment. They give people council houses. Why can’t they just give us a space on a camp? It’s cheaper to build a space on a camp than it is to build a council house.”She was furious to read about the government consultation on unauthorised encampments. “If it was any other community then they would call this racist, but because it’s us, no one even bats an eyelid,” she says. She says has had abuse shouted at her and stones thrown at her windows, and that if more camps aren’t built, community tensions will only get worse.McShane says her ancestors left India in the 1500s and that her family has been in the UK for hundreds of years. “We are the original migrants,” she says. “We’re still compromising our way of life by living on camps. If we had it our way, we’d be living by streams and under trees. But they won’t even give us the camps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918189e4c4aae12694eff13d906efe8250826e89/0_0_5297_3178/master/5297.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60b8a75d825ac8d79907a3dc0cdd37aa 10500w","title":"wine tasting and karl marx lookalikes fridays photo highlights","story":"Our picture editors choose the best photos from the past 24 hours, including Hindu deities and Ladies Day at the Grand National"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Bernadette Flynn claimed she hurt her wrist and hip and afterwards had difficulties with domestic activitiesFormer Garda head told McCarthy of \u0026lsquosexual offence allegations\u0026rsquo against McCabeNow 30-year-old man claimed he was physically and sexually abused in foster careThe 55m structure affords the best man-made views of Dublin cityMinister for Education says child protection issues at organisation need to be addressedLouis was found in a \u0026lsquofrozen and traumatised state\u0026rsquo by a local man who brought him to vetBinyamin Netanyahu criticises M\u0026iacuteche\u0026aacutel Mac Donncha for taking part in \u0026lsquoanti-Israel\u0026rsquo conferenceBeautician Alicia Mikielewska (26) told court friends feared she was dead after incidentF\u0026oacutersa predicts major surge in demand for tests on foot of new Road Traffic Bill\u0026lsquoWe spend our careers helping the disadvantaged... but when we retire, we become disadvantaged ourselves\u0026rsquoMan, in his mid-40s, seen in difficulty in water at Salthill on Thursday afternoonMary Crilly says \u0026lsquoit\u0026rsquos not an isolated incident in terms of how some young boys view girls\u0026rsquoCarbon emissions from Irish homes almost 60 per cent higher than EU averageZappone says organisation\u0026rsquos handling of rape allegation is \u0026lsquovery concerning\u0026rsquoUCD-TCD science team disagree with \u0026lsquopessimistic\u0026rsquo DNA-test findings of expert groupSmall bone samples can reveal identities of mother-and-baby-home remainsForensic DNA analysis must be pursued, says the Tuam Babies Family Group\u0026lsquoConduct issues\u0026rsquo of players raised during Belfast rape trial is part of \u0026lsquointernal review\u0026rsquoGovernment report says increased costs mean any higher is less appealing to developersGermany wants to avoid even \u0026lsquoa glimmer\u0026rsquo of a hard border emerging in IrelandThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3460020.1523612445!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster rugby and irfu officials under pressure from sponsors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Jackson was cleared of the charges on March 28th. Photograph: PacemakerUlster Rugby and IRFU officials are coming under increasing pressure from sponsors to effectively deal with “issues” raised during the trial of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding. Official Ulster Rugby shirt sponsor Bank of Ireland (BoI) has said it is “highly concerned” about the “serious behaviour and conduct issues” that emerged in the trial involving the two players, who, at Belfast Crown Court last month, were cleared of raping the same woman in 2016.The bank, a key sponsor of the club for 20 years, has been in touch with Ulster Rugby chief executive Shane Logan regarding the case.“It is of paramount importance to Bank of Ireland that our sponsorship activity aligns with and supports our core values, and reflects positively on Bank of Ireland through association,” a BoI statement said. “We understand that an internal review is under way. We expect this review to be robust, to fully address the issues raised, and that decisions will be taken – and policies and protocols be put in place – that fully address the issues that have arisen.”Following the conclusion of the trial on March 28th when both men were cleared of all charges, and two of their friends were also acquitted on related charges, Ulster and the IRFU said they were conducting an internal review into the two players who have been “relieved of all duties” since the legal process began. The degrading and offensive WhatsApp messages exchanged between the players and their friends, including another rugby player Craig Gilroy, who is also subject to the internal review over a message he sent Mr Olding, were under intense scrutiny during the trial and since its conclusion.Street demonstrations have taken place in cities across Ireland, and a feminist protest planned for outside Ulster’s King Stadium in south Belfast is scheduled for Friday evening. King, which is headquartered in Cavan, is the main sponsor of Ulster Rugby. It has been a partner since 1999 and in the summer of 2014 announced a 10-year agreement for the naming rights of the stadium. A spokesman for the company did not respond to a number requests for a statement. A spokeswoman for main kit sponsor Kukri Sports said: “I have no comment.”A spokeswoman for another official shirt sponsor, BT, said: “As a sponsor of the team, we have been in contact with Ulster Rugby. “We note that the players concerned will continue to be relieved of all duties while the IRFU and Ulster Rugby internal review is under way, and we await the findings.”A spokesman for shirt sponsor Go Power said: “Our legal team have been liaising with their PR department.” All other “official” or “domestic” sponsors listed on the Ulster Rugby website were contacted by The Irish Times on Thursday. SONI (System Operator for Northern Ireland) spokeswoman Natasha Sayee said its concerns had been expressed to Ulster Rugby and it awaited the outcome of the review. “As sponsors of the Ulster Rugby Premiership, we seek to support the values of respect, integrity and inclusivity at community and grassroots level,” she said. “It is vital to SONI that the outcome of the review addresses all of these issues.”Danske Bank is the official sponsor of the Ulster Schools’ Cup competition held each year from November to March, plus the Girls Schools’ Cup and High Schools’ Trophy. A statement said: “Danske Bank has not taken a formal position on the matter, nor have we had any contact with Ulster Rugby.”A Moy Park spokeswoman said: “The company is an official supplier to Ulster Rugby. It would be inappropriate to comment further as Ulster Rugby and the IRFU are conducting an internal review.”A Dale Farm spokeswoman said: “Dale Farm fully respects Ulster Rugby and IRFU’s current internal investigation and as such is not in a position to comment on this matter.”An Ulster Carpets spokeswoman said: “Ulster Carpets are fully aware of the situation and will be awaiting the outcome of the review being carried out by Ulster Rugby and the IRFU before making any comment.”An Abbey Insurance spokeswoman said: “Thank you for the opportunity, but at this stage Abbey Insurance is not making any comment in relation to this matter.”A Deep River Rock spokeswoman said it would not be commenting on this matter. A Maxol spokesperson said: “Maxol sponsors the Ulster Mini Rugby Festivals programme which aims to give young players aged 6 - 12 years old their first taste of the sport as well as learning the basic skills that go behind it. On other matters we don’t feel it is appropriate to comment at this time.”A response from the following companies was not available at the time of publication: Subway Ernst and Young Bavarian A\u0026ampL Goodbody Tobermore Concrete Products Ltd Fonacab Argento CD Group Heineken Millar McCall Wylie First Trust Bank and Kerr’s Tyres.An Ulster Rugby statement said: “The IRFU and Ulster Rugby have advised that a review process in relation to this matter is underway and it would be inappropriate to comment on any matter pertaining to that process until it is completed.”In the “sponsorship opportunities” section of the Ulster Rugby website it says it and the IRFU Ulster Branch are “committed to building a team from grass roots level up, making this the perfect opportunity for sponsors keen to harness a community ethos, not just in Northern Ireland but with border counties in Ulster”.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Britain and France have backed his call for action.Maj Gen Konashenkov\u0027s allegations against Britain came after Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, claimed to have evidence that the attack had been \u0026quotstaged\u0026quot by foreign powers. Earlier on Friday it emerged that Russia could ban Scotch whisky in retaliation for sanctions imposed in the wake of the Salisbury chemical attack and any Western military action in Syria. Scotland\u0026#39s whisky industry could be targeted by Russian sanctions  A sweeping ban on Western alcohol imports is among a number of options Russian MPs have drawn up to hit back at the West after the United States imposed sanctions on Russian businesses following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Vyacheslav Volodin, a former top aide to Mr Putin who is now speaker of parliament,  introduced the legislation as a response to the “boorish behaviour of the United States” on Friday. The bill allows the government to adopt wide ranging retaliatory sanctions against the United States and its allies, but it also pushes back against Western threats of Syria strikes over the chemical attack in Douma, a senior MP has said. Western countries took action against Russia following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia SkripalThe bill in its current form explicitly targets the United States, but it says the measures can be extended to countries that adopted or simply “supported” sanctions against Russia.It could also target the United Kingdom, France and other countries that have a “certain position” on Syria, Alexei Chepa, deputy head of parliament\u0027s foreign affairs committee, told state news agency. The move comes as the US, Britain and France prepare to launch missile strikes in Syria“The legislation has not been discussed yet, maybe when it is there will be suggestions to expand these sanctions and actions to other countries, and other countries could be added to the list, including the United Kingdom,” Kirill Prokopov, an aide to Mr Chepa, told The Telegraph.“And if there is a military operation in Syria, that will be part of the discussion,” he said. He said parliament would probably not vote on the legislation until May.Britain and France are considering joining potential US strikes against Bashar al Assad\u0027s regime. The European Union has adopted several rounds of sanctions against Russia.Mr Volodin\u0027s involvement means the bill will almost certainly pass when it is put to the vote. Russian State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin introduced the bill on Friday It was not immediately clear how exactly the sanctions would affect the UK - but key provisions in the text would allow Mr Putin to target key British industries ranging from whisky export to legal and consulting services. The text published on the website of the State Duma, Russia\u0027s lower house of parliament, would grant the Russian government powers to take a number of actions including banning imports of alcohol or tobacco products \u0026quotfrom the United States andor other countries.\u0026quot Other measures would include a black list of citizens of \u0026quotunfriendly\u0026quot countries banned from visiting Russia, suspending special visa programs for highly qualified iniduals, and imposing embargoes on agricultural produce and Western-produced medicines.It also prescribes suspension of trade and cooperation in nuclear power, rocket engines, and aircraft manufacturing, hi-tech sectors where Russian and US industry is heavily intertwined. Russian-made rocket engines have powered many US space launches in recent years. In particular, the first stage of the Atlas V rocket made by Boeing and Lockheed has been driven by a Russian engine.It would also allow the Russian government to ban Western firms from taking part in state tenders for equipment procurement or consulting, legal, or auditing services. It would also increase overflight fees for Western airlines using Russian airspace.  In one of its most surprising moves, the legislation would “end the exclusive right to trademarks” and brand names on goods to be designated by parliament, which would open the door to Russian companies making brand-name products without rights-holders\u0027 permission.“The domination of the Anglo-Saxon, Western world is facilitated by intellectual property rights, and we will deliver a blow to this right,” MP Mikhail Yemelyanov told Interfax news agency.The proposed legislation grants the Russian government the authority to take such action, but does not mean that sanctions will be introduced. The United States imposed sweeping sanctions on several Russian businessmen and their companies last week, as part of a retaliation for the nerve agent attack against former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. The sanctions, which hit prominent businessmen including the metals billionaire Oleg Deripaska, wiped billions of dollars off Russian-linked stocks and prompted the ruble to e.  Russia banned imports of Western fruit, vegetables, fresh meat, and dairy products in 2014 in retaliation for sanctions imposed following the annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. Boxer Tyson Fury terminates TV interview when questioned about his two-year suspension India using immigration \u0026#39as a stick to beat us with\u0026#39 in Brexit trade talksMillionaire lawyer faces off in court with her elderly father after discovering he was sleeping with her Filipino nannyDouble beds and urinals at 35,000 feet – introducing the aircraft interiors of the futureAintree course feared to be wettest since 2001 when only four horses finished as animal welfare charities complainDonald Trump\u0026#39s threats clear Syrian regime warplanes from the skiesDonald Trump hits back at  \u0026#39weak slime ball\u0026#39 James Comey over lurid claims in new bookDuke of Edinburgh waves as he leaves hospital 11 days after hip operationHuge wave of poppies takes over Fort Nelson in Hampshire Probation service failed to protect woman who complained her convicted murderer ex-partner was trying to kill herFriday the 13th: How cyclones, a Buckingham Palace bombing and asteroids have fed the superstitionUS embassy in Cambodia fires 32 staff for allegedly sharing pornography in chat groupPrince Harry and Meghan Markle choose Alexi Lubomirski as wedding photographerPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsBeleaguered head of Open University resigns with \u0026#39immediate effect\u0026#39Comment: James Comey\u0026#39s cheap shots against Donald Trump prove he was unfit to lead the FBIPope gives holy boost to race car ahead of Rome\u0026#39s first ever E-PrixTube strike over sacking of driver who \u0026#39drove through three red lights\u0026#39 A quarter of Rohingya refugee children are malnourishedWhy Friday the 13th creates peculiar bargains – and how to take advantageWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"sir tim laurence shaking english heritage hardest part marrying","story":"Princess Anne and Sir Tim Lawrence marrying at Crathie Parish Church in 1992Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, husband of Princess Anne and son-in-law of the Queen, has driven alone in his Land Rover Discovery from Gatcombe Park, his Gloucestershire home, to the Shropshire town of Ironbridge.

In the last year, bitcoin has risen by over 500 per cent in value.At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at around $7,700 on the Coinbase exchange.In recent weeks, bitcoin has slowly fallen in value amid fears that the highs seen in late 2017 were the result of a bubble. At its peak last December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000.Other leading cryptocurrencies have mirrored bitcoin\u0027s return to form, with ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS all experiencing gains of more than 10 per cent over the last 24 hours.Bitcoin Cash feud deepens as famous @Bitcoin Twitter account mysteriouWill bitcoin recover from its worst ever start to a year?Cryptocurrency analysts recently suggested that bitcoin\u0027s recent demise was only temporary, predicting a turn in fortunes for the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency.Speaking to The Independent earlier this month, one expert said the price of bitcoin could return to its 2017 highs and even push beyond.“The price has been driven by speculators and they suddenly got cold feet but there’s considerable effort going on behind the scenes, including new underlying technology that is powering faster transactions,” said Michael Jackson, the former COO of Skype who now works in the cryptocurrency space.“Meanwhile, regulators seem open-minded and are now working to eliminate the risks for consumers. So I see no reason why bitcoin shouldn\u0027t’t fulfil its dream. And if it does then recent price falls will appear trivial.This forecast comes in contrast to comments from economists at Barclay\u0027s bank this week, which labelled bitcoin\u0027s 2017 price rise an infection that spread like a disease.Such analysis would suggest that the falling price meant the disease had been treated and gains of that scale would not be seen again.“We developed a theoretical model of an asset price with a pool of speculative investors and compared it with actual bitcoin price behaviour to see what it might imply for the future dynamics, the economists said.The model has clear parallels with compartmental models of the spread of an infectious disease in epidemiology.The most recent price rise suggests the infection has not been fully treated, with some analysts predicting even greater gains in the future. The most optimistic forecasts put bitcoin\u0027s future price at $1 million within the next three years.Follow our bitcoin live blog for the latest updates.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

A survey found 31 per cent of people are paying out £4,300 a year on average, increasing pressure on their own retirement plans and income.They are providing financial support to three people on average with their or their partner’s children the most likely (56 per cent) to be receiving money. Number of people retiring after age 70 doubles since 2010 Among those paying for younger generations, a quarter said they were giving money to grandchildren, 8 per cent to their parents and 2 per cent to their grandparents.Nearly one in five expecting to retire this year estimate they provide more than £500 a month to family members.   The money is most commonly used to cover everyday living costs such as food and travel, according to 27 per cent of those who give money monthly. However, 23 per cent say they are providing financial support to help with university education fees and living costs while 22 per cent say some of the cash goes to help with getting on the property ladder.Women are slightly more generous than men, expecting to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, compared to men who will hand over £25 less every month. Stan Russell, retirement income expert at Prudential, said that rising financial pressures such as the cost of university education and buying a home meant that providing financial support to family members continues well into retirement.  “While it’s understandable so many people want to financially support family members, it is important to make sure they have enough money set aside themselves to cover their own living costs and don’t put their retirement at risk,” he said.  The study found that a quarter of people retiring this year have families but don’t provide them with any financial support, while 43 per cent do not have any dependents.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A survey found 31 per cent of people are paying out £4,300 a year on average, increasing pressure on their own retirement plans and income.They are providing financial support to three people on average with their or their partner’s children the most likely (56 per cent) to be receiving money. Number of people retiring after age 70 doubles since 2010 Among those paying for younger generations, a quarter said they were giving money to grandchildren, 8 per cent to their parents and 2 per cent to their grandparents.Nearly one in five expecting to retire this year estimate they provide more than £500 a month to family members.   The money is most commonly used to cover everyday living costs such as food and travel, according to 27 per cent of those who give money monthly. However, 23 per cent say they are providing financial support to help with university education fees and living costs while 22 per cent say some of the cash goes to help with getting on the property ladder.Women are slightly more generous than men, expecting to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, compared to men who will hand over £25 less every month. Stan Russell, retirement income expert at Prudential, said that rising financial pressures such as the cost of university education and buying a home meant that providing financial support to family members continues well into retirement.  “While it’s understandable so many people want to financially support family members, it is important to make sure they have enough money set aside themselves to cover their own living costs and don’t put their retirement at risk,” he said.  The study found that a quarter of people retiring this year have families but don’t provide them with any financial support, while 43 per cent do not have any dependents.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I\u0027d believed one thing all\u0026nbspmy life and all of a sudden it was a lie\u0027A woman from Carlisle has been told she is not British despite being born in the UK and living in the country all her life.Irene Kaali, 24, who was born in Bradford and now works in local government, had her application for British citizenship “failed” because her parents did not have indefinite leave to remain at the time of her birth. Her parents moved to the UK from Tanzania shortly before she was born. They now both have settled status, with her mother working as a nurse and her father as a lecturer.Number of Britons getting EU citizenship doublesBritish-born man receives Home Office letter ordering him to leave UKBritish citizenship for children 22 times more expensive than GermanyBut despite this and the fact that Ms Kaari has grown up, studied and worked in Britain, the Home Office informed her she had “no automatic claim” to British citizenship, and that if she wanted to apply, she would have to pay £1,163, plus an admin fee of £80. A response to her request for a passport stated the application had been “failed” because in order to have a claim to British citizenship “one of her parents would need to have been settled or British at the time of her birth”.It went on to state that although she has no “automatic claim” to British citizenship, “from the information provided it appears she may have a right to register as a British citizen under section 1(4) of the BNA 1981.Ms Kaali told The Independent: “This was very confusing. I was born here, so I just assumed that I was British. I felt disheartened and confused about who I was. I\u0027d believed one thing for my whole life and all of a sudden it was a lie.Out of frustration, Ms Kaali posted a status on Facebook about what had happened. She received a flurry of responses from people saying they were shocked and surprised. “They didn’t know this was a thing that happened, they always knew me as being British,” she said.Friends persuaded her to create a petition to raise funds for her citizenship application, and within the first 20 hours she had raised half the money needed. She has now reached the target.British-born man receives Home Office letter ordering him to leave UK“It’s incredible and I’m so thankful, but for me it doesn’t really end there. There is an issue in terms of what they class someone as British is – it’s very vague. It’s a case of your parents’ status, and there are a lot of boxes you need to tick to apply, she said.“It says you have to have lived here up until you were 10 years old, you have to have not left the country for more than five years, and the last one is you have to be of ‘good character’. “It almost feels like that’s a sneakily vague thing they put in there so they can decide at their own discretion who they deem to be British or not.”Ms Kaali now hopes to launch a petition to change the rules around applying for British citizenship, and is in the process of speaking to lawyers and other experts to propose a viable alternative.She added: “I don’t feel like it’s enough to just stop here knowing that so many people are in a similar situation. Not only do you have to meet that criteria but you have to pay the ridiculous funds as well. Not every has access to those kind of funds.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIndian activists gather to show support for the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal, who is on a hunger strike against the alleged rapes in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, in New Delhi, India.

According to Riverside County Sheriffs, David Allen Turpin and Louise Anna Turpin held 13 malnourished children ranging in age from 2 to 29 captive in their Perris, California home. Deputies were alerted after a 17-year-old daughter escaped by jumping through a window shortly before dawn, carrying a de-activated mobile phone from which she was able to call 911 for help. Responding deputies described conditions in the home as foul-smelling with some kids chained to a bed and suffering injuries as a result. Adult children appeared at first to be minors because of their malnourished state. The Turpins were arrested on charges of torture and child endangerment.Mr Ryan, who was Mitt Romney’s Republican running mate in 2012, become Speaker in 2015 after Tea Party activists effectively forced out John Boehner. He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.
