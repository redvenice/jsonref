Regardless, the storm is expected to deal serious damage to both coastal and inland communities thanks to its strong winds and heavy rains.Even if it doesn’t intensify as much as forecast, the storm is still expected to be very dangerous, bringing hurricane-force winds greater than 74 miles per hour to the northeastern Gulf Coast by Wednesday, October 10 in the area currently under a hurricane warning.  This area currently s  from just north of Tampa Bay Area to the Alabama coastline, though tropical storm-force winds above 39 miles per hour are also expected to be felt in this area from the night of Tuesday, October 9 until the morning of Wednesday, October 10.Areas just outside the hurricane warning region currently under a tropical storm warning will likely see tropical storm-force winds on the night of Tuesday, October 9 and morning of Wednesday, October 10.    The powerful hurricane will bring torrential rains, strong winds and catastrophic storm surgeThe hurricane’s path is projected to bring widespread power outages to the Florida Panhandle region and even to southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, potentially leaving up to two million people without power from Florida to southeastern Virginia.In addition, life-threatening storm surges as high as eight to 12 feet are possible from the western end of the Florida Panhandle all the way to the Tampa Bay Area.For rainfall, the storm is expected to dump four to eight inches in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region of Florida into southern Georgia and southeastern Alabama. Local rainfall of up to a foot is possible while life-threatening flash flooding cannot be ruled out either.Eastern Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia could potentially see three to six inches of rain while parts of the Florida Peninsula, Mid-Atlantic and New England regions could possibly see one to three inches of rain.The storm could also bring some isolated tornadoes to the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia.How wide is Hurricane Michael?The storm is threatening more than 300 miles of the Golf Coast and is expected to make landfall along a 150-mile stretch of the Florida coast.Hurricane Michael evacuation zonesAs the dangerous storm bears down on the Florida Panhandle and broader northeastern Gulf Coast region, mandatory evacuations have already been issued.Three Florida counties have ordered mandatory evacuations, including Gulf County, where the storm could potentially make a direct landfall hit.Wakulla County has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents in its Zone A evacuation zone as well as for residents living in weak structures and mobile homes. Bay County has also issued a mandatory evacuation for Zones A, B and C.When will Hurricane Michael make landfall?Though the exact landfall area of the monstrous storm isn’t yet known, officials have expressed increased confidence that it will ultimately be in the Florida Panhandle.Florida Governor Rick Scott didn’t mince words when warning residents about the storm, saying: ‘Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades.’    The Florida Panhandle is in the crosshairs of Hurricane Michael as it barrels towards the coastAccording to FEMA official Jeff Byard, hurricane-force winds are expected to extend ‘well inland’ from where the storm makes landfall, noting that Florida’s power infrastructure could be hit even worse than North and South Carolina’s during Hurricane Florence.In preparation for the storm, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties and said that 2,000 National Guard members were mobilized to assist with the preparation and recovery efforts.Scott again issued a dire warning to his state’s residents as the hurricane took aim at the Florida Panhandle, saying: ‘Water will come miles inshore and could easily be over the roofs of houses.‘You cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out if an evacuation is ordered.‘Remember, we can rebuild your house, but we cannot rebuild your life.’ Who is Josh Radnor?

A drawing from the 19th century shows slaves aboard a slave shipUnder Tony Blair, the last Labour government introduced the academies programme, which gives schools freedom from local authority control. This was used to turn around sink schools in deprived areas and challenge the idea of the \u0027bog standard comprehensive\u0027.The Tories hugely expanded this programme and introduced free schools, which can be set up by parents. Mr Hinds will say the reforms have improved failing schools and by abandoning them, Labour is choosing \u0027Left-wing dogma\u0027 over standards. He will accuse the Opposition of \u0027attacking success and defending failure\u0027.\u0027Labour saw the evidence,\u0027 he will say in a speech at the British Library. \u0027They had a choice between what is working for children and what Left-wing dogma says. They have made their choice. For them, ideology comes before children\u0027s education.\u0027Under Labour, successful schools would be undermined by the whims of politicians, while schools that need help will be left to fail.\u0027          Mr Corbyn is set to call for the story of Mary Seacole to be taught in schoolsMr Corbyn is set to call for the story of Mary Seacole, the mixed-race nurse who became a heroine of the Crimean War, to be taught in schools – even though she is already on the curriculum.He also wants lessons on the role of British civil rights activist Paul Stephenson, who organised a bus boycott in Bristol in the 1960s, to be taught alongside the story of the better-known American campaigner Rosa Parks.Teaching should be improved \u0027to help ensure their legacy is more widely understood across the country\u0027, he believes.Marking October as Black History Month, Mr Corbyn will today argue for the subject to be taught all year round.The Labour leader will say: \u0027In the light of the Windrush scandal, Black History Month has taken on a renewed significance.\u0027                                                    On imposing council control on schools, he will say: \u0027Angela Rayner (the shadow education secretary) may call it \u0027local democratic control\u0027. I call it not trusting schools. Why do Labour want to put politicians in charge of schools? It\u0027s because they don\u0027t trust headteachers.\u0027In a letter to Miss Rayner, he will demand parents are \u0027given honest answers about what Labour is really planning\u0027.\u0027Since 2010, this government has given schools more freedom. Through the Free School and Academies programmes we …made sure that failing schools were not left to fail but were removed from local political control and given new leaderships with teachers in charge.\u0027I find it puzzling that you and Jeremy Corbyn want to distance yourselves from reforms that have trusted teachers, turned around failing schools and played a significant part in the closing of the attainment gap between rich and poor.\u0027Former international development secretary Priti Patel said a Labour Party \u0027whose politicians and activists act as apologists for the crimes of dictators and terrorists who have threatened our country should be let nowhere near our schools\u0027.She added: \u0027We have already seen that Corbyn and his cronies want to brainwash school children and end the freedom of the Press, now they want to talk down our country.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Weather Channel meteorologist dodges flying 2x4 live broadcast Hurricane Michael","story":"Jim Cantore was reporting from Panama City Beach, Florida, (left) when a plank of wood came flying at him (right)          He then ran behind a pillar to stay protected from anymore debris blown by the stormSanders thanked the meteorologist in two tweets after his live report, praising Cantore and stating that he avoided a concussion after being blown into a concrete pillar.In the footage, Cantore is seen delivering a piece-to-camera when suddenly the piece of wood comes flying at him. \u0027This was set up a long time ago\u0027: Defiant Trump defends...Share this articleThinking he\u0027s about to be hit, the meteorologist breaks off mid-sentence and jumps out of the way while clutching his head.In a separate clip, Kerry Sanders is seen swaying back and forth as the ferocious winds nearly blow him over.   The meteorologist also attracted attention for rescuing NBC\u0027s Kerry Sanders who was nearly blown off his feet          Cantore pushed Sanders to safety.

The ceremony will take place at 11am at St George’s Chapel in front of up to 800 guests.Most members of the Royal Family will be present, except the Duchess of Cornwall, who has declined citing a prior engagement in Scotland.There have been suggestions that Prince Philip, 97, who has a notoriously fractious relationship with the Duchess of York, will ‘see how he feels on the day’. But royal sources insisted last night that he will be there for his granddaughter’s big day. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/11/12/3E96045E00000578-6264709-image-a-4_1539257665138.jpg","title":"Oxford University Conservative Association BANS Bullingdon Club","story":"    Oxford University\u0027s official Tory group last night banned its members from joining the infamous Bullingdon Club (pictured, a photograph of the  film When Boris Met Dave, which satirised the time the Tories spent in the Bullingdon Club)Theresa May warns her radical plans to force 10,000 firms to...French business warns Emmanuel Macron that no-deal Brexit is...Share this articleOUCA\u0027s President, Ben Etty, told the Cherwell student newspaper: \u0027The banning of members of the Bullingdon club from holding office in the association – a club banned by the university and who\u0027s values and activities have no place in the modern Conservative Party – will I hope show that we are moving towards a more open, welcoming, and tolerant environment for all.\u0027The move comes a year after members of the Bullingdon Club were banned from taking their photograph at Christ Church College.Its members were embarrassingly escorted from the college last October after attempting to recreate a modern-day version of the famous 1987 picture that featured Mr Cameron and  Mr Johnson. Their humiliating ejection, which happened in June, was because the group had not obtained permission to take the photograph.In 2016 it emerged the Bullingdon Club, who expect their members to wear a specially made tailcoat that costs £3,500, was on the verge of folding and had only two members left.

Almadani (right) are also being sought for questioning in connection with the incident last week Turkish officials were last night considering whether to dig up the garden of the Saudi Arabian consul general in Istanbul to see if the remains of Jamal Khashoggi are buried there.Sources close to the investigation said they believe the journalist was dragged from Mohammed al-Otaiba’s office before being murdered by two men who then cut up his body.One told respected online publication, Middle East Eye: ‘We know when Jamal was killed, in which room he was killed and where the body was taken to be dismembered. If the forensic team are allowed in they know exactly where to go’.Khashoggi had arrived at the consulate in Istanbul shortly after 1pm on Oct 2nd to collect papers showing he was orced in Saudi Arabia and free to marry his fiance the next day.Half an hour before he turned up the local Turkish staff working at the embassy were told to take the rest of the day off because a high-level diplomatic meeting was planned for the afternoon.The source told MEE that Khashoggi was greeted by an official and led straight to Mr al-Otaiba’s room .Shortly afterwards two men arrived, dragging the 59-year-old off into another room where they killed him., it was claimedIt’s not known how the journalist was killed, but the body was then taken to a third room where it was dismembered.It’s understood the Turkish prosecutor general is now deliberating whether to dig up Mr al-Otaiba’s garden, to see whether Khashoggi’s remains were buried there.This is because one of the 22 vehicles registered to the consulate left the building at 3.15pm and went 200 metres to the address.The Turkish authorities are believed to have audio and video evidence of the killing but it’s not known how they got it.But, it seems unlikely Saudi Arabia would allow Turkish officials to dig up the garden at the consul.

He said the information came from a British intelligence source. Investigators are confident they may yet discover Khashoggi\u0027s fate despite their ban from the consulate, using data collected from his Apple Watch - which was connected to a phone he left outside with his fiancee.\u0027We have determined that it was on him when he walked into the consulate,\u0027 the security official said. Investigators are trying to determine what information the watch transmitted.\u0027Intelligence services, the prosecutor\u0027s office and a technology team are working on this. Turkey does not have the watch so we are trying to do it through connected devices,\u0027 he said.Tech experts say an Apple Watch can provide data such as location and heart rate.

Ten stayed at the five-star Mövenpick hotel, which boasts 249 luxury rooms and a ballroom.

Officials said it was part of a convoy of six cars, several with diplomatic number plates, which left the consulate grounds two hours after Khashoggi went inside.Turkish police were allowed into the building on Tuesday, a week after Khashoggi vanished, and said that CCTV footage from inside has gone missing and Turkish staff were abruptly told to take a holiday on the day in question.Yesterday, a source close to the Saudi royal family told DailyMail.com that the Washington Post writer, and long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, is alive and being held captive in his home country after being flown to Riyadh in a private jet.According to the source, after entering the embassy Khashoggi was taken in a black Mercedes S-500 and a white minivan with four Saudi officials to Istanbul airport, where he was flown on a private jet to Riyadh and is now being held.Flight records show that a Gulf Stream IV private jet, tail number HZ-SK2, landed in Istanbul at 3am on October 2, the day Khashoggi disappeared.

Khashoggi was driven from there to Riyadh, and was held there, the source said.The source was told Khashoggi is still alive, contradicting the claims he was murdered in the Istanbul embassy.Turkish police also revealed they are seeking information about a black Mercedes van on Monday in connection with Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.  WhatsApp records show Khashoggi last viewed his messages on his US cell phone at 1.06pm on Tuesday, around the time he entered the embassy. On Monday President Trump said that he was \u0027concerned\u0027 about reports on Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.\u0027I am concerned about that,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I don\u0027t like hearing about it and hopefully that will sort itself out.

Turkish TV channel TRT also revealed images of the private jet which allegedly ferried the men in and out of Turkey          Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) warned Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoonThe source claimed US officials found out Saudi agents planned to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia - although it was not clear whether they wanted to arrest and interrogate Khashoggi or to kill him from the information gathered.It is also not known whether the United States warned Khashoggi that he was a target, the source said.Saudi officials denied reports they sent a 15-man team to Istanbul on the day Khashoggi disappeared, saying that the only team they sent to Turkey consisted of investigators who arrived Saturday to help find the journalist.Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a stark warning to Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoon.\u0027Just met the Saudi ambassador to seek urgent answers over Jamal Khashoggi,\u0027 he said in a tweet,\u0027 Violence against journalists worldwide is going up \u0026amp is a grave threat to freedom of expression.\u0027\u0027If media reports prove correct, we will treat the incident seriously - friendships depend on shared values.\u0027He discussed the episode with the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office, Sir Simon McDonald, on Monday.Hunt also spoke with the Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir, for the first time raising the issue at ministerial level.          The former government adviser, pictured outside the BBC in London, has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since last year to avoid possible arrest.He interviewed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan before al-Qaida was formed, then met him in Sudan in 1995. Following bin Laden\u0027s rise likely helped cement Khashoggi\u0027s ties with powerful former Saudi spy chief, Turki Al-Faisal.Khashoggi rubbed shoulders with the Saudi royal family and supported efforts to nudge the kingdom\u0027s entrenched ultra-conservative clerics to accept reforms. He served as an editor for nine years on the Islamist-leaning al-Madina newspaper and was frequently quoted in the Western media as an expert on Islamic radicals and a reformist voice.However, he was fired from his post as an editor at Al-Watan, a liberal paper founded after the 911 terror attacks, just two months after he took the job in 2003. The country\u0027s ultra-conservative clerics had pushed back against his criticism of the powerful religious police and Ibn Taymiyah, a medieval cleric viewed as the spiritual forefather of Wahhabism, the conservative interpretation of Islam that is the founding tenant of the kingdom.Khoshaggi then served as media adviser to Al-Faisal, the former spy chief, who was at the time the ambassador to the United States.Khashoggi returned to Al-Watan in 2007, where he continued his criticism of the clerics as the late King Abdullah implemented cautious reforms to try to shake their hold. Three years later, he was forced to resign again after a series of articles criticizing Salafism, the ultra-conservative Sunni Islam movement from which Wahhabism stems.In 2010, Saudi billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal tapped him to lead his new TV station, touted as a rival to Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, a staunch critic of the kingdom. But the new Al-Arab station, based in Bahrain, was shut down hours after it launched, for hosting a Bahraini opposition figure.Khoshaggi\u0027s final break with the Saudi authorities followed the Arab Spring protests that swept through the region in 2011, shaking the power base of traditional leaders and giving rise to Islamists, only to be followed by unprecedented crackdowns on those calling for change. Siding with the opposition in Egypt and Syria, Khashoggi became a vocal critic of his own government\u0027s stance there and a defender of moderate Islamists, which Riyadh considered an existential threat.\u0027This was a critical period in Arab history. I had to take a position. The Arab world had waited for this moment of freedom for a thousand years,\u0027 Khashoggi told a Turkey-based Syrian opposition television station last month, just days before he disappeared.He also criticized his government\u0027s diplomatic break with Qatar and war on Yemen as well as Riyadh\u0027s policy toward its archenemy, Iran, whose influence has grown in neighboring Yemen and in Syria.In the Sept. 23 interview, he called Saudi Arabia\u0027s foreign policy \u0027narrow minded,\u0027 and ridiculed its crackdown on political Islam, urging the kingdom to realign its policy to partner with Turkey, a close Qatar ally.\u0027Saudi is the mother and father of political Islam. It is based on political Islam,\u0027 Khoshaggi said. \u0027The only recipe to get Iranians out of Syria - it is not Trump or anyone else- it is through the support of the Syrian revolution. ... Saudi Arabia must return to supporting the Syrian revolution and partnering with Turkey on this.\u0027Eight days later, on October 2, he disappeared while on a visit to the consulate in Istanbul for paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee. The consulate insists the writer left its premises alive, contradicting Turkish officials.Before his disappearance, Khoshaggi had been living since last year in the U.S. in self-imposed exile, after he fled the kingdom amid a crackdown on intellectuals and activists who criticized policies of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\u0027As of now, I would say Mohammed bin Salman is acting like Putin. He is imposing very selective justice,\u0027 Khashoggi wrote in the Post last year after he fled the kingdom, saying he feared returning home.He described \u0027dramatic\u0027 scenes of arrest of government critics accused of receiving Qatari funding. They included a friend of Khashoggi\u0027s who had just returned from a trip to the U.S. as part of an official Saudi delegation.\u0027That is how breathtakingly fast you can fall out of favor with Saudi Arabia,\u0027 he wrote.                                   Police CCTV video made available through Turkish Newspaper Sabah allegedly shows suspects wandering near the consulate on Tuesday          One of the black Mercedes vans at the center of the operation was shown on CCTV leaving the consulate on Tuesday afternoon          Tawakkol Karman, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate for 2011 holds a picture of missing Saudi writer Jamal KhashoggiEconomist and citizen-journalist Essam al-Zamel was put on trial this month for criticising the government\u0027s economic strategy in a series of tweets and reports.

The Belfast bakers refused to make a cake decorated with the words \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027\u0027It is deeply humiliating, and an affront to human dignity, to deny someone a service because of that person\u0027s race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief. But that is not what happened in this case.\u0027She went on: \u0027As to Mr Lee\u0027s claim based on sexual discrimination, the bakers did not refuse to fulfil his order because of his sexual orientation. They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation.\u0027LGBTQ children and teens are at a three-fold higher risk of...Gay and transgender students and teachers could be turned...Share this articleThe court also said Mr Lee had no claim against Ashers on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.Lady Hale added: \u0027The bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage.    Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur said outside court: \u0027I want to start by thanking God. He has been with us during the challenges of the last four years. Through the Bible and the support of Christians, He has comforted us and sustained us. He is our rock and all His ways are just.\u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful. Grateful to the judges and especially grateful to God.\u0027We\u0027re particularly pleased the Supreme Court emphatically accepted what we\u0027ve said all along – we did not turn down this order because of the person who made it, but because of the message itself.\u0027The judges have given a clear signal today. In fact it couldn\u0027t be any clearer. Family businesses like ours are free to focus on giving all their customers the best service they can – without being forced to promote other people\u0027s campaigns.\u0027I know a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today, because this ruling protects freedom of speech and freedom of conscience for everyone.\u0027On behalf of my family can I say thank you to everyone who has supported us or prayed for us through all this.\u0027I do want to take this opportunity to thank our whole legal team for working so hard for us over the last four years. And also to thank the entire Christian Institute staff for their help and support from the very beginning.\u0027We want to move on from this now, and I\u0027m sure Mr Lee does too. And let me just finish by saying that he will always be welcome at any of our shops. Thank you\u0027.Mr Lee was also present for the latest ruling in a case which has attracted enormous attention.The bakery\u0027s appeal against the finding of discrimination was heard at the Supreme Court sitting in Belfast in May.During the hearing the justices were told that the owners were being forced to act against their religious beliefs.David Scoffield QC, for Ashers, argued that the state was penalising the baking firm, with the courts effectively compelling or forcing them to make a cake bearing a message with which they disagree as a matter of religious conscience.Speaking outside court, Mr McArthur said: \u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. \u0027After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful.

Daniel McArthur said outside court that \u0027a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today\u0027Mounting an unsuccessful challenge at the Court of Appeal in Belfast in 2016, Ashers contended that it never had an issue with Mr Lee\u0027s sexuality, rather the message he was seeking to put on the cake.Now share your opinionMr Scoffield told the justices that the case, a simple transaction, raised an issue of principle since those with deeply-held religious or philosophical convictions could be compelled to act against their beliefs.Robin Allen QC, for Mr Lee, said: \u0027This was a relatively small incident in his life which has become enormously significant and continues to be so. That is a heavy burden to bear for one inidual.\u0027Speaking outside court, Mr Lee said: \u0027To me, this was never about a campaign or a statement. All I wanted was to order a cake in a shop that sold cakes to order.\u0027I paid my money, my money was taken and then a few days later it was refused. That made me feel like a second-class citizen.\u0027I\u0027m concerned not just for the implications for myself and other gay people, but for every single one of us.\u0027Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK or Ireland where same-sex marriage is outlawed, with Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s DUP allies staunch opponents of changing the law.Following the ruling,  DUP leader Arlene Foster said the judgment was \u0027historic and seminal\u0027, adding: \u0027This has been a long journey for everyone involved in the case. \u0027I commend Amy \u0026amp Daniel McArthur for their grace and perseverance. This now provides clarity for people of all faiths and none.\u0027          The UK Supreme Court has today released its judgment regarding the widely-reported \u0027gay cake\u0027 case.In 2014, a gay man and activist, Gareth Lee, made an order to Ashers Bakery in Belfast for a cake to have a message \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027 in icing, together with an image of Sesame Street\u0027s Bert and Ernie. The bakery refused to fulfil Mr Lee\u0027s order, explaining that they were a Christian business and could not print the message, and a full refund was given.Mr Lee brought proceedings against Ashers for direct discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and the Belfast County Court awarded £500 as damages. This decision was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.Ashers appealed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the bakery did not commit direct discrimination against Mr Lee. In an important clarification of the concept of \u0027direct discrimination\u0027, it must be shown that an inidual has been treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic, which in this case was Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. In this case, no evidence was shown that Mr Lee was treated less favourably because he was gay, and Ashers objected only to the message being requested. Had Mr Lee not been gay but requested the same message, Ashers would have again refused, so there was no less favourable treatment linked to Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. Rather than the inidual messenger, it was the message Ashers was found to have discriminated against, which was not unlawful. Lady Hale stated that \u0027the bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage, but that is quite different from obliging them to supply a cake iced with a message with which they profoundly disagreed.\u0027This judgment clarifies the narrow scope of direct discrimination.There must be evidence that an inidual\u0027s own protected characteristic was the reason for the less favourable treatment. Interestingly, had Mr Lee been a disabled person, and been refused a cake with a message supporting disability rights, it is arguably this would amount to \u0027discrimination arising from disability\u0027 and would be unlawful under the Equality Act, as it would be unfavourable treatment because of something arising in consequence of the inidual\u0027s disability. However, this broader concept of protection is only available to disabled persons. Other protected characteristics, like sexual orientation, gender, race and age can only rely on the narrower concept of direct discrimination, the limits of which have been starkly highlighted by the Supreme Court.Christian bakery wins appeal in Supreme Court \u0027gay cake\u0027 case"},{"url":null,"title":"Passengers help screaming man kicked plane resists deported Somalia","story":"    Result: The man was eventually removed from the Turkish Airlines flight at Heathrow Airport, after passengers demanded that he be taken off the plane In the footage a number of riled up passengers shout to \u0027take him off the plane\u0027 and a number others turn from their seats to start filming the confrontation.One passenger points out the man being deported says he is going to Mogadishu in Somalia and the officer responds: \u0027And you believe him?\u0027In another incident a passenger claims that people die in Mogadishu, the official responds: \u0027They die in London, sir.\u0027The Home Office worker then tells passengers he has been to Mogadishu several times and it was \u0027all right\u0027.

Musk raised eyebrows last month when he appeared on Joe Rogan\u0027s podcast and smoked weedThe SEC claimed Musk had not lined up backers and he\u0027d predicted the $420-per-share price based on a 20 per cent premium to the previous day\u0027s closing rate, because he thought this would be the typical uplift paid by a bidder taking a firm private. This calculation came out at $419.  The SEC alleges Musk upped it to $420 because the number is code in marijuana culture referring to the consumption of the drug, and he thought his girlfriend, Canadian singer Grimes, would find it funny.\u0027According to Musk, he calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20 per cent premium over that day\u0027s closing share price because he thought 20 per cent was a \u0027standard premium\u0027 in going-private transaction,\u0027 court documents submitted by the SEC said.\u0027This calculation resulted in a price of $419, and Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number\u0027s significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price.\u0027           Musk is said to be advocating for Antonio Gracias (above), the founder of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, to take over the helm of the companyHe will be able to continue as the CEO of Tesla, but cannot be chairman again for three years.

He claimed the bloc would at that point make a \u0027much more attractive offer\u0027 to keep Britain in.The comment came as Mr Blair\u0027s think-tank published analysis claiming that Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan for Brexit would cost the country billions of pounds.The Labour leadership has said it will oppose any deal that does not keep the UK tied closely to the EU.There are also claims that around 30 Tory MPs are ready to rebel in an effort to force another national vote on the issue. But the government intends to leave MPs with a stark choice between any agreement Mrs May reaches and crashing out.There has been speculation that dozens of moderate MPs could end up backing the government to avoid carnage.  Speaking at a Reuters Q\u0026ampA this morning, the former Labour leader was asked how he thought the MPs should handle a vote.He said: \u0027I would advise them to hold firm against Brexit. Either of these choices are unpalatable.\u0027Mr Blair repeated his call for a referendum that would include a choice to drop Brexit altogether.\u0027If we do get a blockage in Parliament that is when you get the opportunity to go back to the people,\u0027 he said.Mr Blair said if there was a second referendum he believed the EU would \u0027make a much more attractive offer\u0027. \u0027I think if she did that, in my view Europe would step forward and would be prepared to negotiate a much more attractive offer for Britain staying,\u0027 he said.May\u0027s moment of truth on Brexit: PM fights to push Irish...Barnier plays hardball on Brexit as he rips into May\u0027s...Share this articleMr Blair insisted politicians should \u0027hold firm\u0027 and not be afraid of putting the country on course for a chaotic no-deal          Mr Blair took questions on Brexit and other subjects at a Reuters event in London today          The former Labour leader hammered home his determination to force a Brexit rethink todayThe research published by Mr Blair\u0027s Institute for Global Change said crashing out and trading on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms would see GDP 4.91 per cent lower in 12 years\u0027 time than if Britain stayed in the customs union and single market.Even Mrs May\u0027s blueprint would see GDP take a 4.13 per cent hit, the study carried out by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) suggests.The service sector of the economy, rather than goods, will bear the main brunt of Brexit, it suggests.Britain is a \u0027hugely successful exporter of services\u0027, it says, and while exports to the EU fell after the Eurozone crisis, they rose in value from £70 billion to £110 billion between 2008 and 2017, an increase of 57 per cent.The report warns: \u0027Much of the overall rise in British exports over the last 20 years has been in services - the performance of manufactured exports has been easily the worst in the G7.\u0027On current trends, services exports are likely to exceed goods exports within five years.  Mr Blair said MPs should vote down any deal that Theresa May (pictured at an event to mark the anniversary of the government\u0027s race audit today) secures with the EU\u0027The EU is by far the biggest market for these services, something that cannot be explained solely by geographic proximity and the EU\u0027s market size.\u0027And leaving the EU\u0027s single market will hit the UK\u0027s services exports harder than its goods exports.\u0027The impact on services from the WTO scenario would be 2.1 per cent, double that of goods exports.The Chequers plan, which would keep Britain closer to the EU for goods but allow it more freedom over services, would leave it only marginally better with a 1.9 per cent fall in GDP, it claims.Mr Blair told the Financial Times that services were \u0027the forgotten part of the Brexit landscape\u0027, saying: \u0027Many people may think that though the short-term impact of Brexit will be severe, we will swiftly recover. This analysis demonstrates that this is not the case.\u0027The pain will go on for a long time and will only be reduced by radical measures of deregulation and cost saving to improve Britain\u0027s competitive advantage with Europe, which run in precisely the opposite direction of the policies now advocated by both main political parties.\u0027 A band of more than 30 Remain-supporting Tory MPs are said to be forming a movement to bring about a second referendum.Organisers say the group will vote down whatever Brexit deal Theresa May secures from the European Union.But the ultimate goal will be to hold another referendum on Brexit.The group is a rival for the Brexit-backing European Research Group led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.

They are both the stewards And, in a charming touch, Eugenie and Mr Brooksbank have involved her uncle Prince Edward’s children Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn.At 14 and ten, they are slightly too old to be a bridesmaid or page boy. But their role as ‘special attendants’ is a thoughtful way to involve them.‘It was a really sweet thing to do and I know the children and their parents are very touched,’ a source said.Mr Brooksbank, 32, has asked his younger brother Tom, 30, to be his best man. The ceremony will take place at 11am at St George’s Chapel in front of up to 800 guests.Most members of the Royal Family will be present, except the Duchess of Cornwall, who has declined citing a prior engagement in Scotland.There have been suggestions that Prince Philip, 97, who has a notoriously fractious relationship with the Duchess of York, will ‘see how he feels on the day’. But royal sources insisted last night that he will be there for his granddaughter’s big day. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/24/06/5098FE4100000578-0-image-m-77_1537765373345.jpg","title":"Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch puts 1m Hampstead flat rent 3 400 month","story":"    Benedict Cumberbatch has put his £1million Victorian townhouse in one of London\u0027s most exclusive areas up for rent, MailOnline can reveal          Cumberbatch\u0027s three-floor, three bedroom home in leafy Hampstead is being let for a hefty £3,358 per calendar month - £775 a week          The property, which features a roof terrace offering views over the city, was originally ided into two flats before the actor converted them two years ago\u0027He looked like he was about to fight for his life\u0027:...Are Benedict Cumberbatch and his wife expecting their third...Share this articleThe listing details on Prime Location.com describe the property as: \u0027A stunning 3 double bedroom triplex, with wood floors throughout and a fabulous South facing roof terrace.\u0027Set over the first, second and third floors of a Victorian house the flat has been refurbished to a very high standard, with beautiful features including original fireplaces, cast iron radiators, custom joinery, roll-top bath and bespoke kitchen.\u0027The property is situated in a popular family neighbourhood with a great mix of cafes, gastro-pubs, neighbourhood restaurants, independent shops and Marks \u0026amp Spencer.\u0027 Cumberbatch bought the top-floor flat in Hampstead for £475,000 in 2008 before parting with another £300,000 for the one-bedroom flat below two years later.He then converted both properties and extended into the loft space, costing another £70,000, with the work being completed in 2016.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, some corrections. Tom Mooney has come to a new understanding of William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying:When you’re wrong, you’re wrong. And I was completely wrong about William Faulkner. As I Lay Dying is a phenomenal book. I struggled like hell with Faulkner when I first tried him a few years ago but this time he sang to me and I heard every word. This tragic, rich, epic book is simply incredible.It’s been eight – nine years since I gave up on Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain – the only book other than The Power of Now (a rather bizarre choice of gift that I received) I’ve never finished. The fact The Magic Mountain is rated so highly by so many people only added to the sense of failure. I really couldn’t see how people had not only completed it, but enjoyed it.Then someone recommended John Woods’ translation to me and I cannot believe the contrast … it’s like reading a totally different book. The whole tone has changed – what was a dry and seemingly humourless book now has me sniggering away to myself. While still very wordy, it’s now a joy to read.Talking of wordy, sursumcorda has just “cracked open” A Small Boy and Others by Henry James:Well not exactly cracked open. I’ve put on my white gloves and reached for my lorgnette. This is a handsome volume from The Library of America, complete with silk bookmark, so serious face on here.James started writing this memoir at the behest of his sister-in-law, following the death of his beloved brother William. Wiilliam and Alice had travelled to England in some alarm at the state of Henry’s health but William died suddenly shortly after their return to Chocorua. (Don’t you love that place-name. I think Wallace Stevens loved it too.) Henry wrote to Alice in 1911: “The book I see \u0026amp feel will be difficult \u0026amp unprecedented \u0026amp perilous - but if I bring it off it will be exquisite and unique”.Henry’s health was still precarious - he died in 1916 - so this is a heartfelt labour of love.Sometimes, an immediate and “undemanding” read can be just as satisfying. Cookyhunter recommends Anthony Trollope’s Barchester Towers:I have been reading Trollope for months now (with forays into crime and children’s books every now and then). He’s just such a comfortable, undemanding, gentle read, and so funny, too! Right now I am deep in Barchester Towers. Everyone is convinced that Eleanor is keen on the hideous, unctuous Slope with his moist handshake and slithery cunning. Slope himself is battling Mrs Proudie over the control of the feeble bish. He’s also beguiled by the fascinating, amoral Madeleine and her sofa of sin. What a tonic!Ian Rankin’s Rebus novels have gripped BobHammond2:I’m going to an event with Ian Rankin in Manchester in a couple of weeks (my wife is a big fan) so have been working my way through the early Rebus novels in preparation. They are incredibly more-ish - I raced through the first three in a fortnight and am now gripped by the fourth, Strip Jack. Rebus seems like an irascible but endearing character with the obligatory troubled back story and home life.Meanwhile, Ellie Rose has found interesting parallels with Rebus in William McIlvanney’s Laidlaw trilogy:They are great reads, set in the seamy underbelly of 1970s Glasgow. Laidlaw is a policeman whose conscience won’t let him see the world in black and white, us and them, like some of his colleagues do, and you can see in him the template for some later obsessive cops (Rebus comes to mind). Unlike Rebus, though, his genuine affection for the drunks, down-and-outs and petty thieves of Glasgow is actually quite touching, and makes a change from the crime novel staple of the misanthropic detective.McIlvanney has a talent for a pithy sentence, too. Laidlaw hooked me on page nine with the sentence “His face was an argument you couldn’t win” and wouldn’t let me go until I finished the sequel, The Papers of Tony Veitch.The story of a DIY spy who plots to sell US secrets, if he can find any way to contact someone to sell them to. A man who creates secret messages using Renaissance-era cryptography, built up with tables of letters and keywords (the author’s explanation is most interesting), only to forget his own keywords from time to time.Sounds even tougher than online banking…Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us on : simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Here, a social buzz breaks the quiet: men sit on low stone benches, or baraza, which are carved into the sides of many houses, and fan themselves and chat at night, the courtyards come alive with men laughing in the balmy night air, drinking cups of masala tea and watching football on fuzzy televisions, as hawkers sell juicy skewers of spiced meat. And yet, amid all the liveliness, there is just one thing missing. Women.But today, instead of women gathering to socialise and share problems, the grassy gardens of the Old Fort are filled with vendors hawking tourist trinkets. Across the city, economic development , led by tourism, has usurped the spaces where women once gathered.Munira Said, the coordinator for Reclaim Women’s Space, cites a variety of factors behind the retreat of women from the public sphere: a growing population, globalisation and immigration. “The space for economic activities overtook the needs of the women.”Reclaim Women’s Space is working to change that. Employing female engineers and conservators, the project aims to study public spaces, take back those that have been overrun, and create entirely new ones. It is attempting to physically alter Stone Town to give the city’s women a place to gather, and to empower them to work together.Public space that caters to women enriches their experience by allowing them to encounter different perspectives, says Madina Haji, one of the engineers involved in Reclaim Women’s Space. “If you go outside, you see a lot of things. You can open your mind. You can learn something,” she says. “You can make a friend. And a friend can help you just by sharing the idea … Alone, you have only one mind.”One of the first places the project created was a community centre near the Old Fort. A small house became a meeting place where women could socialise, gain skills and to discuss what changes might help improve their access to public space.The project draws on recollections of those older generations, using a technique called memory mapping. Women recall and then draw memories of their favourite places in Stone Town, past and present. Then they imagine the spaces they want for the future. The process has allowed the organisation to create and preserve records of womens’ spaces, while also connecting women from different generations. “We thought the best approach for the women, especially women in Zanzibar who like to tell stories, would be by telling their stories,” says Said. “But not just telling stories: telling stories to empower them.”Reclaim Women’s Space also runs skill classes, from crafting to stonemasonry and how to run a small business. One exercise takes women around town to look at shops, asking participants what businesses catches their eye, what they might be interested in pursuing, and how they would innovate on the male-dominated squares, given the chance. Haji and her team of engineers are also working to physically create new spaces that welcome women, particularly those with families. “We can’t force, but we produce room,” Haji says. That “room” is something many of us take for granted: playgrounds.“It’s rare to see the men take the kids and go to those places,” says Haji. “It’s mostly women ... the kids play, and the women sit and they talk and they eat.”Parks where women can simultaneously take care of their children and socialise are crucial in Stone Town, Said says. She explains that even as women have gained more education, and started to work more, they remain in charge of household duties.“Women have to go work, while at the same time they are still responsible for their homes,” she says. “Whereas the men, they will go to work and after that they have time for social gatherings.” “We want to empower women to stand on their own,” says Haji. “Maybe we can have a president called Aisha one day.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad33ed45eb3c09aed845f1d9b11af670565f2a3/0_0_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1e90118a7b8ad64f736a9dbd54b8f81","title":"lost baby product conception grief pregnancy language","story":"The grief of losing a pregnancy can be compounded by language. More openness and sensitivity is needed“There’s your baby’s heartbeat,” said the sonographer, pointing to the screen as we listened to the thump-thump-thump that was the most magical sound I had ever heard. A week later, the next scan showed that this beautiful twinkling heartbeat had gone, and our baby had died. I couldn’t face having to wait to pass the pregnancy sac, so I opted for surgery: a procedure called an ERPC: “evacuation of retained products of conception”.I remember thinking that “evacuation” sounded like something you’d have done to your bowels. “Products of conception” might be the correct clinical term, but to us, as a grieving couple, that was our dead baby: our much longed-for baby, who was already loved and anticipated as a unique human being, not simply an object to be discarded.From the outset of your antenatal care, the NHS refers to “your baby”, acknowledging that the stage of gestation doesn’t determine the meaning of the pregnancy to the family. But as soon as the pregnancy is “non-viable”, there’s an immediate and stark switch in the language used. Bethan Raymond lost her daughter Bella at 16 weeks. “I was told over the phone that my – still very much alive – baby girl had a fatal chromosomal abnormality, and would therefore die,” she told me. “I’d barely had time to process this when I was asked how I wanted to dispose of the products of conception.”By law, babies born after 24 weeks must be buried or cremated: but for pregnancies lost before this stage, no such legal obligation exists. If you happen to miscarry at a hospital that doesn’t consistently implement a sensitive disposal policy, these “products of conception” may be incinerated along with clinical waste. By contrast, in Japan all losses have the same distinct status, regardless of gestation. Embryos, foetuses, stillbirths and neonatal losses all share the name mizuko, or “water child” – honoured and mourned through mizuko kuyō memorial services in Buddhist temples nationwide. We’re starting to learn from this here: bereaved families will light candles on Saturday, the culmination of Baby Loss Awareness Week, to commemorate the lives of babies who have died whether during pregnancy or after birth.Our language of pregnancy loss is so wedded to the notion of failure, unintentionally attributing blame: “failed pregnancy”, “incompetent cervix”. To a grieving mother, desperate for answers and quick to blame herself, even the term “miscarriage” suggests her own inability to carry, as though she has somehow neglected her baby. Joanne Smith was told at her 12-week scan that there was an empty sac and no sign of a heartbeat. This is known as a “blighted ovum” – literally meaning “rotten egg”. “What does a blighted ovum even mean?” she asks. “Isn’t blight something to do with diseased potatoes?”Language matters. A recent study found that four in 10 women experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after a miscarriage. Other studies show the depression and anxiety experienced by many women after a miscarriage can continue for years.“There is a fundamental discordance between the words that we use as clinicians to transmit information efficiently, and the emotional impact of that language on patients,” obstetrician Dr Larisa Corda observes. “Part of improving the care we deliver involves us improving our vocabulary.” There is never going to be a single vocabulary that’s universally “right”, as people may respond differently to different words – but just listening can go a long way. Just listen to us and the words we use. Take your cue from how we talk about our loss, and reflect our language.There is no reason that the language around pregnancy loss can’t continue to evolve – terms such as “spontaneous abortion” or “habitual aborters” are, thankfully, no longer used routinely in the UK. The Miscarriage Association has worked with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to improve its patient information leaflets, which now refer to “surgical management of a miscarriage” and “pregnancy remains” instead of “ERPC” and “products of conception”.I’m really hopeful that we will find more appropriate vocabulary, as well as providing better emotional support for couples after they suffer a miscarriage. But this can only happen if we all start talking about pregnancy loss more openly. One in four pregnancies end in miscarriage , but millions of parents suffer this grief in silence. Only if we collectively have more frank and honest conversations about this issue can we possibly hope to formulate a new language that respects and validates loss.• Katy Lindemann is author of a forthcoming book that shares real women’s stories about the emotional experience of infertility and pregnancy loss"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff73498bc3cb460d84f0d7f172b02143dc80790d/0_389_5976_3584/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=905d2e8fd1179ea08a1e2dd19bc71c93","title":"ofsted to ditch using exam results as mark of success amanda spielman","story":"Watchdog chief announces major shift, suggesting schools are too focused on test scoresSchool inspectors are to ditch using exam results as a criteria for success because of Ofsted’s concern that the current focus on test scores has reduced teachers to the status of “data managers”.In a round of broadcast interviews Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, repeated that the current “focus on data is coming at the expense of what is taught in schools”.Later at a schools summit in Newcastle, Spielman marked a major shift away from a results-based system championed by the former education secretary Michael Gove. She said: “For a long time, our inspections have looked hardest at outcomes, placing too much weight on test and exam results when we consider the overall effectiveness of schools.”She added: “The cumulative impact of performance tables and inspections, and the consequences that are hung on them, has increased the pressure on school leaders, teachers and indirectly on pupils to deliver perfect data above all else.“Focusing too narrowly on test and exam results can often leave little time or energy for hard thinking about the curriculum, and in fact can sometimes end up making a casualty of it.”The changes will be implemented from September 2019.Before the speech she told BBC Radio 4 Today’s programme: “We want to bring the inspection conversation back to the substance of what children learn and treat teachers as experts in their fields, not just as data managers.”On BBC Breakfast she was asked whether the current education secretary, Damian Hinds, backed the change in emphasis. She said: “He agrees entirely with our analysis of the problem, and we are working closely with the department to make sure that these new proposed arrangements are both consistent with policy and preserve our independence to assess education standards.”When it was pointed out that Gove had called for teachers to be sacked if exam results were inadequate, Spielman said: “What matters here is results that are achieved in the right way. What doesn’t work is where you end up with people chasing results for results’ sake, that’s the way that education can get stripped out. The rebalancing that we are proposing is getting back to looking at that substance to make sure that what is reflected in results really is the kind of education that we all want children to have.”Spielman said she wanted inspection reports to provide a different perspective from school league tables based on exam results.And she suggested that schools had become too focused on exam success. “The measures in primary schools for maths and English were never intended to make schools operate as if other things didn’t matter,” Spielman said.She added: “Unless inspection explicitly counterbalances, by default it is understandable that people will put more and more emphasis on those things that are measured and reported publicly. I want to help make sure that schools are viewed fairly, reported on fairly and have the opportunity to build on all areas of strength rather than focusing narrowly.”Teachers welcomed the proposed overhaul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2514409980bf053562d6dbef1a60674ba3564f49/0_91_4373_2625/master/4373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a1bf45b15dfd6a0e0df52aa8ef247f","title":"tea and buns with laurel and hardy the day i met my comedy heroes","story":"In 1947, the teenage Derek Malcolm saw the legendary duo perform in London – and was then invited backstage. As the biopic Stan \u0026amp Ollie premieres, the former  film critic still cherishes the memoryAs someone who met Orson Welles, Luis Buñuel, John Ford, Satyajit Ray, Howard Hawks, Katharine Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin and many others in the course of a long stint as the ’s film critic, I am often asked who was my favourite movie star. The answer is none of them. My favourites are Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Mind you, I was in my mid-teens when I met them, which probably led to the kind of adolescent hero worship I might later have abjured.My mother had taken me to the London Coliseum to see them perform. It was 1947 and they were in their 50s, with 20 years as a double act under their belts. It was the matinee of a variety show and they were top of the bill Elsie and Doris Waters, a pair of well-loved comedians – known as Gert and Daisy – and Rawicz and Landauer – famous piano duettists who played Chopin twice as fast as anybody else – were on the undercard.I can’t say that Laurel and Hardy were at their very best. Maybe the stage was not their natural habitat, although they were still treading the boards together well into the 1950s, as seen in the new biopic Stan \u0026amp Ollie, in which Steve Coogan and John C Reilly play the pair during their gruelling final tour of Britain. But I was thrilled to bits just to see them and I asked my mother at the interval whether I could meet them. She asked the theatre manager and he came back with a note. It said: “Yes, but don’t bring your mother …”The manager took me to the door of their dressing room and knocked, but left before Hardy answered the door. “Come in, young man,” he said. “We have tea and buns on the way for you. This is Stan, by the way, as you can see by his hat. He seldom takes its off, even in bed.”I was tongue-tied. But when the tray of tea and buns came in, I tucked in enthusiastically. Whereupon Hardy took a bun from the tray, placed it on his chair and sat on it. It was, of course, squashed flat. I’m pretty sure he did it to amuse me. But you never knew with Hardy, who preferred playing golf to working.Laurel looked horrified, especially when Hardy offered the flat bun to me. He was the master of most situations and the pair’s directors invariably deferred to him on set. He was also the British one, born in Ulverston, Lancashire, in 1890, and was once employed by the music-hall impresario Fred Karno as an understudy to Chaplin. Hardy was born in 1892 in Harlem, Georgia and drawn to the movies from his teens.It was clear that they were ageing. The cheers that welcomed them at the theatre, which was three-quarters full, were not so enthusiastic when they left the stage, which may be why they were prepared to entertain a young boy so anxious to see them. If so, they gave no sign of that to me.They were determined to entertain me and they did so royally, asking me about my school, the subjects I liked and whether I preferred the theatre or the cinema. When I told them I often went to the newsreel cinema on Victoria station, which invariably had a Laurel and Hardy short, along with the boring documentaries and songs, they were clearly very pleased. And they told me that many countries had different names for them. In Iran, they were called the Fat and the Skinny in Poland, Flip and Flap in Germany, Chubby and Dumb and, best of all, in India, Stout and Worrywart.We spent almost an hour together before they called for the manager, who took me back to my mother, who was waiting impatiently in the foyer. I will never forget that flat bun, or the stories they told me about appearing on television and being informed that they were being introduced to 6 million people: “That will take rather a long time,” said Laurel. Another of his gags I recall from that day was: “I was dreaming I was awake, but I woke up and found myself asleep.”But it was never verbal jokes that defined the pair. It was the extraordinary way they dovetailed, almost telepathically. No one did double-takes better than Hardy and few did weeping at fate’s enormity better than Laurel. They once did a short film in which they used 3,000 cream pies, most of which were upended over Hardy.But it wasn’t the pies that most intrigued me. In another short, the pair sat together in the front seats of an old car that Hardy couldn’t start. And, for a full three minutes they managed to make everyone laugh, just by the various expressions on their faces. It was a masterpiece of comedy I shall never forget, and so was the little dance they did together at the end of their Oscar-winning film The Music Box. Just meeting them was one of the most cherishable moments of my life.Stan \u0026amp Ollie is at the Embankment Garden Cinema and Curzon Mayfair, London, on 21 October, as part of the London film festival.

Come Christmas, my father and uncles would congregate there, holding up cloudy beer mugs to the light and nodding appreciatively.Increasingly, however, home brewers are knocking out kombucha instead – a traditional, non-alcoholic drink made with fermented tea.Take Jonny Wilkinson, one of England’s best-loved rugby stars. Rugby types may be better known as prolific beer drinkers, but Wilkinson has been brewing his own kombucha for four years. He says introducing fermented items into his diet has brought “a lightness, less conflict in my gut and a more alert, flowing nature to everything”. In May, he launched his own brand, No1 Kombucha, in Sainsbury’s with the intention of bringing the naturally fizzy soft drink to the masses.He is not the only one on such a mission. The fast-food chain Leon now stocks Suffolk-brewed kombucha from LA Brewery, while another British brand, Real Kombucha, will soon be rolled out in 320 Fuller’s pubs. In less than a year, Real Kombucha has reached “almost 50 Michelin-starred restaurants, almost 300 top hotels and 55 Laines pubs”, according to its founder, David Begg.The drink’s leap from health stores to the mainstream via hipster cafes has been swift. LA Kombucha’s founder, Louise Avery, was partly responsible for the drink’s graduation in the UK from murky cult endeavour to cafe culture. She began by brewing it at home under the brand Lois \u0026amp the Living Teas. “About five years ago, I started bringing up these cloudy milk bottles of kombucha to beautiful cafes around Islington and Hackney in London and they would strain it and serve it to customers.” It flew off the shelves, word spread and Yauatcha, a dim sum restaurant in Soho, came knocking.Many of these cafe owners had come to London from abroad – Germany, Australia, Canada – and were already familiar with kombucha. Avery says British proprietors were more sceptical, “because there’d be bits floating in it, like yeast people were a bit scared and disgusted. I had to explain it’s a live food and it will continue to grow.” In response, she took steps to make her product more palatable to mass-market consumers. “I figured out a way of mildly filtering it and adding a bit of carbonation to suspend the bacteria I make sure it’s chilled and I give it a short shelf life to keep as much bacteria as I can without it being an explosive product with bits floating in it.”It worked. When LA Kombucha launched in June, Avery sold 2,000 bottles. The next month, sales rose to 10,000 within six months, Leon had signed up and she had to build a second brewery.Promising scientific findings into how our gut affects everything from mental health to autoimmune disease have boosted demand for so-called gut-healthy fermented products such as kefir (a yoghurt drink), kimchi (Korean-style fermented cabbage) and kombucha, which probably originated in China. The brewing process for kombucha is relatively simple. Tea (either green, black or a mix of both), sugar and filtered water are sealed with a slimy-looking cellulose mat called a Scoby (this stands for “symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast”). Scobys, which you can buy on eBay, are produced naturally by bacteria and contain the necessary micro-organisms to kick off kombucha fermentation. You float this biofilm on your mixture and let it brew for between seven and 30 days, depending on atmospheric conditions and personal taste. The tea itself ferments, while the yeasts turn the sugar into alcohol, which the bacteria converts into acetic acid, making carbon dioxide bubbles in the process. The longer it brews, the less sweet and more vinegary it becomes.Kombucha’s twangy taste can be enhanced by adding fruits and spices, and most commercial offerings do this. LA Brewery’s ginger variety is satisfyingly fiery, like a traditional ginger beer with a dash of lemonade and the complex pungent, pickle taste you get with kombucha. No1’s passionfruit and goji is fruity and refreshing. Like LA Brewery and No1, Real Kombucha also comes in three choices, although none of these have added flavours – the differences come from the types of tea used. But all three producers carefully avoid making specific health claims, instead promoting the sensory experience of their drinks as something to be appreciated by connoisseurs.Why not push the health angle? Because, says, Paul Humphreys, professor of applied microbiology at the University of Huddersfield, “all the data is either anecdotal or from animal studies. There are a couple of rat studies around cholesterol and hypertension that show potential.” The only human clinical case studies published, he says, tend to be one-off events with negative effects such as people getting acidosis – when there’s too much acid in the body – possibly from drinking too much kombucha.Part of kombucha’s appeal is its live-bacteria element, but the jury is out on how beneficial the microbes in the drink are. Humphreys says there aren’t many “classic probiotic bacteria in it at all. Not the lactobacillus or bifidobacteria, which are the dairy probiotics. You get reports of people finding them in kombucha, but nowhere near what you’d find in some yoghurts or kefir.” That’s not to say that kombucha bacteria aren’t doing good – we just don’t know. And being a wild fermented drink, the yeast and bacteria profiles fluctuate.Humphreys brews his own kombucha at home as an alternative to soft drinks and alcohol. A number of brands have sent their products to his lab for analysis but, he says: “I would never make any health claims based on what we’ve found. I wouldn’t even infer them. It’s such a complicated product.” He prefers his kombucha sour and believes the commercial versions leave in more sugar than you would find in the traditional drink. “It’s lost in the mists of time, but these fermentations were originally about making water safe to drink, so they were probably quite acidic.”Being big on yeast, however, the drink does offer B vitamins, which could be beneficial if you’re deficient. It also contains some vitamin C. And there are polyphenols – plant micronutrients that are antioxidant-rich and feed the good bacteria in your gut. These come from the tea itself, but could be more beneficial in kombucha than in a regular cuppa. Whether the microbiological benefits can be proven or not, there is the undeniable advantage that commercial kombuchas often contain less than one third (or less than half with No1) of the sugar of regular soft drinks, and no artificial sweeteners. And if they help heavy drinkers cut down on alcohol consumption, there’s another win. This is precisely what Begg is hoping, as Real Kombucha hits pubs and bars up and down the UK. “We approached it entirely as an alcohol replacement,” he says. “We are in the space of champagne, wine, craft beer.”Rather than compare his products with soft drinks, Begg places them “somewhere between a fruity prosecco or a lighter dry cider”. Sommeliers have been enlisted to proffer food-pairing tips. The young leaves of “first flush” Darjeeling tea, used in his Royal Flush kombucha, produce notes of raspberry, rhubarb, blackcurrant and, he says, “a little bit of white peach, in the flavour profile”. It’s certainly interesting and strong enough to be sipped, occupying your senses as much any alcoholic beverage.Another in the range is called Smokehouse because the black tea from the hills of southern China tastes a little smoky, but the apple and caramel flavours it produces mean people associate it with cider. The only things missing, says Begg, “are the legs or potency of alcohol, but Royal Flush does even have a slightly puckering astringency in the background”.Begg’s first encounter with kombucha was a friend’s home brew, and it immediately satisfied the craving for alcohol he had been experiencing. He had largely given up booze, but didn’t want sweet soft drinks or water when he went out socially. Avery agrees: “Alcohol plays on a number of receptors and kombucha has that, too. Umami, sour, sweetness you have the fizziness and viscosity that sits on your tongue.” Whether pubgoers will order it instead of booze is yet to be seen, but, says Begg: “We’ve done it in restaurants – expanding well across the upper end as a wine replacement. Now, we’re saying the pub is the next bastion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dbd760838ddd8985a6c4d028318bd3bad3e1a6a/0_523_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9869bc324598cb2e8b6b3666cd598e5f","title":"matteo aloes recipe for pappa al pomodoro with mozzarella and nduja","story":"The Italian staple for using up waste bread gets a spicy twist with melted Calabrian ’ndjua and buffalo mozzarellaEvery region in Italy has a different method and recipe to salvage waste bread, from ribollita to polpette to panzanella.

The match is, according to goalkeeper Danijel Petkovic, the biggest in the nation’s history. After two games the teams are level on points at the top of Group C4, adding competitive edge to an already spicy encounter. Serbia are far from full strength: Crystal Palace’s Luka Milivojevic is one of several players to have dropped out of the squad since the World Cup after falling out with the manager, Mladen Krstajic, while the captain, Nemanja Matic, is injured. “Our ambitions remain the same,” said Krstajic, who revealed: “Matic will most likely come to Podgorica to see us because his boss is coming.” Given that José Mourinho cannot be monitoring Matic’s performance it has heightened speculation about a possible move for one of Serbia’s young stars, the Fiorentina defender Nikola Milenkovic and the Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. SBEngland will have revenge on their mind when they visit Croatia in the Nations League on Friday night. “We know what happened in the summer,” Harry Kane said. “It will be nice to try and get our own back.” Yet while Croatia lost 6-0 to Spain in their first game in Group A4, it will not be easy for England to flush their World Cup semi-final defeat to Zlatko Dalic’s side out of their system. For Gareth Southgate, the concern will be that his team will struggle to dominate possession again. When these sides met in Moscow, the game turned when Croatia took control of midfield in the second half and Dalic will have noted that England were outpassed in their defeat by Spain last month. It remains an issue for Southgate, who will hope Ross Barkley can bring his Chelsea form to the international stage. Barkley has not played for England for more than two years but the midfielder has started to show more tactical awareness and greater discipline since Maurizio Sarri’s arrival at Chelsea. JS• England players warned to watch what they say against CroatiaNetherlands v Germany is a fixture dripping in history – one of the biggest rivalries in world football. But with the Dutch having failed to win a game against their near-neighbours in 16 years, it has not felt that way for some time. A 2-1 win against Peru and a creditable 2-1 loss against France in Paris, however, have given Ronald Koeman’s side hope of breathing some life back into the flatlining fixture on Saturday. Koeman’s squad for the games against Germany and Belgium includes four possible debutants, among them the 21-year-old Arnaut Danjuma Groeneveld of Club Brugge, a supremely talented attacker who scored an astonishing goal from 25 yards against Atlético Madrid last week. On home soil, they are more than capable of exposing a Germany side that is still to prove the humiliating first-round World Cup exit was a blip rather than the start of an ongoing malaise. GBBetween 1994 – when Fifa launched their rankings – and 2015 the Czech Republic rarely dropped out of the world’s top 30. They peaked at No 2 in 1999 and reached the European Championship final in 1996 and semi-finals in 2004. Those triumphs seem very distant: they are currently 47th, last month they lost 2-1 at home to Ukraine and 5-1 in Russia, and they go into Saturday’s Federal derby at a low ebb. But their new manager, Jaroslav Silhavy, was the assistant during Karel Brückner’s successful spell in the noughties and is hoping to bring a bit of that magic back – with the help of his former boss. “He’s got nothing much to do now except gardening,” Silhavy said, “so he watches football. We talk a lot, about football and everything.” The pair were in the dugout on the only previous occasion the Czechs won in Slovakia, in 2006. Brückner is now 78 but may yet be tempted further from his garden – Silhavy is to discuss with his association “the possibility of greater cooperation”. SBThere will be no Cristiano Ronaldo, who was left out of Portugal’s squad after a rape allegation was made against him, though their manager, Fernando Santos, said he “believes completely” the player’s denial. In his place star-seekers will turn to the man who more than Ronaldo is taking Serie A by storm this season, Poland’s Krzysztof Piatek. The 23-year-old made his international debut against Ireland last month and his form since arriving at Genoa for €4.5m in the summer – he has scored 13 goals in eight games – is sensational. No longer, it seems, must Robert Lewandowski, who will win his 100th cap in this game and has scored in 10 of Poland’s 11 victories since Euro 2016, carry his country’s goalscoring burden on his own. SBHaving beaten Albania 2-0 in their Nations League opener the competition offers Scotland a realistic chance of an alternative route into Euro 2020. But in Haifa, where they face Israel on Thursday, they will come up against Moanes Dabour, a razor-sharp forward who has very recent history of dousing Scottish hopes. The striker scored twice for Red Bull Salzburg in the 3-1 defeat of Celtic a week ago and, with 15 goals in 19 games this season, he is in the best form of his career. The good news for Scotland is that Israel are not quite so intimidating as the unbeaten Austrians. They have won only one game in their last 10, against tiny Liechtenstein. They also lost their Nations League opener against Albania, whom Alex McLeish’s team brushed aside. GBSweden head to Kalingrad on Thursday ranked 31 places higher than their hosts but Russia, in 46th, look well-placed to make a mockery of the Fifa standings. Stanislav Cherchesov’s team have continued to ride the wave of optimism created by an impressive run to the World Cup quarter-finals. They won a tricky Nations League game away at Turkey 2–1 and followed this up with a crushing 5-1 friendly victory over the Czech Republic in Rostov. When their captain at the World Cup, the goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, retired this month, he said: “A very good generation has appeared in Russia.” They mostly play in Russia too, where the domestic game was given a huge lift by CSKA Moscow’s 1-0 defeat of Real Madrid in the Champions League. Sweden have lost both of their matches since making the last eight at the World Cup and they will likely lose their third if Russia continue their form. GBIn July Georgi Petkov became the second oldest player to appear in the Europa League and the following month the Slavia Sofia goalkeeper broke the record for the oldest player in the Bulgarian top flight. He was only half-joking when he suggested a return to international football, a stage he had not graced for nearly a decade, was still possible. By mid-September he had kept four consecutive clean sheets, and last week the call came. Plamen Iliev, who was outstanding in the 2-1 victory over Slovenia last month, remains Bulgaria’s first-choice keeper but Petkov could make an appearance against Cyprus, swept along by a wave of sentimental support. If so, at 42 years and 211 days he would become the fourth-oldest international in top-level European football (after the Greeks Giorgos Koudas and Vasilis Hatzipanagis and Billy Meredith of Wales). SBThe Republic of Ireland have unhappy memories of their last meeting with Denmark, who sealed their World Cup place with a thumping play-off victory in Dublin last year. Christian Eriksen scored a brilliant hat-trick as Denmark romped to a 5-1 win, leaving Martin O’Neill with an almighty mess on his hands. Unfortunately for O’Neill, cleaning it up has not been easy. His team’s self-belief has all but evaporated. They lost 4-1 to Wales in their Nations League opener last month and the mood has not been helped by reports of Roy Keane, O’Neill’s assistant, falling out with senior players, or by young talent Declan Rice sitting this one out while he decides whether to switch to England. Still, Harry Arter is back in the fold after his dispute with Keane and Eriksen is a doubt for Denmark. JS• Eriksen could have chronic abdominal problem, says HareideBorn in Azerbaijan to Armenian parents, Yura Movsisyan moved to the United States as a child, his family refugees. He set his sights on the US national team but eventually switched allegiance. “To play for Armenia, to see what it means to the people there, there’s no better feeling,” he said. Then came a controversial defeat to Albania in Euro 2016 qualifying. In the Serbian media talk of match-fixing swirled Ruben Hayrapetyan, the head of the Armenian FA, lashed out at his team. A group of players including Movsisyan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan released a statement describing rumours of match-fixing as “totally false” but Hayrapetyan said he would not select Movsisyan again. Last month Hayrapetyan was replaced by Artur Vanetsyan, and Movsisyan, who recently signed for Chicago Fire, is back in the squad for the matches against Gibraltar and Macedonia.

The photo-sharing app revolutionised smartphone photography by giving users a series of filters. You could flick through your options (moody Sierra, cosy Nashville, or nostalgic Valencia?) and in an instant everyone was able to look like a professional photographer.Don’t ‘over back’ it “The biggest mistake people make when uploading pictures is effectively ‘over backing’ the image,” explains Francesca, a 16-year-old with just over 1,000 followers. “This is when someone over-edits the photo and the result is tacky.”This is such a key lesson to learn that if Instagram had a constitution, “Don’t over-edit” would be the No 1 rule, and the punishment would be zero likes. “A lot of people put way too many filters on a picture,” says Vinnie Cohen, a 14-year-old with nearly 2,500 followers.“I used to want to go out with loads of cameras and stuff but it’s too much, the image looks forced, it looks too professional, it doesn’t look authentic.”Don’t mess up the captionA picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes words are worth a thousand pictures (which are worth a thousand words). So it’s important to make sure that you get the caption right.“Never say ‘cool’ or ‘lol’ – that’s so five years ago,” advises Molly Gibson, a 14-year-old who uses the app to post pictures of her friends. “And don’t like comments on other people’s posts – it makes you look like a stalker with loads of free time.”Francesca’s most popular post was a simple shot in her family home, but she believes it got so many likes because the caption was about saying goodbye to her friends after her GCSEs. “The best captions tell a story,” she says.Download editing appsThe Instagram filter is dead – long live the non-Instagram filter. Isla Brewer, a 15-year-old with roughly 2,000 followers, recommends VCSO and Afterlight as alternative editing apps.“The best filters on Afterlight for me are Woods, Flora and Cape,” she says. “On VSCO, my favourite filters are A6, HB1 and P5.” If that sounds a little complicated, don’t worry – Isla says pictures with no filter are “a huge thing right now”.If you forgo the filter, Isla recommends Snapseed to make small adjustments for brightness and contrast. “The Selective tool is also very useful if there are certain parts of the image you need to make adjustments to,” she says. “I always try to crop my pictures 4x5, because then it takes up more space on the feed.”Forgo a theme – and think in threesA few short years ago, anyone who was anyone had an Instagram “theme”. In short, this meant all their pictures matched a certain aesthetic – the same colours, borders, or angles were used in every shot. Nowadays, however, it’s all about the rule of threes.“The best tip I can give for curation is to remember your profile shows your photos in sets of threes,” Francesca says, “so it is important to make sure sets of three images look good together and don’t clash – it can ruin your profile.”The most important thing to remember – Molly says – is that you shouldn’t “spam” your followers by posting too much. “Otherwise people will get bored and you won’t get as many likes.”Location, location, locationIn case it needs stating, the backdrop for your photo is important. “The colours in your picture do have to semi-match,” warns Vinnie. “Obviously you’ve got to match your background with your outfit a little bit.” The teen advises against “random colours all over the place” and “loads of random people in the background”.Isla adds that angles are everything. “Before I take any pictures, the first thing I’ll do is take a look on Pinterest to give me ideas for poses and backgrounds.

We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82670f10d81666d206f2d5aea1e16c275ebc668e/0_450_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d06c4dd55839ea44c75288d5f6429faf","title":"introducing the new guardian weekly","story":"Today, I am delighted to reveal a new-look  Weekly, a beautiful magazine featuring our best reporting and writing from around the world.Before the  launched our first website in the mid-1990s, the only way for most readers outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland to read our journalism was in the  Weekly. Those readers included an imprisoned Nelson Mandela, who described the  Weekly as his “window on the wider world”.Launched by our esteemed editor CP Scott in 1919, the Weekly was the ’s response to the end of the first world war and the new world order being sculpted in the wake of the Treaty of Versailles.Its aim was to keep readers around the world informed by delivering them the ’s journalism and to showcase what was “best and most interesting in the , what is most distinctive and independent of time, in a compact form”.Nearly a century later, that purpose remains.The  Weekly is a curated collection of the world’s most important stories and the most interesting writing published in the , our Sunday newspaper the Observer, the and our international digital editions in Australia and the United States.Inside the new 64-page magazine you will find a round-up of the week’s most important news headlines, plus in-depth reporting and analysis of the biggest stories of the week.You will also find the best of our features writing, from long reads to interviews and essays.

But for women, the average age of retirement has jumped by 3.3 years since 1998 alone, to reach 63.9.The figures come amid mounting protests over the government’s decision to increase the female state pension age from 60 to 66, with some left destitute. Many say that a lack of sufficient information about the rise meant that many of the 3.8 million women affected did not find out about it until they reached 60, leaving them with no time to make alternative plans.At a protest outside Parliament on Wednesday, many carried photographs of women who could not be at the march because they could not afford the travel costs, or work on zero-hour contracts, or do jobs for employers who would not give them time off.Pension experts said that, for some, working into their 60s is a choice that is highly rewarding, but for others the outlook is bleak. Rachel Griffin, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, said: “While working into later life might be an option for some and actually might be their desired choice, for many with health problems this is frankly impossible or unwanted, creating a situation where you are forced to choose between poverty in retirement or working well into old age.”The DWP figures underscore the extraordinary changes in the labour market for the over-50s over the last two decades alone. In 1950, men on average worked until the age of 67.2, but this fell consistently throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Many dub this era a golden age of final salary pension schemes and early retirement. But from the late-90s onwards the pattern reversed, although men are still not back to the position they were in the 1950s.For women, the acceleration in working age has been much faster. In 1950, they left the labour force on average at age 63.9. This fell to below 60 in the mid 1980s, but is now back to where it was in 1950.The figures partly reflect the economic cycle, with unemployment levels much higher in the 1980s and early 1990s compared to today. But they also show the impact of women choosing to have children later in life, and returning to the workforce in their 40s and 50s.Women returning to work in their 50s have little time to build up a private pension pot. “One stark finding is the noticeable difference between men and women when it comes to their working lives,” said Griffin.“Men are more likely to work full time until their mid-60s when they will either retire or work part time. Women, on the other hand, are more likely to take a career break in their 30s, returning to work in their 50s.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee25567392ba4e4a0c87f19441739580162664f/1116_789_3456_2072/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6964d92b1ee2e537a49948c249ea841c","title":"jess glynne always in between review earworm everywomans ready meal pop","story":"The follow-up to Glynne’s ubiquitous debut is generic Top 40 and soul-pop finished to a high standardThere are artists who ascend to stardom in the traditional blaze of publicity and hype, and there are others who, to borrow the old Peter Cook joke, seem to rise without trace. Consider the case of Jess Glynne, who has spent four years becoming one of the country’s biggest stars. She has had seven No 1 singles, more than any other British female artist in history. Her second album, Always in Between, finds itself launched into a chart that her debut has yet to vacate after 163 weeks. Her music has attained the kind of ubiquity you might have thought impossible in a world atomised by personalised playlists and catch-up TV.Try as you might, you never seem to be that far from the sound of Rather Be, her 2014 collaboration with Clean Bandit, advertising M\u0026ampS ready meals, or indeed the sound of her imploring you to not be so hard on yourself blaring from a shop PA. Earlier this year, passengers threatened to boycott the budget airline Jet2 for playing her 2015 hit Hold My Hand incessantly as the background music on its planes: “I’ll walk to Portugal next time,” swore one aggrieved punter.The question of how Glynne has so gripped the mass imagination is intriguing. It’s certainly not as a result of her scintillating personality and unearthly charisma. A recent music mag Q\u0026ampA revealed so little of interest that the writer had to go with “I like baked beans” as a gripping opening quote. In fact, Glynne may represent the apotheosis of the bizarre 2000s compulsion for pop stars not to embody a world more glamorous, exciting, strange and suggestive than your own, but to be as ordinary as possible. Indeed, if the appeal of Ed Sheeran to teenage fans is that he seems like a mate’s older brother, just back from a gap year with tales of how sick Goa is, then Glynne’s appears to involve resembling the same mate’s older sister, who’s recently got a job as an estate agent and moved into a house-share in Hendon.Clearly her success is founded in her music, which brings us to Always in Between, an album understandably not minded to mess much with a proven formula. Something about the melody of I’ll Be There ineffably recalls the melody of Don’t Be So Hard On Yourself. And no one’s ever going to complain about the lack of songs with the ooh-wah ooh-ooh-oohing that propelled Hold My Hand to the top. You’re waist-deep in ay-yey-yey-yeahs and ooh-woo-woos throughout. For all the contemporary sonic gimmicks familiar from the Top 40 – from tropical house synths to vaguely gospel-ish massed backing vocals, to an acoustic guitar-driven track you can tell has been made in the image of the aforementioned Sheeran, not least because it’s been co-written by Sheeran – something quite old-fashioned lurks at its centre.At one extreme, it’s influenced by classic soul, heavy on the blaring brass – not so much Amy Winehouse as her less emotionally wrenching predecessor Joss Stone – and, at the other, undemanding dance-pop topped by an immediately recognisable voice, the same idea that garnered M-People vast success 20 years ago. Its best moments are what a Hendon estate agent would call “finished to a high standard”. The closing ballad Nevermind works up a genuinely powerful head of steam and the melody of 123 doesn’t need to be played incessantly at you on a plane to take up residence in your brain.At its least distinctive, it whizzes in one ear and out of the other at such speed that you wonder if it might not prove those conspiracy theories about the deleterious effect of streaming services on pop: that people are now deliberately writing the most unobtrusive songs possible so that listeners with a Spotify playlist burbling in the background aren’t startled into hitting fast forward. You register that it’s Glynne singing – to her credit, she’s worked out that you don’t need to go bananas with melisma to make your voice stand out – and that’s about it.The words either opt for the old disco trick of playing musical euphoria off against lyrical heartbreak, or trade on her everywoman persona. She’s moved to tell someone how she feels about them “because I’ve had a few”. Romantic despair leads to the donning of sweatpants and a night in with a tin of premixed gin and tonic. You can see why people relate to it, you can tell it’s going to be huge: it is what pop is in 2018, but the feeling that pop can be something rather more than this is hard to shake.Garden City Movement – Foreign AffairI only just discovered Garden City Movement’s debut album Apollonia – it came out in March – but it’s fantastic: a strange and wonderful stew of house, experimental electronics and blue-eyed soul, as demonstrated here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e9fa2a25d9e1e446c75bb2a62b5ef3508e4fc8/1090_810_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a10dbcb5653d43d7621022f234df5676","title":"could populism actually be good for democracy","story":"A wave of populist revolts has led many to lose faith in the wisdom of people power. But such eruptions are essential to the vitality of modern politics. By  James MillerEveryone seems to agree that democracy is under attack. What is surprising is how many of its usual friends have come to fear democracy itself – or perhaps to fear that a country’s people, too inflamed by narrow passions, risk turning politics into a distasteful blood sport, pitting The People vs Democracy, in the startling words of one recent book title.Observers have understandable qualms about political programmes that are alarmingly illiberal, yet obviously democratic, in that most citizens support them. In Poland and Hungary, democratically elected ruling parties attack Muslim migrants for undermining Christian identity. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte rules with an iron fist, pledging to put drug pushers in funeral parlours, not prisons.Modern democracies all rest on a claim of popular sovereignty – the proposition that all legitimate governments grow out of the power of a people, and in some way are subject to its will. Yet when a large majority of a country’s people vehemently supports policies a critic finds abhorrent, many liberals, even avowed democrats, recoil in horror.Thus arises the possibility of a painful paradox: that “democracies end when they are too democratic”. So concluded a 2016 piece by the US political observer Andrew Sullivan, resurrecting an argument made two generations earlier by Samuel Huntington (in a 1975 report called The Crisis of Democracy, issued in the wake of the international student revolts of the 1960s).Even the leftwing scholar Chantal Mouffe, who has long championed raw populist conflict as the essence of “radical democracy”, seems distraught at current events. “Democracy that is in good working order – with conflict, but where people accept the existence of their adversaries – is not easy to re-establish,” she recently told an interviewer, gesturing implicitly toward tolerance, one of the most jeopardised liberal norms in the current context: “I’m not that optimistic.”Current affairs may seem especially bleak, but fears about democracy are nothing new. At the zenith of direct democracy in ancient Athens, in the fifth century BC, one critic called it a “patent absurdity” – and so it seemed to most political experts from Aristotle to Edmund Burke, who considered democracy “the most shameless thing in the world”. As the American founding father John Adams warned, “there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide”.For almost 2,000 years, most western political theorists agreed with Aristotle, Burke and Adams: nobody could imagine seriously advocating democracy as an ideal form of government. It was only at the end of the 18th century that democracy reappeared as a modern political ideal, during the French Revolution.Ever since, popular insurrections and revolts in the name of democracy have become a recurrent feature of global politics. It needs to be stressed: these revolts are not an unfortunate blemish on the peaceful forward march toward a more just society they form the heart and soul of modern democracy as a living reality.It is a familiar story: out of the blue, it seems, a crowd pours into a city square or gathers at a barnstorming rally held by a spellbinding orator, to protest against hated institutions, to express rage at the betrayals of the ruling class, to seize control of public spaces. To label these frequently disquieting moments of collective freedom “populist”, in a pejorative sense, is to misunderstand a constitutive feature of the modern democratic project.Yet these episodes of collective self-assertion are invariably fleeting, and often provoke a political backlash in turn. The political disorder they create stands in tension with the need for a more stable, peaceful form of collective participation. That is one reason why many modern democrats have tried to create representative institutions that can – through liberal protections for the freedom of religion, and of the press, and the civil rights of minorities – both express, and tame, the will of a sovereign people.Thus the great French philosopher Condorcet in 1793 proposed creating a new, indirect form of self-rule, linking local assemblies to a national government. “By ingrafting representation upon democracy,” as Condorcet’s friend Tom Paine put it, the people could exercise their power both directly, in local assemblies, and indirectly, by provisionally entrusting some of their powers to elected representatives.Under the pressure of events, another ardent French democrat, Robespierre, went further and defended the need, amid a civil war, for a temporary dictatorship – precisely to preserve the possibility of building a more enduring form of representative democracy, once its enemies had been defeated and law and order could be restored.But there was a problem with these efforts to establish a modern democracy at scale. Especially in a large nation such as France or the US, representative institutions – and, even worse, dictatorial regimes claiming a popular mandate – inevitably risk frustrating anyone hoping to play a more direct role in political decision-making.This means that the democratic project, both ancient and modern, is inherently unstable. The modern promise of popular sovereignty, repeatedly frustrated, produces recurrent efforts at asserting the collective power of a people. If observers like the apparent result of such an effort, they may hail it as a renaissance of the democratic spirit if they do not, they are liable to dismiss these episodes of collective self-assertion as mob rule, or populism run amok.No matter. Even though the post-second world war consensus over the meaning and value of liberal democratic institutions seems more fragile than ever – polls show that trust in elected representatives has rarely been lower – democracy as furious dissent flourishes, in vivid and vehement outbursts of anger at remote elites and shadowy enemies.It is important to sharply distinguish democracy from liberalism – two value-laden words that, in recent years, have become almost hopelessly conflated and confused, especially in the work of social scientists and western political pundits who fret that western liberal democracy, once the “promised land”, has become “the enemy” in places like Hungary.Unlike democracy, “liberalism” is a relatively late addition to our political lexicon. In Europe, the word first came into wide usage in the 19th century by various political theorists and statesmen in France, Germany and Italy, united in their horror at the bloodshed of the French Revolution, but otherwise varied in their positive views.Modern democracy also has no necessary connection to liberalism. The Protestant champions of popular sovereignty in the 16th century summoned it for the express purpose of dethroning rulers with whose religious views they disagreed: “It was not religious liberty they sought, but the elimination of wrong religions,” as the historian Edmund Morgan wrote in 1988.What is clear today is that while democracy may be widely admired, it is, in its liberal form, an embattled ideology. As the social scientist William Galston has sharply observed: “Few leaders and movements in the west dare to challenge the idea of democracy itself. Not so for liberalism, which has come under mounting attack.” One result has been the rise of popular movements in which a majority of ordinary citizens has embraced a narrow conception of solidarity and rallied around a leader who claims to embody the will of such a closed community.Another result has been a resurgence of traditional anxieties, notably in the UK and the US, about democracy and its obvious dangers. After all, why should we entrust the fate of the Earth to large numbers of ordinary citizens foolish enough to support self-destructive policies and manifestly unfit leaders?Most ancient authorities reviled democracy in Athens. Plato, perhaps the most widely admired writer in antiquity, and someone who lived under democratic rule in the fourth century, criticised the false beliefs that prevailed in a city governed by public opinion rather than true knowledge, and he deplored the “insolence, anarchy, wastefulness, and shamelessness” that those false beliefs facilitated. The historian Thucydides, another citizen of democratic Athens, who chronicled the Peloponnesian War with Sparta that ended with the defeat of Athens in 404, essentially blamed the power of the ordinary people of Athens, and their susceptibility to manipulation by mendacious orators, for this catastrophic outcome.Thanks to such critiques – as well as subsequent political developments, from the Macedonian empire of Alexander the Great to modern European monarchies claiming a ine right to rule – for a long time nobody much cared about the Athenian political system, or about democracy as a form of government.The Athenian democracy certainly doesn’t measure up by modern liberal standards: at its zenith in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, it did not choose most of its government by holding elections nor did it protect the human rights of its citizens, as it lacked any notion of such rights nor were the fundamental powers of the Athenian polis enshrined in a comprehensive written document.What Athens did have is a community in which every citizen was expected to participate in the political life of the city – and far more actively than in any modern democracy. At the height of democracy in Athens, an assembly of citizens, open to all, met at least 40 times a year. All political offices were held by ordinary citizens, randomly selected, and all legal judgments in the city’s courts were reached by large juries of ordinary citizens, similarly selected. And all this happened in a comparatively large commercial city that dominated the eastern Mediterranean world for nearly two centuries.These institutions were the result of a popular uprising in 508BC, against Spartan troops who had seized the Acropolis. Instead of acquiescing in a foreign occupation, the ordinary citizens of Athens spontaneously converged on the Acropolis and surrounded the Spartan army. It took only three days to drive the Spartans from the city – which suggests the popular uprising had numbers and force on its side.The result was a sweeping transformation of Athenian institutions and the subsequent appearance, for the first time in history, of “democracy”, as a word to describe a regime where power (kratos) was in the hands of ordinary people (demos). Henceforth all legislation in Athens had to be validated in the assembly, which was now open to all citizens, no matter how poor. Even more important was the use of a lottery to staff most city offices and juries, which nullified the corrupting advantages conferred in elections by wealth and family prominence.By empowering an impoverished multitude in this manner, critics charged, the assembly and democratic orators had in fact created a new kind of tyranny – a collective tyranny of the majority, a de facto welfare state that doled out money and patronage to the ordinary citizens who manned the imperial fleet and staffed the city’s courts and offices.For Plato, the key problem was epistemological: most people – “the many” – had no knowledge of truth and no clear pattern of justice in their minds. Democracy corrupted even intelligent citizens by leading them to dumb down their policies in order to pander to ignorant crowds. When they gathered “in assemblies, courts, theatres, army camps, or any other common meeting of a multitude,” the Athenian demos, Plato reports, would “blame some of the things said or done, and praise others, both in excess, shouting and clapping and besides, the rocks and the very place surrounding them echo and redouble the uproar of praise and blame.”After the eclipse of direct self-rule in the ancient world, the idea of democracy survived, barely. In the west, it was mainly used as a term of art, deployed by legal scholars, generally in two contradictory usages. On the one hand, democracy became a virtual synonym for violent anarchy: the Roman historian Polybius said “the license and lawlessness” of democracy inevitably “produces mob rule”, to complete a cycle through which all governments had to pass, going from best (monarchy) to worst (democracy, and then mob rule).On the other hand, Polybius also argued that democracy had a potentially constructive role to play. He suggested that the most durable political regime would be a republic that combined the three pure forms of government (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) into interlinked branches that would check and balance each other, enabling a well-ordered republic to navigate the winds of time “like a well-trimmed boat”.In the centuries that followed, a tradition of republican thought emerged, based on the example of ancient Rome. During the Renaissance, some theorists working within the republican tradition cautiously suggested that ordinary people might have an especially useful role to play, especially as watchdogs and soldiers. Because they were jealous of their freedom, they would be vigilant spectators of executive and administrative conduct, on guard against malfeasance. The very passions of the people, which could generate a certain esprit de corps, could also be harnessed for the enhancement of a republic’s military might. Machiavelli, dreaming of a resurgence of Italian glory in the Renaissance, was eager to exploit popular ardour: “The best armies are those of armed peoples,” rather than paid mercenaries.At the same time, republican writers tended to agree that the chief danger to a mixed constitution came from the democratic element, because of its tendency to degenerate into violence and anarchy. Machiavelli warned that the people, left to their own devices, were “promoters of license”. Algernon Sidney, an English republican beheaded for expressing treasonous views in 1683, denied being a proponent of pure democracy. So did the Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu, who pointedly worried about the “spirit of extreme equality” he assumed was typical of democracies. Even in the US, in the wake of a war against colonial rule by a distant monarch and amid expansive new assertions of the power of the people, political theorists handled the idea of democracy gingerly, if they acknowledged it at all.In this context, the political writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau came as a shock. The key was the audacious way he redefined sovereignty in terms of democracy. Before Rousseau, “sovereignty” had implied brute force, empire and the ability to command. After him, it defined not the dominion of monarchs, but the legitimate power of a people. In the wake of the French Revolution, he came to be seen as a prophet, for writings such as this, from Emile, first published in 1763: “The great become small, the rich become poor, the monarch becomes subject are the blows of fate so rare that you can count on being exempted from them? We are approaching the state of crisis and the century of revolutions.”By the summer of 1792, militants inspired by Rousseau were arguing that political power, properly understood, belonged neither to a king, nor to a distant body of elected representatives, but rather to the people assembled in their local neighbourhoods, where they could discuss their shared fate face to face. Events came to a head on 10 August 1792, when a majority of these local assemblies resolved that only an armed revolt would assure that the French people were truly sovereign. At midnight, they seized the town hall in the morning they assaulted the king’s quarters at the Tuileries Palace, although by then he and his family had fled for their lives.The most radically democratic phase of the French Revolution thus began with a carnival of atrocities. But the violence cracked open a new world of political possibilities. For the first time since ancient Athens, direct democracy had become a concrete, collective goal – at least in the minds of the Parisian commoners streaming through the streets with their muskets and pikes.This uprising led to the dissolution of the French National Assembly, the convening of a constitutional convention and the public execution of the king after a show trial. The convention enabled Condorcet to draft the world’s first democratic constitution. But it was never implemented – a Jacobin coup forced Condorcet into hiding, and led to a reign of terror, which the Jacobin leader, Robespierre, argued was necessary to defend the nascent democracy from its many foes, both foreign and French.In the autumn of 1793, the new republic’s conscripts, on orders from Paris, embarked on a murderous rampage in the Vendée that killed some 250,000 people, most of them innocent men, women and children. The French Revolution had resurrected the idea of democracy – and produced a hecatomb on a grand scale.“Of this I am certain,” Burke declared, “that in a democracy, the majority of the citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon the minority.” In the aftermath of the French Revolution, his fears were widely shared by conservatives and self-described “liberals”.Fearful of armed crowds and the possibility of mob rule, the American constitution had been explicitly designed to empower not ordinary citizens, but a “natural aristocracy”. As Benjamin Rush, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, explained: “All power is derived from the people” – but this power is not wielded by the people: “They possess it only on the days of their elections. After this, it is property of their rulers, nor can they exercise or resume it, unless it is abused.”To this day, the US remains a deeply flawed democracy. It still has an electoral college designed to thwart majorities. It still has a senate that guarantees inequality of political representation. It still is the scene of pitched struggles over the right to vote.Yet, this primordial American prejudice against democracy was almost instantly transformed by an equally passionate upwelling of American enthusiasm for democracy, in the wake of the French Revolution. Among the enthusiasts was Thomas Jefferson, who, in 1800, brought his Democratic-Republican party to power, and in this way also brought democracy – at least as a word – into the American lexicon.A generation later, Andrew Jackson, the first great American democratic leader – or, demagogue, to use the ancient Greek term of art for such a leader – became the US’s first plebiscitary president, imbued with imperial prerogatives in the eyes of his most ardent supporters. He was, after all, the only representative nominally elected by all the nation’s people (unless, of course, they were women, slaves or Native Americans – democracy in America in Jackson’s day was only the white man’s business).Jackson tried, and failed, to eliminate the electoral college. Such enduring limits to democracy in the US were, paradoxically, one reason why it was the first country to give birth to populism, both as a word and as a phenomenon. From 1892 till 1896, a People’s Party played a major political role in some parts of the US.At roughly the same time, Woodrow Wilson, arguably the country’s most ardent champion of democracy, criticised the populist movement and offered, instead, a new vision of the democratic system. A pioneering political scientist who would become the 28th president, Wilson pondered deeply the meaning of democracy, not just in the US, but in world history, where it marked in his view the highest stage of human evolution. In his private papers, after rejecting European conceptions of democracy as primitive, and corrupted by class conflict, he defined modern democracy “most briefly” as “government by popular opinion”.As Wilson concedes almost in passing, democracy in practice will always involve “the many led by the few: the minds of the few disciplined by persuading, and masses of men schooled and directed by being persuaded”. In other words, Wilson’s vision of self-rule is closer to Adams’s “natural aristocracy” than the popular sovereignty the French revolutionaries and American populists fought for.We find here a core ambiguity at the heart of modern liberal democracy, as Wilson understood it. All power in theory derives from the people – but in practice, the truest vessel of a people’s hopes will be its highest elected official when he enjoys the support of “public opinion”.There were, nonetheless, serious problems with Wilson’s recourse to public opinion. Views could rapidly change, and even an orator as persuasive as Wilson could not be sure if he had persuaded his fellows once and for all. Even worse – as Walter Lippmann pointed out in his landmark 1922 study, Public Opinion – in a complex political environment, where only disconnected bits of information are available to the average citizen, it was almost impossible in practice for the public’s opinion on any matter of moment to be either cogent or coherent.Lippman used for his epigraph Plato’s famous image of the inhabitants of a cave bewitched by shadows and unaware of the real world outside. The majority of modern men, Lippmann argues, are prisoners of shadowy and unexamined assumptions, immersed in private lives involving the pursuit of personal interests, with limited time and even less attention to give to public affairs.Lippmann’s conclusion is most bluntly stated in The Phantom Public: “The inidual man does not have opinions on all public affairs. He does not know how to direct public affairs. He does not know what is happening, why it is happening, what ought to happen. I cannot imagine how he could know, and there is not the least reason for thinking, as mystical democrats have thought, that the compounding of inidual ignorances in masses of people can produce a continuous directing force in public affairs.”In 1942, Joseph Schumpeter, an economist who had been born in Moravia and raised in Vienna before moving to the US in 1932 to teach at Harvard University, accurately summed up the strange results of merging a liberal democratic faith in public opinion with marketing methods refined by behavioural scientists. “What we are confronted with in the analysis of political processes,” he wrote, “is largely not a genuine but a manufactured will.”In his day, the primary tools for the manipulation of opinion were advertising and propaganda tailored to the results of public opinion polling. In our day, the integrity of public opinion is further threatened by the secrecy of many aspects of executive decision-making, and the increasingly sophisticated control of information by behavioural scientists and attention merchants, who are able to use new technologies to aim messages with unprecedented precision at responsive audiences.Schumpeter argued that the primary role of the people in a liberal democracy was in any case strictly limited: it was “to produce a government, or else an intermediate body which in turn will produce a national executive or government … the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which iniduals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people’s vote.”In other words, modern democracy was not the rule of a sovereign people – instead, “democracy is the rule of the politician”, someone skilled at commanding public opinion and winning elections, whose power is chiefly balanced by his need for reelection, and the requirement that he leave office peacefully, should he lose the vote.Schumpeter was writing during the second world war, which had led to the total mobilisation of the civilian population in all combatant states. Worldwide, this unprecedented mobilisation led to the unprecedented slaughter of 60 million souls, the majority of them civilians, and six million of them Jews. In the US, it entailed a dramatic increase in the powers of the administrative state and of the state’s armed forces it also triggered a rise in the perceived need to keep key political deliberations and decisions concealed from the public.Faced with such facts, no wonder Schumpeter was pessimistic about future political prospects, fearing that a “socialist democracy may eventually turn out to be more of a sham than capitalist democracy ever was”.And yet, as the second world war unfolded, just as had happened during the first world war, there was a paradoxical resurgence of democratic idealism, inspired by renewed Allied claims that their victory would help forge a world “made safe for democracy”, just as Wilson had promised two generations earlier.After the horrors of two world wars, many hoped humanity would never again resort to violence on this industrial scale. After some hesitation, and with compromising caveats similar to those that undermined the League of Nations covenant – above all, a continuing effort to protect the imperial and racial prerogatives of the great powers – the victors agreed to create a new international organisation, the United Nations, and to ratify a new set of global principles, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948.It is easy to minimise the importance of a political document issued with no means of enforcing the norms it proclaimed. Yet the language of the declaration helped to inspire later human rights movements, and article 21 explicitly affirms that “everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives”.Here is a key irony of the modern world: to this day, democracy, in most existing regimes, whether liberal or socialist or nationalist, is more or less a sham, even according to the criteria laid out in the UDHR, and just as Schumpeter said.Still, this “sham” also represents an epochal transformation: in the early 21st century, very few regimes, unlike most in the early 18th century, can rule over a subject population with impunity. On the contrary: the rulers of every contemporary regime that professes democratic values, however feebly realised, must periodically face the mundane threat posed by ordinary citizens, however uninformed, periodically queuing at a polling station, to exercise their right to vote, and so to transfer power, if they choose, to an entirely new set of political leaders.This is, as the Cambridge historian John Dunn puts it in the dyspeptic but accurate conclusion to his 2005 history of democracy, “a world in which faith, deference and even loyalty have largely passed away, and the keenest of personal admiration seldom lasts for long” – a wan description of what the modern democratic spirit has wrought.Yet this is also a world where the ideal of democracy is more universally honoured than ever before, and sometimes taken quite seriously, for better or worse.For example, in the decades since the ratification of the UDHR in 1948, most US presidents and diplomats have followed in Wilson’s footsteps by promoting liberal democratic expectations around the world – sometimes at gunpoint – just as communist regimes were trying at the same time to export their rival version of “democratic centralism”.So it is perhaps not surprising that our world has also witnessed, in virtually every country, poor or developed, socialist or communist, autocratic or liberal, a fitful, sometimes futile series of popular uprisings and protests, when crowds of ordinary people unite to demand a fairer share of the common wealth – and to claim for themselves a larger share in more truly democratic institutions. These revolts against remote elites are essential to the vitality, and viability, of modern democracy – even as (and precisely because) they challenge the status quo, destructive though that challenge may be.There are good reasons to be wary of what a people trying to exercise its sovereign rights may produce. Democratic revolts can create perverse results – and so can democratic elections. Despite the obvious risks, both Rousseau and Jefferson invoked a relevant maxim in defence of their own faith in ordinary citizens: Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem – “I prefer a dangerous freedom to peaceful slavery.” It’s an apt motto for these dark times.Adapted from Can Democracy Work?

It was discovered by Stephen Hawking 43 years ago, and until recently has puzzled many.Starting in 2015, Stephen, Andrew Strominger and I started to wonder if we could understand a way out of this difficulty by questioning the basic assumptions that underlie the difficulties. We published our first paper on the subject in 2016 and have been working hard on this problem ever since.The most recent work, and perhaps the last paper that Stephen was involved in, has just come out. While we have not solved the information paradox, we hope that we have paved the way, and we are continuing our intensive work in this area.Physics is really about being able to predict the future given how things are now. For example, if you throw a ball, once you know its initial position and velocity, then you can figure out where it will be in the future. That kind of reasoning is fine for what we call classical physics but for small things, like atoms and electrons, the rules need some modifications, as described by quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, instead of describing precise outcomes, one finds that one can only calculate the probabilities for various things to happen. In the case of a ball being thrown, one would not know its precise trajectory, but only the probability that it would be in some particular place given its initial conditions.What Hawking discovered was that in black hole physics, there seemed to be even greater uncertainty than in quantum mechanics. However, this kind of uncertainty seemed to be completely unacceptable in that it resulted in many of the laws of physics appearing to break down. It would deprive us of the ability to predict anything about the future of a black hole.That might not have mattered – except that black holes are real physical objects. There are huge black holes at the centres of many galaxies. We know this because observations of the centre of our galaxy show that there is a compact object with a mass of a few million times that of our sun there such a huge concentration of mass could only be a black hole. Quasars, extremely luminous objects at the centres of very distant galaxies, are powered by matter falling onto black holes. The observatory Ligo has recently discovered ripples in spacetime, gravitational waves, produced by the collision of black holes.The root of the problem is that it was once thought that black holes were completely described by their mass and their spin. If you threw something into a black hole, once it was inside you would be unable to tell what it was that was thrown in.These ideas were encapsulated in the phrase “a black hole has no hair”. We can often tell people apart by looking their hair, but black holes seemed to be completely bald. Back in 1974, Stephen discovered that black holes, rather than being perfect absorbers, behave more like what we call “black bodies”. A black body is characterised by a temperature, and all bodies with a temperature produce thermal radiation.If you go to a doctor, it is quite likely your temperature will be measured by having a device pointed at you. This is an infrared sensor and it measures your temperature by detecting the thermal radiation you produce. A piece of metal heated up in a fire will glow because it produces thermal radiation.Black holes are no different. They have a temperature and produce thermal radiation. The formula for this temperature, universally known as the Hawking temperature, is inscribed on the memorial to Stephen’s life in Westminster Abbey. Any object that has a temperature also has an entropy. The entropy is a measure of how many different ways an object could be made from its microscopic ingredients and still look the same. So, for a particular piece of red hot metal, it would be the number of ways the atoms that make it up could be arranged so as to look like the lump of metal you were observing. Stephen’s formula for the temperature of a black hole allowed him to find the entropy of a black hole.The problem then was: how did this entropy arise? Since all black holes appear to be the same, the origin of the entropy was at the centre of the information paradox.What we have done recently is to discover a gap in the mathematics that led to the idea that black holes are totally bald. In 2016, Stephen, Andy and I found that black holes have an infinite collection of what we call “soft hair”. This discovery allows us to question the idea that black holes lead to a breakdown in the laws of physics.Stephen kept working with us up to the end of his life, and we have now published a paper that describes our current thoughts on the matter. In this paper, we describe a way of calculating the entropy of black holes. The entropy is basically a quantitative measure of what one knows about a black hole apart from its mass or spin.While this is not a resolution of the information paradox, we believe it provides some considerable insight into it. Further work is needed but we feel greatly encouraged to continue our research in this area. The information paradox is intimately tied up with our quest to find a theory of gravity that is compatible with quantum mechanics.Einstein’s general theory of relativity is extremely successful at describing spacetime and gravitation on large scales, but to see how the world works on small scales requires quantum theory. There are spectacularly successful theories of the non-gravitational forces of nature as explained by the “standard model” of particle physics. Such theories have been exhaustively tested and the recent discovery of the Higgs particle at Cern by the Large Hadron Collider is a marvellous confirmation of these ideas.Yet the incorporation of gravitation into this picture is still something that eludes us. As well as his work on black holes, Stephen was pursuing ideas that he hoped would lead to a unification of gravitation with the other forces of nature in a way that would unite Einstein’s ideas with those of quantum theory. Our work on black holes does indeed shed light on this other puzzle. Sadly, Stephen is no longer with us to share our excitement about the possibility of resolving these issues, which have now been around for half a century.• Malcolm Perry is professor of theoretical physics at the University of Cambridge, and a co-author of the new black hole research.A  Live event celebrating the work of Stephen Hawking, with Jim Al-Khalili, Maggie Aderin-Pocock and others, will take place on Monday 15 October at the Royal Institution in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcbae65b50785eab5afa2c59c26a2a1efcba8a37/66_20_5613_3368/master/5613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5769aecd20eb2a75273727ed0b076414","title":"new social work model named social worker","story":"Named social worker programme has a simple goal: to help people with autism, learning disabilities and mental health conditions lead a good lifePeter* has autism and a learning disability. Over the years, he and his family have had many social workers. Between the ages of four and 10, he had a good support worker, but when she left they lost a connection to someone who knew them well and who they could rely on. Peter’s parents said his social workers “changed with the seasons” often the family met someone once and never saw them again. The social workers would focus on responding to Peter’s immediate needs, but home life for the whole family was becoming increasingly stressful.Things eventually reached crisis point, with police being called to the house on a regular basis. Peter was close to being detained under the Mental Health Act, and likely to be placed in a treatment unit away from home. This was something his family feared happening, but they also worried they wouldn’t be able to keep going the way things were. They felt stuck. Peter wanted to live on his own, but this was not considered a realistic option by either his family or the services involved.At that point, Peter was matched with a named social worker. This pilot programme has worked with 200 people and aims to understand what difference it would make for people supported by services and their families to have continuity, with a main point of contact who helps them navigate and connect with other services. Peter’s named social worker was able to act quickly, arranging temporary accommodation, then working with him and the family to determine the right support. Peter was fully included in the process, as were other key professionals, including speech and language therapists and a learning disability nurse.Today, Peter is settled into a new home that he has decorated with his own artwork. He takes part in food shopping and helps prepare meals, and he goes out for walks, bike rides and to the local disco. Peter is happy, and so are his parents. Having been anxious about his desire to live independently, they can’t believe the change they have seen in him.We initiated the named social worker programme with a simple goal: for people with learning disabilities, autism and mental health conditions to lead a good life. The basic approach was also simple: give these iniduals and their families consistent support through a singl expert social worker who believes in them, advocates for them and helps them pursue their long-term goals.The issues Peter and his family faced are not unique. Opportunities for professionals to truly understand iniduals and help them live the life they want to are often limited by the way services are configured. Relationships are crucial, because without really understanding an inidual, more independent, empowering (and often cheaper) care options just aren’t achievable. Without a trusting relationship between the named social worker, Peter and his family, he wouldn’t be living independently in his own home and he probably would have ended up in an expensive placement, far from his family, friends and the things he enjoys.As one named social worker said: “You can take a longer view, and not just stick a plaster on the issues. You have time to think through their aspirations, how best to support them to be independent in the long term, not just for the next year or so.”For me, the programme is about releasing professionals to practise good social work, which means delivering the kind of care they want to give and being able to use their professional judgment, creativity and resourcefulness to do the right thing.There are lessons for the wider system too, such as the importance of peer learning and supervision in enabling social workers to advocate for iniduals, solve problems and engage in positive risk-taking. Local authorities involved in the pilot say the named social worker approach has contributed to faster discharges, more stable placements and improved collaborative working. While evidence continues to emerge from this programme and beyond, I believe a strong case is being made that investing in relationships is not an unaffordable luxury. It’s a wise decision for people, those who support them, and for the longer-term sustainability of our public services.* Not his real name• Lyn Romeo is chief social worker for adults at the Department for Health and Social Care"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d842f6e63ca80a283cf44a7126172e84b3d441d1/0_200_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66a146224325fe3fbe78dcbf990edb18","title":"record number of 10 and 11 year olds severely obese","story":"Official data puts one in 25 children in year 6 in England in highest category of being overweightA record number of 10- and 11-year-olds in England are classed as “severely obese”, official figures show.One in 25 children in year 6 of primary school are now so dangerously overweight that they are in that category, according to the latest annual findings of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP).Children classed as severely obese have a body mass index on or above the 99.6th percentile for their age and gender. The proportion of year 6 pupils in that category has risen by more than a third since 2006-07.The figures, based on weighing and measuring more than a million schoolchildren, are the definitive measure of children’s weight in England.Children’s doctors said the figures were “totally unacceptable”, adding that more children and families should be able to attend weight management sessions.Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, praised ministers for setting out plans to tackle childhood obesity – for example, by banning junk food advertisements on television before the 9pm watershed.Public Health England, which oversees the NCMP, warned that children who were too heavy were at greater risk of suffering from poor self-esteem, bullying and stigma when they were young. They also stood a much greater chance of becoming adults who were overweight or obese, which increases the risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.Steve Brine, the public health minister, said that reversing the very worrying trends in childhood obesity would take a long time.“Obesity is a problem that has been decades in the making – one that will take significant effort across government, schools, families and wider society to address. We cannot expect to see a reversal in trends overnight. But we have been clear that we are willing to do whatever it takes to keep children healthy and well in this country,” Brine said.He pointed to the fact that as a result of the tax on sugary drinks that began UK-wide in April sugar levels in many products had been cut and money from the levy was being used to fund school sport and breakfast clubs.Theresa May has pledged to halve childhood obesity by 2030, though medical and public health bodies and charities have said government plans did not go far enough and relied too much on food manufacturers voluntarily reducing sugar levels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e7e9bdeae636f9365666c21ac7b02d443ea71e/0_55_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca9be0ffbf1c1273b53d449b139fa2db","title":"nathan hughes in dark over england future after delay in disciplinary case wasps rugby union","story":"• Wasps No 8 tweets then deletes: ‘What a joke’ during hearing• Forward facing charge for punching Gloucester’s LudlowNathan Hughes’s chances of featuring in England’s autumn internationals have been damaged after a comment made on Twitter during his disciplinary hearing on Wednesday landed the Wasps No 8 in more hot water.In a bizarre turn of events, Hughes’s hearing for punching Gloucester’s Lewis Ludlow in the head was postponed on Wednesday after more than four hours. The hearing started at 7pm and at 8.37pm, Hughes tweeted: “What a joke” – seemingly a criticism of the disciplinary proceedings – before swiftly deleting it.At 11.21pm the Rugby Football Union released a statement confirming the panel would reconvene within a week and it is understood the issue that arose is Hughes’s tweet. Hughes is suspended until the panel reconvenes – ruling him out of Wasps’ Champions Cup match against Leinster on Friday – and he may yet face an additional charge of “conduct prejudicial to the interests of the game” from the Rugby Football Union for his comment.Even if he does not, he is still facing the prospect of a six-week ban for punching Ludlow because any foul play that results in contact with the head means an automatic mid-range sanction. At the very least, his tweet would harm his chances of having any ban reduced for mitigating circumstances and it could result in a suspension being increased.A six-week ban would likely rule Hughes out of England’s first three autumn internationals – against South Africa, New Zealand and Japan – but it could also mean he misses out against Australia as well if Wasps are unable to argue successfully that their Premiership Rugby Cup fixture on 27 October should count towards any ban.Hughes’s absence would be a blow for Jones, who is already without the injured Exeter No 8 Sam Simmonds for the autumn. It would place even greater importance on the fitness of Billy Vunipola, who completed his first 80 minutes of the season last Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddc25e8df48da7c54ff37beef2264260b25f3adf/0_88_4767_2860/master/4767.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8df55d0cc95bd33b1fd208df9c189ca1","title":"european champions cup 2018 19 pool by pool","story":"A pool featuring four former winners and 11 titles in total, but it’s hard to see anything other than Leinster topping it with ease. Indeed, few would bet against them claiming a fifth title in May and becoming Europe’s most successful side, having pulled level with Toulouse last season. Back-to-back fixtures against Bath will be intriguing considering the club stalwart Girvan Dempsey now looks after the West Country side’s attack but they, along with Wasps and Toulouse, appear to be scrapping for second place. Todd Blackadder has cited the Champions Cup as the reason his squad took such a hit last season so it may be that Bath do not prioritise the latter rounds if unlikely to qualify, whereas Toulouse have begun the season brightly, with something of a return to their commitment to free-flowing rugby. Wasps have been hit by injuries in key positions at just the wrong time.Key player Tadhg Furlong (Leinster). Probably the best tighthead in the world. Mixes brute force with telling contributions in the loose and is a fine scrummager. Exeter, another year older and wiser, have the capacity to go deep in the competition. Rob Baxter has been thin king about the Chiefs’ opening fixture, at home to Munster, for a while now and created the depth that has allowed him to rotate in the Premiership while still winning six from six. Put simply, their pack is monstrous and so clashes with Castres will not be for the faint-hearted. The Top 14 champions are likely to fare better than normal, mainly because they have previously shown little regard for the competition, but they are considerably hamstrung by Benjamín Urdapilleta’s absence. Munster have the knowhow to pip them to second place with Joey Carbery pulling the strings while Gloucester are unlikely to advance but will be better for the experience next season. Conor Murray (Munster). Mystery continues to surround his neck injury – we do not even know how much of the competition he will play in – but he brings such a composure to Munster when available.Saracens appear to be the side best placed to challenge Leinster and should prove far too strong for their pool rivals. Glasgow can dazzle on their day – particularly if Adam Hastings can continue his fine form – but Saracens’ start to the season has been ominous. You worry for Cardiff Blues in their double-header against the English champions and Lyon have a scrum-half crisis. Carl Fearns and Liam Gill are back-rowers of considerable repute and you would not bet against the former producing his best against Saracens but, as debutants, it is hard to see the French side advancing. Perhaps Glasgow will, having got things badly wrong in Dave Rennie’s first season in charge – he is too good a coach to make the same mistakes. There will be plenty of tries in this pool, too, with three of the four sides playing their home matches on artificial pitches.Key player Billy Vunipola (Saracens). He made 28 carries in his first 80 minutes of the season last week to suggest he is slowly but surely finding his form of old. He’s a way off yet but it would not be surprising if European action brings it out of him.Racing 92 are comfortably France’s best hope of success, having lost a nail-biting final to Leinster in May. They have the depth to go that far again and the new arrivals Finn Russell and Simon Zebo (dubbed facteur X et facteur Z by one French newspaper) have both made fine starts to life in Paris. Their opening fixture away to the Scarlets feels decisive as to whether they will top their pool and will be instructive as to whether the Welsh side have changed their approach, having been such a joy to watch last season until Leinster squeezed the life out of them. They have back-row problems with John Barclay departed and James Davies injured, while Tadhg Beirne, a revelation in this competition last season, has left for Munster. It is hard to see the other two sides in the pool, Leicester and Ulster, advancing – both are former winners but both are under new management and have fundamental issues to resolve.Key player Jonathan Davies (Scarlets). Hopefully his injury problems are behind him because he has the class to ensure the Scarlets’ success story of last season repeats itself.Perhaps the hardest pool to call. Newcastle did so well to qualify in the first place but after their difficult start to the season you wonder if they can afford not to prioritise the Premiership. Edinburgh are in a similar overachieving boat but Richard Cockerill’s sides are not known for rolling over. Toulon have begun their season disastrously despite the arrivals of their illustrious signings Julian Savea and Liam Messam, with the owner, Mourad Boudjellal, seeking five new arrivals to resolve his side’s problems. They do have a rich European history and maybe the Champions Cup will bring the best out of the them but Montpellier will fancy their chances of advancing having been outgunned by Leinster and Exeter last season. Vern Cotter has considerable fly-half problems, though, with Aaron Cruden, Frans Steyn and Johan Goosen all injured.Key player Duhan van der Merwe (Edinburgh). He may not end up making it to the knockout stages but Edinburgh’s hulking South African winger is one to keep an eye on. He struggled to make an impact at Montpellier but is shining in Scotland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c480ae3afb2fdc9a4484b043c0defe92fae1a8b9/0_131_2202_1321/master/2202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a191549c7ece1e15bbcdc8ef84af10","title":"jamie jones suspended world snooker allegations match fixing","story":"Jamie Jones has been suspended from the World Snooker tour with immediate effect over allegations he was involved in match-fixing.The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) has banned Jones, the world No 39, pending a disciplinary hearing.The 30-year-old is alleged to have been “party to, or facilitated, the manipulation of the outcome” of a match between David John and Graeme Dott at Preston’s International Championship Qualifiers on 29 September, 2016.Dott beat John 6-1 in the match.

As with Griff Rhys Jones a few months back, so now with Joanna Lumley: a small-screen celeb taking to the stage to talk through clips of things we’ve already seen them do on TV (top-price tickets: £62.50). They seldom make for gripping live performance, and sometimes – tonight, for example – descend into tedious love-ins, as Lumley fields written questions (“Will you marry me?”, “Can I have a kiss?”) submitted by her crowd.The entire second act is given over to these questions, mediated by Lumley’s sometime TV producer Clive Tulloh. You might think the Q\u0026ampA format would occasion spontaneity on Lumley’s part. And so it does, to a very small degree. The rest, though, is contrivance, as the audience’s questions are corralled to fit around her precooked anecdotes and clips.No one’s complaining, mind you, because Lumley has such a rich back catalogue to dip into. If tonight’s potted history proves anything, it’s that she has had a remarkable career and that her national-treasure status is built on solid foundations. Act one takes us from convent school drama class via swinging 60s modelling work (archive interview footage suggests Lumley’s confidence and charisma emerged fully formed) right up to Ab Fab self-satire.Her Zelig-like tale features interventions in seemingly every pop-culture phenomenon of the era (James Bond! Steptoe \u0026amp Son! Hammer horror! Coronation Street!), each one apostrophised with a “gosh, it was exciting!” or an “it was all fabulous and wonderful!” There are few insights and plenty of droll anecdotes, be it the one about the helicopter stunt on The Avengers, or turning her bra into shoes for TV castaway show Girl Friday. (“Gosh, I loved it!”)From travel jaunts with the queen’s cousin to partying with Trump, It’s All About Me is a bit gilded for my tastes. But Lumley remains charming company, ever ready to send herself up – as per the story of being starstruck by Leonardo DiCaprio. It’s enjoyable enough – if 50 quid more expensive than a night in with YouTube and her autobiography."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ac770d86772749fb3f91b44b31e945cad59bf4/0_0_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e872c565eb67a2eefd5cf6f29276d69","title":"lenovo thinkpad x1 tablet review surface pro usb c","story":"Great screen, robust design, brilliant keyboard and Thunderbolt 3 make the third-generation ThinkPad X1 Tablet a potent combinationLenovo’s third-generation ThinkPad X1 Tablet aims to be a no-compromise Windows 10 detachable that gives users what Microsoft’s Surface won’t: USB-C and Thunderbolt 3.The form factor is familiar. The actual computer is squeezed into an 8.9mm thick tablet with a kickstand out the back and a magnetically attached keyboard that sits up on an angle for better typing.But here Lenovo departs from the winning minimalist Surface 2-in-1 formula, bringing ThinkPad staples such as a pointing nipple, trackpad buttons, bucket-shaped keyboard keys and optional road-warrior appealing 4G.That’s not to say this is a pure workhorse, but the matt-black paint job, ancient-looking ThinkPad logo and red highlights certainly give the impression this machine is about getting stuff done.On the back is a solid-feeling kickstand with a wide angle of motion, which is just as good as that on the back of the Surface Pro, and perfect for getting the right angle on your lap or desk.The front-facing speakers are perhaps a weak point for using the X1 Tablet as a media machine, because although they are relatively clear and distortion-free, they’re also not very loud and lack any sort of bass. They’ll be fine if you’re hand-holding the machine to watch a TV show, but watching something while cooking and hearing what’s going on over an extractor fan is a no-go.The X1 Tablet is designed to be more durable than most. The screen is covered in a sheet of Gorilla Glass, like most of the competition, but the ThinkPad line has a history of going the extra mile in testing against humidity, vibration and mechanical shock, meaning it should cope with the everyday jolts and jostles of commuting.The X series is Lenovo’s top-end ThinkPad line, which means the X1 Tablet comes with all the power you’re likely to want.That includes your choice of the latest eighth-generation quad-core Intel i5 or i7 processor, 8 or 16GB of RAM and plenty of storage.The machine as tested had a Intel Core i7-8550U processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and 4G, and absolutely flew through everything I threw at it.While the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics card may be the weakest point of the X1 Tablet, the machine managed to handle some enormous 23,000-pixel wide images without breaking too much of a sweat.The fans in the tablet fire up more often than some competitors, but they also don’t get particularly loud unless you’re doing something very processor-intensive. Most of the time they’re inaudible in an office environment.Overall performance is excellent, matching that of a high-end ultraportable machine, but don’t expect to do hardcore gaming on it – I didn’t try it with an external graphics card.One of the things that’s sacrificed in most PC tablets is battery life. Lenovo quotes “more-than-all-day” battery life of nine-and-a-half hours, but the reality is the ThinkPad X1 Tablet lasts only around seven hours between charges. That was with the “Better battery life” power setting active, word processing in Typora, browsing in Chrome, using Nextgen reader, some image editing in Affinity Photo and lots of email in Microsoft Mail.It’s enough to get through most of a day’s work, but isn’t enough to leave the charger at home on intensive days. Thankfully as it uses USB Power Delivery to charge, any USB-C charger with sufficient wattage should work such as those shipped with other laptops or even multi-chargers putting out 30W or more.The X1 Tablet comes with just two Thunderbolt 3 ports that double as USB-C ports. Having Thunderbolt 3 is a huge boon as the expansion capabilities are endless, including the holy grail of one cord to charge, connect a 4K monitor and every other peripheral you can think of. It’s a significant advantage over competitors that lack even USB-C.However, having only two ports, one of which will be needed for power, means you will rely on docks or hubs. It’s not such a big deal for most, but a bit of port-juggling is inevitable if you don’t invest in a dock of some sort.There’s also a microSD card reader, which is great, but it’s hidden in a sim-slot similar to that which you would find on a smartphone. It’s not practical as a hot-swappable memory card reader as you need a sim ejector tool to get it out, and it means ejecting the 4G sim if you’ve got one at the same time.Unlike Microsoft’s Surface Pro, the X1 Tablet comes with a keyboard, and what a keyboard it is. Windows 10 detachables such as this live or die by the quality of the keyboards, as most of the time they’re used like a laptop.Lenovo’s keyboard is the best I have used on any detachable, and better than the vast majority of laptops. The keys are full-sized, solid, feel great under your fingers and have enough travel to make for a comfortable, satisfying typing experience.The trackpad is equally good. It’s pretty big, has a smooth, precise surface and a solid click to it, as well as plenty of options to customise the experience. But there’s also a ThinkPad stalwart in the form of the little red nipple TrackPoint between the G, H and B keys, and three mouse buttons between the spacebar and the trackpad. I found little use for them except when on a train where the end of the keyboard was pressed up into my gut by the zero legroom blocking the trackpad.The keyboard does have its quirks, such as the Fn key in the bottom left corner instead of Ctrl, something I had to almost immediately switch round in settings for muscle-memory cut and paste. There aren’t any media keys either.The X1 Tablet has an IR-based facial recognition system that’s just as good as that on Microsoft’s Surface line. It recognises you from the lock-screen and automatically logs you in, making login seamless.There’s also a fingerprint scanner, which has a slightly odd combination of tapping and swiping for registering your fingerprint, but works well in day-to-day operation. I didn’t end up using it at the desk as the face recognition worked so well, but it was useful for unlocking the tablet when handheld in portrait orientation, and the more biometric options the better.The machine as tested cost £1,973.59 with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and 4G.The ThinkPad X1 Tablet proves that Lenovo can make a great detachable 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet computer. It’s not cheap, but offers similar or better specifications than its chief rival the Microsoft Surface Pro, including the much-needed modern port selection of Thunderbolt 3.The X1 Tablet feels like it can take a beating and will survive the rigours of mobile working, which is what it was designed for. The screen is great, and at 13in is an ideal size, the kickstand and keyboard are brilliant and performance is top-notch.The seven-hour battery life could be better, but the integrated 4G and two biometric options are welcome additions. It’s still a better machine for work than play, but it is good enough to pull double duty unless all you want to do is watch videos from across the room.If you’re in the market for a top-end 2-in-1 Windows 10 detachable, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet should be on your list.Cons: only two USB-C ports, microSD card reader not easily accessible, expensive This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

As I am looking for an alternative to Google, Microsoft and the other big names, Graphite stood out. However, it uses blockchain, and one thing that I do not find encouraging is the amount of energy it consumes.So my question is: from an energy point of view, is there much difference between cloud and blockchain?The electricity I use at home is from renewable sources. MartinThe main aim of the decentralised web (DWeb) is to remove the power of centralised “gatekeepers” such as Facebook and Google, who hoover up the world’s data and monetise it by selling advertising. It reminds me of the original concept of the web, where every computer would be both a client and a server, sharing information on a more or less equal basis.Of course, that is not how real life works. What actually happens is that you get a power law distribution with a few large entities and a long tail of small ones.As Clay Shirky wrote in 2003: “In systems where many people are free to choose between many options, a small subset of the whole will get a disproportionate amount of traffic (or attention, or income), even if no members of the system actively work towards such an outcome. This has nothing to do with moral weakness, selling out, or any other psychological explanation. The very act of choosing, spread widely enough and freely enough, creates a power law distribution.”The web still has plenty of variety, but almost everyone is familiar with one giant search engine, one giant retailer, one giant auction site, one giant social network, one giant encyclopaedia, and so on. Indeed, there is only one giant internet where there used to be dozens of competing networks using many different protocols.Obviously, it would be better if we all agreed these things in advance, based on open standards. However, people vote with their wallets, and competition results in de facto standards instead of de jure ones. Examples include Microsoft Windows, Google Search and Facebook. Each triumphed in a competitive marketplace.I am not saying this is the ideal solution, just that, in most cases, it’s inevitable.One of the problems with returning to a decentralised web is that the internet is no longer decentralised. It has been redesigned around giant server farms, high-speed pipes and content delivery networks. It looks increasingly like a broadband television network because that is what it actually does most of the time.Today’s web is being optimised for the delivery of Netflix movies, BBC programmes on iPlayer, Spotify music, live streams of every major sporting event, and so on. You can upload your own live streams but communications are asynchronous: your downloads are much faster, and much more reliable, than your uploads. It’s really easy to watch 1TB of movies but an exercise in frustration trying to upload a 1TB hard-drive backup.If you really want to save energy and internet resources, stop streaming stuff. Broadcast TV and radio can reach tens of millions of people, and adding another million adds relatively little in the way of extra power consumption. There is school of thought that it is better for the environment to use CDs or DVDs for albums or films you go back to again and again, or you could at least use digital files stored on your PC or smartphone.And rather than using Graphite to replace Google Docs or Microsoft Office, just use a word processor offline. If you run Windows, you already have a text editor (Notepad) and a simple word processor (WordPad), and there are plenty of free alternatives. That will reduce global energy use and increase your privacy.It’s really simple. If you don’t want Google to read your documents, don’t write your documents on Google’s computers. And if you don’t want cloud servers using energy, don’t use the cloud.Companies such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft and Google are covering the world with server farms to make information more easily available. That’s harder to do with real distributed systems because the thousands or millions of separate computers may be turned off or otherwise unavailable when you need the data they are storing. Worse, unless it’s replicated, you could lose data.It’s true that server farms consume an ever-growing amount of electricity, much of it used for cooling purposes. However, the cost is a powerful incentive for operators to use cheaper renewables, such as solar panels, and to reduce their power consumption in other ways. For example, Facebook has built a data centre in the north of Sweden where the air is freezing cold, while Microsoft is experimenting with underwater data centres that are easier to cool.Microsoft is also sponsoring tree planting in Ireland as part of its commitment to becoming carbon neutral.A properly decentralised web, based on tens of millions of small servers, would not have the same incentives to cut energy use, nor the same economies of scale. And in reality, I expect DWeb will use the same giant data centres as everybody else.Bitcoin is having a terrible impact on the world’s energy consumption, and may use almost as much as Austria (8.2GW) by the end of this year. This is despite bitcoin mining making the usual transition from widely distributed – anyone with a PC could do it – to specialised equipment in data centres. However, it’s irrelevant to Graphite and, I suspect, to the rest of DWeb.Thankfully, GraphiteDocs does not use the Bitcoin blockchain to store anything except your identity. This is the result of Graphite’s decision to use the Blockstack application development system. Apart from that, Graphite uses its own virtual blockchain.To get started, you use the Blockstack browser to register your name on the Bitcoin blockchain. Once you’ve done that, you can use Graphite and other Blockstack apps. There are 34 in the app store. (Gaia is Blockstack’s decentralised storage system.)Graphite itself has two obvious advantages. First, all your files are encrypted. Second, you can store them wherever you like. By default, Graphite uses Microsoft’s Azure cloud, but you can connect to Dropbox, Google Drive or some other service.Your files are encrypted so the storage provider can’t read them, and they can’t be censored.The distributed web is being promoted by people I admire, including web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the Internet Archive’s Brewster Kahle and Mozilla’s Mitchell Baker. It also has a valid reason to exist: people really should own and control their own data, not just labour as unpaid serfs for surveillance capitalism. However, most people follow the line of least resistance, so the web is not going to change overnight.Services like Graphite are worth considering if you need both encryption and the ability to share secure files online, though there are other ways to do this, such as Boxcryptor and Whisply. DWeb apps will need to become easier to use and mobile before they can reach a mass market.But I can’t see any savings in energy consumption compared with just using a cloud service.Have you got a question?

The bright, airy dining room amply accommodated the racket and mess that accompanied our family of four and we enjoyed a decent meal. What stood out was how accommodating they were of our daughter’s severe allergies – to dairy, eggs and peanuts. Despite these restrictions, she was served a full three-courses without the compromises to which we have become accustomed. A dairy- and egg-free chocolate brownie was a treat rarely found outside our own kitchen. ViranWe regularly visit Owd Nell’s at Billsborrow as a family. It’s super-friendly, reasonable and caters for kids and dogs. On a pretty stretch of canal between Preston and Garstang, close to the M6 junction for Blackpool, it’s wonderful outside in summer and, with a roaring fire, cosy indoors in winter. Kids meals cost from £2 to £5, adult mains from £9 to £17. It serves huge portions, and there’s regular free entertainment, like a balloon animal guy who makes his way from table to table, and owl displays. In season, mother ducks potter around the grounds with their ducklings, which the kids love. You can stay the night in one of the rooms in their thatched hamlet (from £55).

It provides children’s activities in school holidays such as Easter egg painting, rock painting and letters to Santa. The children’s menu is basic (£5.50 for main course) but they’ve always been happy to offer a smaller portion of the main menu when I’ve asked. It serves children good pastas, pizza, lightly battered plaice goujons (all £5.50) and for toddlers, mini plates of cheesy mash and beans for just £2.50. Dishes are adaptable with seasonal veg added where requested and staff have always been happy to give an extra plate for sharing. The place is really family – and dog –friendly.Sharon HookingsPizzatipi in Cardigan, west Wales, is a great place to relax. In a courtyard overlooking the Teifi estuary are two fire pits, covered by a large canopy. Families sit at wooden benches in the sunshine or around the fire on chillier evenings. There’s plenty of space for children to play safely, and adults to chat. The stone-baked pizzas are all around £10, using local ingredients, along with focaccia, olives and brownies. It also serves Welsh craft beers, wine and local gin. Does great coffee too.elisaThe Dumpling Monkey in Glasgow is a great spot to take the kids. The handmade dumplings (£5 for bowl of 10 – vegetarian options and choice of fillings) are a must, and the kids particularly enjoy the self-service approach with chopsticks, little bowls and being able to use their own dips. The staff are very helpful, it has high chairschange facilities and the service is fast.Tilly McintyreAlthough hipster Whitstable draws the crowds, neighbouring Tankerton is no less inviting. It boasts an enticing spot that the little ones can call a den of their own. On the High Street, the Bears Trading Company beckons with toy bears of all sizes and persuasions. The cafe brims with whimsy, from its cheeky cards and wall hangings, delicious ice-creams, cakes and shakes, a small but tasty home-style savoury menu (fish finger sandwiches, ploughman’s lunch, soups) and a surprisingly spacious interior, with a pretty patio in back. The friendly, helpful staff welcome all ages, and dogs. Prices range from £2 for a piece of cake to around £5 for sandwiches.Bruce EmondThe Jolly Fisherman was a great find during a recent holiday. The staff in the dining room overlooking the sea were so welcoming and helpful when we arrived with a one-year-old. Although there is not a children’s menu, they will do half- portions of all their main meals and were more than happy to create a meal that our son would eat.

Local ingredients are used and the quality, whenever I’ve been, is superb. Staff appear very aware of allergies, so you know you are in safe hands. There’s not only the typical children’s menu, but also a vegetarian children’s menu and children’s desserts. The pub is dog-friendly (that includes the bedrooms), which is good to know if you are travelling with the complete family.NoeliaSaddleback Farm Café, between Wantage and Newbury, is on the glorious North Wessex Downs. Sunday brunch is a particular favourite with our young boys. The cafe’s Piglets menu uses the same local, fresh produce as the adults, no compromises, while the cakes and biscuits produced on the Aga are loved by all generations. The outside play area, with ride-on miniature tractors, is a big draw. Welcoming, patient staff often provide a free drink for breastfeeding mums and can suggest buggy-friendly walks from the door, perhaps to meet deer and partridges. The cafe hosts regular family events throughout the year. fionaFamilies headed to London’s South Bank don’t need to restrict themselves to one of its many chain restaurants. Instead, pick something up from the Southbank Centre Food Market, on Belvedere Road behind Royal Festival Hall, which has dishes from all over the world. Then head to the Southbank Centre and the river: there’s always something interesting for kids to see – fountains, boats on the sailing by, live music – and there are plenty of tables to sit at. At weekends there tend to be loads of kids running around and generally having a ball in the downstairs stage area of the Royal Festival Hall. There’s even a lift directly up to the hall from the market for families with buggies.

Crews in Florida and Alabama had begun restoring some power after the worst of the storm blew through.The Florida Highway Patrol has closed 80 miles of Interstate 10, the main highway running through the Florida panhandle from east to west, to clear storm debris.Spokesman Eddie Elmore told the Associated Press the road was closed “due to extremely hazardous conditions.”The road is closed west of Tallahassee, and it’s not clear when it will reopen.Gov. Rick Scott urged Floridians Thursday morning to stay off the roads and keep them clear for emergency responders and utility crews.The tiny town of Mexico Beach, Florida took the brunt of Hurricane Michael, which made landfall nearby with winds at 155mph.Entire homes were destroyed by driving winds, while others were completely submerged by water.A reporter and photographer from the Tampa Bay Times reached the town of 1,200 early Thursday. They reported that fires were burning uncontrolled, with no one to put them out. Entire homes were gone, with only stairs left leading to houses that no longer exist.The town was nearly impassable, with the main highway covered with downed trees and debris. Refrigerators, toilets and staircases from destroyed home where scattered wherever they were dropped by the wind.Rex Putnal, a Mexico Beach City Council member, told CNN communications are down and city employees can’t even get into town to assess the damage.“I don’t have any sense of any casualties,” he said.Putnal said he has not returned to Mexico Beach, and advised residents not to until it is safe. His own home was built in the 1950s. “I’m not sure if it’s still there,” he told CNN.He added of Mexico Beach, “It is forever changed, probably.”’s Jamiles Lartey is in Marianna, Florida and has lost communications so far this morning.

We’re getting the rain bands coming through now. I can’t watch TV at all, no power at the hotel I’m in, but that doesn’t surprise me. But I’ve never experienced anything like this before.”Amid reports that people near the coast had barricaded themselves inside to stop the wind blowing down doors and walls, NBC’s Lester Holt and his crew were seen putting a mattress over the window of their hotel room. In a room above, which he said belonged to one of his producers, the window blew in, clearly with enough force to scatter shards of glass right across the room. There was no one in the room at the time.Lartey, 72 miles inland from Mexico Beach, where the direct hit was experienced, had duct tape with him to put over the windows but in the end did not need it. Last night just before 11PM he wrote: “Have heard five to six glass breaks in the last 90 minutes. The roof at the hotel across from me is shredded. The sign, too.”At times as the wind roared, Lartey had to retreat behind the bed in his hotel room for safety. His window held. “We’re past the hurricane force winds now,” he said, before his communications went out. With day breaking, we’ll bring you more news from Jamiles when we hear from him. The center of Michael is now moving over South Carolina, according to the latest update from the National Hurricane Center.Michael is now a tropical storm, driving sustained winds of 50mph.The storm is about 40 miles northwest of Columbia, South Carolina.While the storm weakened considerably since it tore through Florida as a category 4 hurricane, it is now hitting areas that were already reeling from Hurricane Florence.The center of Michael will continue to move across central South Carolina this morning, then move across portions of central and eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia this afternoon andthis evening, according to the Hurricane Center. After that, it’s expected to blow back out into the Atlantic Ocean.Parts of North Carolina’s outer banks, which were hard hit by Florence, could see storm surge of two to four feet from Michael. Tropical storm conditions are now occurring over portions of eastern and southeastern Georgia and South Carolina, and will spread northward across central and eastern portions of North Carolina today.After devastating the Florida Panhandle, Hurricane Michael headed for Georgia and the Carolinas late Wednesday.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

It says its website has nothing to do with denunciation. According to Bernd Baumann, a leading member of the AfD’s parliamentary group, it is a chance to address the considerable evidence the party said it had collected, showing that schools were often drawing “a very severe picture of the AfD as radical, inhuman and cold”.The party has encouraged pupils to look out for “cloddish AfD bashing”, including those wearing bags, badges or T-shirts bearing the slogan “FCK AfD”, as well as pointing out anything that might be recognisable as political indoctrination.Uwe Böken, a headteacher from Geilenkirchen, said he was denounced by the AfD after he invited the surviving member of a girls’ orchestra that was imprisoned in Auschwitz to talk to his school. Böken voiced his concerns during her visit that people with far-right views were sitting in the German parliament for the first time since the second world war.A disciplinary complaint was brought against Böken by the AfD. Even before it was ruled that Böken had not broken the neutrality code, he was denounced by party members across social media.“What’s happening with this portal is pure denunciation,” Böken told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. Böken has taken his case up with the justice ministry. “You just have to look at a history book or also at the present day, to recognise this as something belonging to systems with a clear totalitarian character,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ac583c5d91e2bd19658a279896d6a0eed67b8c5/0_140_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ccac2877665b9791ec2de06895c9db6","title":"salvadoran priest oscar romero saint pope francis canonisation","story":"The canonisation of the assassinated archbishop will take place on Sunday in RomeOscar Romero, the Salvadoran priest who championed social justice for the poor and dispossessed, will be proclaimed a saint by Pope Francis in a canonisation ceremony in Rome on Sunday, almost four decades after he was assassinated by a rightwing death squad.The former archbishop of San Salvador, who was closely associated with the Latin American liberation theology movement of the 1960s and 70s, will be canonised along with six others at the ceremony in St Peter’s Square. They include Pope Paul VI, who oversaw the sweeping Vatican II reforms of the Catholic church in the 1960s.For years, conservatives within the church sought to block Romero’s canonisation because of his association with liberation theology, a movement whose followers argued that it was not enough for the church to empathise with and care for the poor. Instead, they said, the church needed to push for political and structural changes to eradicate poverty, even – some believed – if this meant supporting armed struggle against oppressors.Clare Dixon, head of the Catholic aid agency Cafod’s Latin America region, said: “Oscar Romero is revered in his native El Salvador. He ranks alongside the likes of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi as one of the most remarkable figures of the 20th century.“His canonisation will give Romero the wider recognition he so richly deserves. He denounced the violence which was tearing his country apart, he spoke out against oppression, and stood against injustice alongside people living in poverty.”Father Robert Pelton, a Romero expert at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, said the Latin American priest was a “wonderful pastoral example to the world”. He added: “I’m surprised how long it took to finally get to the truth about him.”Francis began the process of declaring Romero a saint soon after becoming pope. About 250,000 people attended Romero’s beatification ceremony – the penultimate step towards becoming a saint – in San Salvador in May 2015.Earlier this year, the Vatican’s Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared that a miracle had occurred following Romero’s intercession – the final step before being proclaimed a saint. A 34-year-old pregnant Salvadoran woman, who had been diagnosed as terminally ill, gave birth safely and recovered completely after prayers by her family and her church seeking Romero’s intercession.Romero was shot through the heart by a sniper while celebrating mass in a hospital chapel on 24 March 1980, a day after he had called on the military to stop killing innocent civilians in El Salvador’s dirty war. Numerous death threats had been made against him.At his funeral, the army opened fire, killing dozens of mourners in a crowd of more than 100,000. His murder came at the start of a 12-year civil war, in which more than 75,000 people were killed and thousands disappeared.Dixon said that diplomatic and political pressure had been exerted on the Vatican in the years following his death to block efforts to have Romero made a saint. It was not until after the election of a leftist president in El Salvador in 2009 and Pope Francis becoming pope in 2013 that the issue of Romero’s canonisation was “pulled out of the deep-freeze”.The former archbishop was “revered and reviled, loved and loathed” in El Salvador, “and that continues to be the case in a country which is still deeply polarised,” she said.Nevertheless, the Catholic church would be “going absolutely crazy” this weekend celebrating the canonisation, with parties scheduled for the early hours of the morning to coincide with events in Rome.In his diaries, Romero wrote: “Between the powerful and the wealthy, and the poor and vulnerable, who should a pastor side with? I have no doubts. A pastor should stay with his people.” His sermons, demanding social justice for poor people and excoriating politicians and military leaders, reached hundreds of thousands of people via radio broadcasts.Francis, the first Latin American pope, was never a liberation theologian, and criticised aspects of the movement when he was a priest in Argentina, according to papal biographers. But since becoming pontiff, he has argued that the church must champion the poor and marginalised, and has repeatedly criticised capitalism and consumerism."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660132.1539262801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national emergency group to meet as storm callum approaches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMet Éireann has issued a status orange weather warning for Storm Callum, which will hit Ireland on Thursday night. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe National Emergency Coordination Group is to be convened on Thursday as the State prepares for the arrival of Storm Callum.The national emergency group is made up of officials from various state agencies including the Office of Public Works, Met Éireann, the Department of Defence, the Garda, the Defence Forces and the Coast Guard. It will meet at 3pm to coordinate the State’s preparations and response to the storm.The weather warning has been issued for counties Dublin Louth Wexford Wicklow Meath Cork Waterford Donegal Galway Mayo Sligo Clare and Kerry. The warning is in place from 10pm on Thursday until 9am on Friday.A yellow wind warning is in place for Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Limerick and Tipperary.Met Éireann meteorologist Siobhan Ryan said there is the potential for higher gusts locally.“The strongest winds will be all around the coast of Ireland but with a particular emphasis on Atlantic coastal counties and there will be rain accompanying it too,” she said.“An orange weather warning is not to be underrated, it is a severe weather warning. Late Thursday night until Friday, there is the possibility of localised flooding. You’re going to see some violent gusts up along the coast potentially.“All the obvious things apply - stay away from exposed coasts, drive slowly in the anticipated crosswinds. The trees are still heavily leafed at the moment so there is the potential for further trees to fall.”A yellow weather warning has also been issued by the UK Met Office for Northern Ireland with severe gales expected between 3am on Friday and 12am on Saturday set to cause some disruption.The Met Office cautioned that winds would bring a “small chance of injuries and danger to life from flying debris” and that there was “a slight chance of some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs”. It said some roads may close due to the strong winds and that there was a chance of power cuts.The Met Office also advised people on Northern Irish coastal areas to take care as “large waves” could occur during the storm with beach material being thrown up onto sea fronts.Fingal County Council said on Wednesday night it has activated its Crisis Management Team and Severe Weather Alert Team in response to the status orange severe weather warning issued by Met Éireann.It said the crisis management team had a conference call 6pm on Wednesday which was chaired by Chief Executive Paul Reid. The next meeting is scheduled for 1pm on Thursday.“At the moment Met Éireann is forecasting that strong winds coinciding with high spring tides will affect Ireland with winds gusting between 110 and 130 kmh along coasts. High tide along the Fingal coast during this period will be at approximately 2am on Friday morning so there is the possibility of flooding in vulnerable areas,” it said.It added that council crews will distribute sandbags on Thursday to areas along the coast where flooding might occur and details of sandbag distribution points will be available on Thursday from the council’s operations team on the following numbers: Balbriggan Swords: (01) 89055958905596 and HowthMalahide: (01) 8906260It has asked for reports of people sleeping rough on Thursday evening to be telephoned to 1800 707 707 or posted online at http:www.homelessdublin.iereport-rough-sleeper.Meanwhile the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has asked road users to exercise caution during Storm Callum.Before the storm arrives Thursday will be cloudy and breezy with fresh and gusty winds. The rain in the southwest and west will become widespread during the morning with heavy falls in places and the risk of isolated thunderstorms. Brighter conditions with showers will follow from the southwest during the afternoon and evening. Highest temperatures will be between 13 and 16 degrees.Heavy rain and extremely windy conditions will sweep in off the Atlantic on Thursday night, possibly stormy in some west and northern coastal areas. There will be possibly thundery rain in many places overnight, with strong to gale force southeasterly winds developing, giving way to squally showers and strong to gale force south or southwesterly winds by Friday morning.Coastal flooding is also likely, due to the combination of high seas, high tides, strong winds and low pressure.However, Met Éireann said conditions should abate fairly quickly on Friday afternoon with drier weather developing for a time.Another spell of very heavy, possibly thundery rain will push northwards later on Friday, and rain will be widespread on Friday night and for a time on Saturday but turning drier and fresher later in the day and overnight.Sunday is due to be a bright and fresh day with cooler conditions. There will be sunny spells and scattered showers, with some possibly heavy and prolonged showers in western areas later in the day.Galway City Council says it is installing its “aquadam” at Spanish Arch in the city centre, due to the risk of overtopping of the river Corrib in very high astronomical spring tides.It says its weather assessment team will continue to meet and monitor the potential impact of Storm Callum.During Storm Ali last month, which claimed two lives, wind speeds of over 140kmh were recorded at Mace Head in Connemara early on September 19th, with peak gusts between 7am and 8am. There was much criticism of lack of adequate warnings on the west coast.A Swiss visitor, Elvira Ferrari, who had come to Ireland to learn English, died after the caravan which she was renting was swept off a ledge towards the Atlantic shoreline at a campsite in Claddaghduff outside Clifden.A falling tree killed a man in his 20s and injured a man in his 40s while they were working at a water pumping station in the Slieve Gullion forest park area near Newry, Co Down.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659936.1539247413!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm callum safety tips what you can do to prepare","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIf you have a trampoline, make sure to secure it safely.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneTHE IRISH TIMES Minister for Communications Denis Naughten will face emergency Dáil questions this afternoon over his meetings with a lead bidder for a State-backed €500 million broadband plan.The hurriedly arranged Dáil exchanges were conceded by the Minister early today in the face of mounting anger about his handling of contacts with New York-based businessman David McCourt, the chairman of Granahan McCourt. In the Dáil, Mr Naughten will deliver a 10-minute-long defence of his actions at 3pm before he faces eight minutes of questions each from the seven Opposition groupings in the chamber. In all, the debate will last 75 minutes.Ministers have expressed concern about Minister Mr Naughten’s handling of controversy over meetings he held with the lead bidder for the Government’s National Broadband Plan.One Cabinet member said the “drip feed of information” on meetings between Mr Naughten and David McCourt was “not helpful”. Another said: “If he broke the rules, he’s in trouble.” The issue was described as the “second fool’s pardon he’s looking for”, a reference to a controversy earlier this year over contact between Mr Naughten and a lobbyist working for Independent News and Media.Mr Naughten’s spokeswoman, however, pointed to comments from an official heading up the broadband procurement process who said contacts with Mr McCourt had “no bearing”.Fianna Fáil communications spokesman Timmy Dooley said Mr Naughten should acknowledge the “inappropriateness” of the meetings.The Minister, he added, should answer further Dáil questions on the issue but said the issue was “bigger and wider” than the latest controversy, adding the broadband process was “fatally flawed”. Mr Naughten admitted he met Mr McCourt on two separate occasions and “facilitated” a lunch in the Dáil for him while the procurement process was ongoing. The Minister also paid for the €37 lunch through a direct debit Oireachtas system, which deducts payments from salaries, his spokeswoman said.Mr Naughten was already in hot water for accepting a dinner invitation from Mr McCourt in New York in July, which he attended with several senior officials from his department.Mr McCourt’s company is in line to secure one of the biggest public contracts ever awarded by the State, worth in excess of €500 million, should it succeed in winning the tender.When asked at a post-budget briefing on Wednesday if he had met Mr McCourt on any other occasion during the procurement process, Mr Naughten initially said he didn’t recall.However, after being passed a handwritten note by a senior department official, Mr Naughten corrected his initial statement to say that he had attended a meeting in Dublin with Mr McCourt and the secretary general and the assistant secretary general of the Department of Communications in June."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659150.1539204609!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"polish group using varadkar criticism to highlight lgbt issues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar: During a TV debate in Poland five days after Ireland’s abortion referendum, anti-abortion guest Kaja Godek called the Taoiseach –  and all homosexual people – ‘perverted’. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill If Poles thought “taoiseach” was a difficult to pronounce, Leo Varadkar should familiarise himself with “zboczenie” – the Polish word for perversion.That was the term used to describe him on Polish television last May, five days after Ireland’s abortion referendum.On Yes or No, a popular current affairs show on private broadcaster Polsat, discussion of the Irish vote took an unexpected turn.Host Agnieszka Gozdyra introduced the segment by describing the vote as a revolution in a country “often compared to Poland because . . . of its Catholicism”.By comparison, the host said, Poland’s ongoing campaign to limit abortion – headed by her anti-abortion guest Kaja Godek – indicated Poland was heading in the opposite direction.Ms Godek described the Irish result as the work of “abortionists” censoring Ireland’s anti-abortion campaign before the vote, both on traditional and social media.“I want to say with strong conviction that Ireland cannot be described as a Catholic country,” she said, considering its prime minister was “a self-declared gay, who shows off his bizarre orientation”.As the other panellist laughed, Ms Godek asked “if pre-natal tests show that an embryo is homosexual, can you actually abort it?”Poland is a long way from Ireland on LGBT rights. With no marriage equality or civil partnership, gay rights campaigners sense a growing backlash against them, spearheaded by right-wing lobby groups and backed by the national conservative government.In August, Poland’s interior minister described a gay pride parade as a “march of sodomites”. On Monday another gay pride march, scheduled for this weekend in the eastern city of Lublin, was cancelled by the mayor.A 2015 report by the Council of Europe, the human rights body, complained that Poland’s criminal definition of hate speech does not incorporate sexual orientation as grounds for prosecution.Given this climate, Ms Godek’s remarks have been taken up by group of LGBT people in Poland as an opportunity to seek a court decision on where the line is drawn between freedom of expression and hate speech.For Warsaw law professor Jakub Urbanik, the case is about testing what he calls the “Crying Game defence” – named after Neil Jordan’s 1992 film.“In it the transsexual character says ‘a girl has to draw the line somewhere’,” said Prof Urbanik. “That remark in turn paraphrases eminent English judge Lord Denning. We need to draw a line in Poland.”In general, Polish defamation law allows only the affected person to take action against alleged violations of their personal rights.But there are exceptions. This case hinges on the moment Ms Godek was asked if she was saying all homosexuals – not just Mr Varadkar – were perverted. Her answer: “Yes, yes . . .”In their 50-page filing, submitted on Wednesday, the 16 complainants list legal precedents they see in international and Polish law to allow them – as homosexuals – to sue her as injured parties.In 2004, a Polish priest was awarded damages because he felt defamed by a satirical article about Pope John Paul II. Defamation of the pope, the Polish court ruled, “may violate personal rights . . . of a clergyman who feels bound to the pope”.In a 2016 case, a Nazi concentration camp survivor from Poland won a case against German public broadcaster ZDF for referring mistakenly to “Polish” camps.Court documents filed on Wednesday in Warsaw mention Mr Varadkar at length, but trial procedure in Poland does not require complainants to submit a full list of witnesses at this stage.However, the group behind the legal action are enthusiastic about the idea of inviting the Taoiseach to testify.Marriage equality campaigner Aleksandra Muzinska insists the case is not about whether or not Mr Varadkar’s homosexuality is a “perversion”, but about raising awareness of inequalities faced by Poland’s LGBT community.“I wanted to be part of this lawsuit because I think I have a privilege to represent LGBT people in Poland,” she said, “especially those who don’t have means or opportunity to sue Kaja Godek.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660038.1539257726!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar is in a hurry but brexit may put brakes on election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVaradkar either wants an election, or he wants Fianna Fáil to believe he wants an election. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The The election drumbeats are still in the mid-distance, but they are getting closer.When Leo Varadkar sought to nudge Micheál Martin into resolving the future of the Government - one way or another - during the summer, Martin kicked to touch until after the budget. The ink on the budget book was hardly dry when the ball has been thrown back.Martin doesn’t want an election, but wants Fine Gael to know that he isn’t afraid of having one. A complicating factor is that a goodly chunk of his own party is fed up with the confidence and supply agreement and wants done with it.Both leaders have charged their officials with exploring how new talks can take place.But the gulf between the two sides is already apparent. Varadkar wants the business wrapped up by early November. Martin reckons it’ll only be getting going by then. He wants a review of the current agreement, and only then should substantive new talks on a new agreement between the parties commence. What’s the hurry, he asks. Fianna Fáil has promised to support the Government until the Finance Bill is passed, and that’s not until the middle of December. Plenty of time.But Varadkar is a man in a hurry. If there isn’t a new agreement, he wants the option of a general election this year. He’s riding high in the polls. He doesn’t want, says one his Cabinet ministers, to be “trapped by Fianna Fail”, who could then cause an election in early 2019, with hospitals creaking and homelessness still visibly chronic. The big brake on a 2019 election remains Brexit. There is a view in Fine Gael that after a few inconclusive weeks of negotiations with Fianna Fáil, Varadkar could return from the mooted (but not yet confirmed) special EU summit on Brexit - the one that would seal a deal with the UK, all going well - and immediately run to the country, with a polling date on December 7th.He could, of course. He can call it when he wants. But this timetable ignores the need for whatever deal is agreed (assuming all the time that this is what happens) to be ratified by both the European Parliament and the House of Commons (though not all national parliaments, as some have assumed).Theresa May’s final showdown will not be with her fellow European leaders it will be with her own MPs (and the DUP) in the House of Commons. To put it mildly, that outcome will be uncertain. Which means that Varadkar will be unable to claim that Brexit is “settled” when he returns from Brussels, whatever the outcome.None of this means he can’t call an election - but it does mean that Brexit won’t be completely out of the way. Which in turn means that the premise of calling an election to achieve stability during the Brexit process will be deeply questionable. Frankly, it’s hard to see how he could stand it up. If Varadkar wants a 2019 election, he needs to find an answer to that question. In the meantime, Fianna Fáil will run down the clock on him.

On May 30th, in a television discussion following Ireland’s abortion referendum, Ms Godek said she was not surprised by the outcome of the vote given Ireland’s prime minister had flaunted his “bizarre” sexual orientation and shown “his perversion to the people”.Asked by the host if she was saying homosexuals were perverted, Ms Godek continued: “Yes, yes. If the prime minister of Ireland declares that he has a male sexual partner, if it is accepted as normal, it is monstrous that such a country should be defined as a Catholic country.”In later remarks she described Mr Varadkar’s homosexuality as an “ailment”, prompting a robust response from co-panellist Katarzyna Piekarska, a left-wing politician and Warsaw city councillor.“You should be ashamed of yourself that you define a person with a different orientation as a pervert,” she said.Ms Godek is co-founder of the Life and Family Foundation, behind two recent attempts to tighten Poland’s already restrictive abortion laws.She is being sued by 16 lesbian women and gay men, including LGBT rights activists and professors of law, who say they are injured parties.Aleksandra Muzinska, a co-president of the Love Does Not Exclude movement, described Ms Godek as “a symbol of homophobia in Poland”.“She is becoming more aggressive and we are trying to stop her because enough is enough,” she said. Polish campaigners said on Wednesday they were aware of the demands on Mr Varadkar’s time.“But it would be absolutely great to have him here to testify,” said Ms Muzinska. “Even a public statement would be very helpful.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv footage shows jamal khashoggi walking into saudi consulate","story":"  October 10, 2018Turkish investigators say Saudi leadership ordered murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi   October 11, 2018Turkish officials believe Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Saudi consulate in Istanbul "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000177321713_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"never forget face long dont see 5000 lifetime study university","story":"People can remember up to 10,000 faces, with the average person able to recall around 5,000, a new study has found.For the first time, psychologists have devised a method for estimating how many faces a person can remember.The “facial vocabulary” comprises both people known personally to an inidual and famous faces such as those of celebrities and politicians.A team at York University developed a laboratory technique based on a theory called recognition and recall that showed everyone fell within the 1,000 to 10,000 range.This is despite humans typically living and interacting in groups of smaller than 100 throughout evolution.For the study, 25 participants spent an hour writing down as many faces from their personal lives as possible, including those they went to school with, colleagues and family.They then did the same for famous faces.The participants found it easy to come up with lots of faces at first, but harder to think of new ones by the end of the hour.That change of pace allowed the researchers to estimate when they would run out of faces completely.The participants were also shown thousands of photographs of famous people, such as Barack Obama, and asked which ones they recognised.The researchers required participants to recognise two different photos of each person to ensure consistency.How good is your memory? Take our test to find outDr Rob Jenkins, who led the research, said: “The ability to distinguish different iniduals is clearly important - it allows you to keep track of people\u0027s behaviour over time, and to modify your own behaviour accordingly.The range could be explained by some people having a natural aptitude for remembering faces.There are differences in how much attention people pay to faces, and how efficiently they process the information.Alternatively, it could reflect different social environments - some participants may have grown up in more densely populated places with more social input.Tories risk repeat of poll tax backlash over Universal Credit roll out, warns Sir John MajorFaux leather promoted by \u0026#39ethical designers\u0026#39 like Stella McCartney is polluting the oceans with plastic, BBC expert saysComment: Tony Blair just made an incredible offer on Brexit – and you won’t want to miss outCoward or following protocol: What would you have done in Sir Craig Mackey\u0026#39s shoes?Royal wedding guest list: Who have Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank invited?Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding: Time, date, details and latest newsComment: The arranged marriage between Theresa May and the DUP could be heading for orceTransgender prisoner born a male who sexually assaulted female inmates after being jailed for rape is sentenced to life Astronauts make emergency landing after Russian rocket carrying them to International Space Station failsIndia scrambles to control Zika outbreakComment: It\u0026#39s companies, not just the Government, that should be making the case for capitalismHares are dying mysteriously amid fears myxomatosis has \u0026#39jumped\u0026#39 from rabbits, UEA study saysMuch Ado About Shakespeare episode 11: Behind the Scenes of Troilus and CressidaUK could be forced to hand over to Azerbaijan millions from Harrods \u0026#39big spender\u0026#39 Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s new Rolls-Royce shows North Korean sanctions are \u0026#39a bit of a joke\u0026#39Cambridge University students vote against Remembrance Sunday motion over fears it \u0026#39glorifies\u0026#39 warPrincess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding procession route: Where to watch the newlywedsSkateboarder who attacked London Bridge terrorists to be given posthumous bravery awardRates of severe obesity soaring among children, new figures showMeet Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s bridesmaids and pageboys - including Robbie Williams\u0026#39 daughter TheodoraWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000111038848_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"alone not lonely shutting door world keeps sane","story":"The number of Britons travelling on their tod is up by almost a thirdForget separate bedrooms, the secret to happiness is separate living rooms Britons are increasingly going it alone, whether they are alone or not.

State media showed rescuers helping the two crew members into a helicopter, and Nasa said the men were in good condition.“Vehicle malfunction. That was a quick flight,” Mr Ovchinin declared dryly over the radio at the beginning of the emergency descent.Rescuers help the two crew members out of a helicopter in KazakhstanThe crash comes after Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin accused Elon Musk of conspiring with the Pentagon to force other players out of the space industry and suggested that international astronauts had sabotaged the ISS by drilling the hole found in its hull.Adding to the embarrassment was a string of tweets by Roscosmos detailing the successful completion of three launch stages that never actually happened. The agency later deleted tweets with false information such as “287 seconds: The second stage successfully jettisoned”.  After a normal liftoff from the same launchpad from where Yury Gagarin began the first manned space flight, the accident occurred amid the transition from the four large launch boosters to the next set of engines. “Thank God the crew is alive,” Vladimir Putin\u0027s spokesman said. A Nasa statement blamed an “anomaly with the booster” for the incident and promised a thorough investigation.Part of the second stage may have gotten caught on the first due to “poor fastening,” pushing the craft off-course and causing the emergency shutdown of the engines, Interfax news agency quoted a space industry source as saying.   Further Roscosmos launches have been suspended, Mr Borisov said. Another two-man Russian-American crew had been scheduled to set out for the space station on 20 December. An American, a Russian and a German astronaut who had planned to return from the ISS on the Soyuz MS-10 ship will have to reconsider their plans. A plume of smoke trails behind the rocket before its crashBesides the two astronauts, the crashed rocket had been carrying supplies, but the ISS has enough reserves for another six months of operations. Roscosmos tweeted photographs of Mr Rogozin speaking with Mr Hague and Mr Ovchinin while they relaxed on couches with blood pressure and pulse monitors on their arms. After a medical examination they would fly back to Moscow, it said. Russian experts said the astronauts, both former military pilots, had been trained to withstand even more intense g-forces.A rescue team arrives at the capsule after it crash landed in the grasslands of Kazakhstan 250 miles from Baikonur cosmodromeA lengthening list of accidents has raised doubts about the state of Russia\u0027s space programme.   In a gross human error, an unmanned Soyuz rocket launched from Russia\u0027s new Vostochny cosmodrome in November crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after it was programmed with the launch coordinates for Baikonur.The disaster, which came after Mr Rogozin had declared the mission a success, destroyed 19 international satellites worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Russian unmanned cargo rockets of different designs crashed in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Alexei Ovchinin and Nick Hague wave to onlookers before boarding the spacecraftIn 2013, a Proton-M rocket carrying three satellites for the Glonass navigation system, Russia\u0027s rival to GPS, burst into flames and slammed into the crowd on live television. Mr Rogozin, who was sanctioned by the United States and European Union in 2014 over Russia\u0027s intervention in Ukraine crisis, lost his position as deputy prime minister this year but retained much of his influence with the appointment as head of Roscosmos. Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin attends a send-off ceremony before the launchThe ISS, which has been circling the earth at more than 17,000 miles per hour since 1998, is one of the few remaining areas of cooperation between Moscow and Washington amid rising political tensions.Mr Hague was born in 1975, the year the United States and Soviet Union launched their first joint space mission. Tories risk repeat of poll tax backlash over Universal Credit roll out, warns Sir John MajorFaux leather promoted by \u0026#39ethical designers\u0026#39 like Stella McCartney is polluting the oceans with plastic, BBC expert saysComment: Tony Blair just made an incredible offer on Brexit – and you won’t want to miss outCoward or following protocol: What would you have done in Sir Craig Mackey\u0026#39s shoes?Royal wedding guest list: Who have Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank invited?Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding: Time, date, details and latest newsComment: The arranged marriage between Theresa May and the DUP could be heading for orceTransgender prisoner born a male who sexually assaulted female inmates after being jailed for rape is sentenced to life India scrambles to control Zika outbreakComment: It\u0026#39s companies, not just the Government, that should be making the case for capitalismHares are dying mysteriously amid fears myxomatosis has \u0026#39jumped\u0026#39 from rabbits, UEA study saysMuch Ado About Shakespeare episode 11: Behind the Scenes of Troilus and CressidaUK could be forced to hand over to Azerbaijan millions from Harrods \u0026#39big spender\u0026#39 Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s new Rolls-Royce shows North Korean sanctions are \u0026#39a bit of a joke\u0026#39Cambridge University students vote against Remembrance Sunday motion over fears it \u0026#39glorifies\u0026#39 warPrincess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding procession route: Where to watch the newlywedsSkateboarder who attacked London Bridge terrorists to be given posthumous bravery awardRates of severe obesity soaring among children, new figures showMeet Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s bridesmaids and pageboys - including Robbie Williams\u0026#39 daughter TheodoraComment: Ten times Theresa May told us how bad a customs union would be... before doing a U-turnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000177195299_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKIJTrz3Ias06JM6YNEP2rmWyvnsg2_xORUkxdK7-MzM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"kim jong uns new rolls royce shows north korean sanctions bit","story":"A Rolls Royce is visible in the background as Kim Jong-un arrives for a working lunch with Mike PompeoKim Jong-un arrived at his recent meeting with Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, in a new Rolls-Royce Phantom, suggesting that international sanctions are no longer halting the regime’s acquisition of luxury goods. Video images of Mr Kim arriving for the talks in Pyongyang with Mr Pompeo on Sunday show a jet black Rolls Royce with darkened windows and the distinctive entwined capital Rs on its wheel hubs.Mr Kim appears to have traded in the Mercedes-Benz that he has previously used for important occasions, with automotive website the Drive identifying the vehicle as a Phantom. A basic version of the Phantom starts at £318,120, although the website suggested the car would have undergone extensive upgrades to meet the needs of the North Korean dictator, including bulletproofing to enable it to withstand machine gun rounds. The images have triggered speculation as to how Mr Kim was able to procure a Rolls-Royce, given the ban imposed by the United Nations on imports of high-end goods. Specified on an updated list of banned items, released in December 2016, are, “Luxury automobiles (and motor vehicles) automobiles and other motor vehicles to transport people”. “The sanctions regime has become a bit of a joke”, said Robert Dujarric, a professor of international relations at the Japan campus of Temple University. Inside North Korea: fascinating images of the world\u0026#039s most secretive state“Someone from their embassy in London could have walked into a Rolls-Royce showroom, paid in cash and had the car in a container heading for the Far East in a matter of days”, he said. “It’s not a weapon, it’s not got any significant technology attached to it and there would not have been too many eyebrows raised. “Once it gets to Beijing, all they have to do is put diplomatic plates on it and put it in a container to go over the border on a train or truck”, he said. “They could even have driven it over the border because with diplomatic plates, no border guard is going to stop it. “The Chinese authorities are not going to make a fuss over a car, even if they know it is going to Mr Kim himself”, Mr Dujarric told The . “In any case, it is quite clear that the sanctions are beginning to fade and neither China nor Russia are doing the US any favours on that front for their own reasons”, he said.And while US media have suggested that Mr Kim’s ostentatious use of a banned luxury vehicle may have been a calculated “slap in the face” to President Donald Trump’s emissary, Mr Dujarric said there is a clear upside. “This is a car with no military value and I’m sure that Washington would rather Mr Kim is spending his money on cars rather than chemical weapons or nuclear warheads”, he said. Please review our commenting policyTories risk repeat of poll tax backlash over Universal Credit roll out, warns Sir John MajorFaux leather promoted by \u0026#39ethical designers\u0026#39 like Stella McCartney is polluting the oceans with plastic, BBC expert saysComment: Tony Blair just made an incredible offer on Brexit – and you won’t want to miss outCoward or following protocol: What would you have done in Sir Craig Mackey\u0026#39s shoes?Royal wedding guest list: Who have Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank invited?Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding: Time, date, details and latest newsComment: The arranged marriage between Theresa May and the DUP could be heading for orceTransgender prisoner born a male who sexually assaulted female inmates after being jailed for rape is sentenced to life Astronauts make emergency landing after Russian rocket carrying them to International Space Station failsIndia scrambles to control Zika outbreakComment: It\u0026#39s companies, not just the Government, that should be making the case for capitalismHares are dying mysteriously amid fears myxomatosis has \u0026#39jumped\u0026#39 from rabbits, UEA study saysMuch Ado About Shakespeare episode 11: Behind the Scenes of Troilus and CressidaUK could be forced to hand over to Azerbaijan millions from Harrods \u0026#39big spender\u0026#39 Cambridge University students vote against Remembrance Sunday motion over fears it \u0026#39glorifies\u0026#39 warPrincess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding procession route: Where to watch the newlywedsSkateboarder who attacked London Bridge terrorists to be given posthumous bravery awardRates of severe obesity soaring among children, new figures showMeet Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s bridesmaids and pageboys -

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

The traditional four-day celebratory festival marks one of the holiest days in the Islamic religious calendarIn this view, Labour’s proposal to renationalise railway franchises and water companies would not, as the Conservatives have claimed, cost hundreds of billions of pounds.\u0026nbspThe government would merely create debt on the liability side of the balance sheet while gaining an asset of the corresponding value, resulting in a net cost of zero.\u0026nbspThe asset in turn has the potential to generate future income. For example, privatised water companies paid £6.5bn in idends and interest to shareholders over the last five years, according to data compiled by the GMB\u0026nbspunion.The IMF also warned on Tuesday that Brexit is among the primary risks to global economic stability.The Washington-based organisation urged financial institutions to “step up their preparations for a post-Brexit landscape”, including for a no-deal scenario.\u0026nbspIt warned that concerns about a no-deal Brexit appear to have increased, driving volatility in the\u0026nbsppound and suppressing company valuations.\u0026nbspThe IMF pointed to “growing anxiety” that Brexit negotiations could break down, increasing uncertainty in the UK and beyond, potentially triggering a “sharp tightening of global financial conditions”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

There is no introductory rate - 1.5 per cent rate applies at all times that the account is open, as long as the holder deposits at least £50 a month.However, the rate only applies to to the first £10,000, which is some way short of Goldman\u0027s account which pays 1.5 per cent up to £250,000.Another new account from RBS, the Premium Saver, pays 0.85 per cent and is designed for customers with a lump sum ready to invest.\u0026nbspAlan Hardie, head of products at RBS said, “Offering an account which encourages saving but also offers flexibility when people need access to their money, enables our customers to have more control over how they manage their money.”RBS still shooting itself in the foot ten years on from its £45bn baiRBS boss Ross McEwan warns no-deal Brexit could push UK into recessionRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysRBS boss \u0027withheld information about criminal investigation from MPs\u0027RBS to close 54 more branches and cut hundreds of jobsRBS is the first UK bank to announce new accounts since Goldman entered the UK market.

Pre-tax profit dropped 4 per cent to £134m from £140m although trading profit was up 3 per cent to £163m from £158m last year. Group revenue was flat on a like-for-like basis. Stephen Clarke, WH Smith’s chief executive, said the group had a good year on the high street, “despite the well documented challenges of the UK high street”. The second half of the year was particularly encouraging, Mr Clarke, as “the business traded well and we quickly identified the latest trend in the market, becoming a one-stop-shop for all slime related products”.What is slime and is it dangerous?The new craze seeing parents inadvertently burn their childrenWH Smith slammed for selling toothpaste at £8 a tube in hospitalWH Smith shows how to be a high street survivorSlime products have surged in popularity in the last 12 months, becoming a must-have plaything for children, although some consumer groups have warned of safety risks. \u0026nbspDespite the boost to business from slime, WH Smith’s boss said: “We are not ignoring the broader challenges on the UK high street and, during the second half, we conducted a business review to ensure our High Street business is fit for purpose now and for the future.”Earlier this year, WH Smith was voted the worst shop on the high street in a survey carried out by Which?, with shoppers criticising customer service, value for money and the standard of its stores.Shares in the group dropped more than 7 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As well as the two phones – the smaller and bigger version – there was\u0026nbspa new version of the Google Home voice assistant that has a screen, as well as a\u0026nbspnew tablet.Most of the new devices had already been leaked ahead of the official unveiling, but Google still managed a few surprises, especially with its exceptional camera.A full round-up of the event can be found below.As we wait for everything to get started, perhaps it\u0027s worth taking a trip down memory lane to where it all began: the original Pixel. I reviewed it in glowing terms all the way back in 2016, and I think the phone has kept up the promises it showed at that time.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s that original review.With the launch of Indy Minds, we\u0027re offering editors\u0027 letters, which offer a little peek behind the scenes here. And I\u0027ve written today\u0027s, which covers the Google launch as well as our preparations and thoughts. You can take a look at here if you like.Google has lots going on today, not all of it quite as fun or as exciting as the Pixel. For instance, it just disclosed there was a major hack of Google+, and that it\u0027s shutting down.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s why that\u0027s important, even if you don\u0027t consider yourself a Google+ user (which, well, who among us does).We\u0027re starting off with a bit of an unusual video about all of the leaks there have been relating to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. And there have been a lot.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe soundtrack\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsp\u0027Help\u0027 by The Beatles – a hint for things to come perhaps? Google Assistant anyone?Rick Osterloh comes on stage to tell us that 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of Google. It\u0027s fair to say the company has achieved a lot in that time, but Osterloh doesn\u0027t have time to tell us about all of that. He\u0027s here to talk about the Pixel.\u0026nbspMany of you in this room say last year\u0027s Pixel 2 still takes the best photos even after a year with so many amazing phones, he says, before moving on to the AI technology that makes this possible.From out of a pedestal in the middle of the room, appear three devices: The Pixel 3, Pixel Slate and Google Home Hub.\u0026nbspEager reporters are crowding around to get a picture, as Osterloh races through the announcements.\u0026nbspThe Pixel Slate apparently brings the power and productivity of a desktop to a tablet, according to Osterloh. Google definitely isn\u0027t the first to make that claim.\u0026nbspThe Google Home Hub, as you might imagine, is for the home. The smart home in 2018 is too complex, he says. I dunno if a brand new device is the way to make things any clearer.Diya Jolly, Google\u0027s vice president of product management, comes on stage to talk about the smart home, revealing that queries to Google Home has gone up 400 per cent in the past year.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNow imagine not just hearing\u0026nbspa response, but being able to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspa response. That is the power of Google Home Hub, she says, referencing the screen that accompanies the hub, as she refers to it.It\u0027s a bit like the Portal device that Facebook unveiled this week, however there is one key difference.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspconsciously did not put a camera on the Hub so that is comfortable to use in private spaces like the bedroom, she says.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s\u0026nbsplots\u0026nbspof digital wellbeing here. It\u0027s been a major part of every announcement. The Hub, for instance, can be put into a special downtime mode so that it won\u0027t bother you the Slate will start to go to sleep at night time. Like Anthony said about the Hub\u0027s lack of cameras, it\u0027s hard to read Google and Apple\u0027s focus on this stuff as anything but a shot at people like Facebook, even if they aren\u0027t doing it consciously.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I was employed\u0026nbspas Tim Rice’s assistant. Abba had just disbanded and my first job was to go to meet Björn from the airport. I’d always loved the Abba songs but that was when I fell in love with them. Meeting Benny and Björn\u0026nbspand working with them over the next five years, I became extremely interested in those songs, which I think they thought they had left behind, as they were working on other musical projects.When I was younger, I was an Abba fan but I was more into Bowie, and I went through the rock phase of the\u0026nbspLed Zeppelins and the Emerson, Lake and Palmers. I loved “Dancing Queen”\u0026nbspbut I never went to an Abba concert.Mamma Mia 2 star Cher takes a chance on selling her Beverly Hills homeWhy ‘Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again’ is our antidote to BrexitLily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2Yet\u0026nbspI was compelled by the songs and by meeting the guys. The song “The Winner Takes it All” was the inspiration for Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspand when I met Björn I wanted to know what must have been going round in his head when he wrote that song.It’s a huge romancebreakup song\u0026nbspa woman having a conversation in her head with a man who has hurt her and let her down or maybe cheated on her. “Tell me does she kiss,\u0026nbsplike\u0026nbspI used to kiss you?” The lyrics are full of hurt it’s a roller coaster of emotions. But how do you make a musical out of a song that is taking you towards Greek tragedy? That’s what I love about Abba songs. They take you on this journey, and even if they hit a certain emotional spot, you’re still left feeling in a good mood.I felt the idea of hearing somebody sing that song in the theatre was like “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina”\u0026nbspit was “the 11 o’clock number “ as they say on Broadway –\u0026nbspthe second act showstopper.Benny and Björn were against anything that would be a tribute or a biographical story but that\u0026nbspdidn’t interest me either. Björn was interested at first more than Benny because the musical was to use\u0026nbsphis lyrics as the source material. Those amazing words took us through the stage show and now two films.It was funny working on the second film because people would say:\u0026nbsp“Are there enough songs?”\u0026nbspI certainly thought there were, and, in fact, I think there’s a whole new audience that didn’t know Abba, didn’t grow up with Abba, didn’t know them as a band and yet\u0026nbspknow those songs as Mamma Mia! That tickles Benny and Björn quite a lot.The girls haven’t been so involved because Benny and Björn wrote the songs. But Frida has always been very supportive. And Agnetha too for that matter.Of course, I was passionate and keen about the show, but I had to work hard to convince people that it wasn’t just a\u0026nbspperformance in which\u0026nbsppeople were going to be dressing up as Frida and Agnetha, and Benny and Björn.I knew those songs worked for two generations. For the younger audience members there was “Honey Honey” and “Dancing Queen”, the dancing songs. And then there’s the\u0026nbspmore emotional breakup songs, perhaps for older fans. I toyed with different ideas\u0026nbspthen in the mid-Nineties, Björn\u0026nbsptold me that\u0026nbspif I could\u0026nbspfind the right story\u0026nbsphe and Benny\u0026nbspmight be interested.That’s when I met playwright Catherine Johnson and pitched all my thoughts to her about generations, and how the theme of the production\u0026nbsphad to be weddings or holidays. I felt it had to be something nostalgic that took you to a happy place and Catherine\u0026nbspcame up with the genius mother-daughter idea\u0026nbspset around a wedding, and examining the relationship between a\u0026nbspmother and a daughter\u0026nbsp– and\u0026nbspthree possible fathers. And that immediately appealed to Björn and Benny.I hadn’t thought at that stage of the possibility of it becoming a film – I thought it might make a small TV film. But I always had a pull towards a stage show. And now I’ve overseen\u0026nbsp50 productions.The stakes were high because Mamma Mia! had done 20 years in London\u0026nbspand the first movie had been one of the most successful musical films ever.I had seen Love Actually. I adored Richard Curtis’s work. If we were to do another film we had to explore different emotions, and he is so brilliant not just at romance but also taking risks on life and loss: at the heart of all his comedies is\u0026nbsploss. He thought about this in the sense of going back and forth and to different places,\u0026nbspand all he had to say to me was “The Godfather: Part II” and I completely got it.You have to have ‘Dancing Queen’. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?Even the music is like The Godfather: Part II\u0026nbsprich sweeping ballads. It underscores. There’s a rich palate of Abba in there.It was always the intention to reuse songs from the first film. You have to have “Dancing Queen”. Why would you go to see your favourite band if they’re not going to play your favourite songs?There were songs that I knew still had the power of storytelling and also the power of comedy,\u0026nbspsomething fun that has come from the stage show,\u0026nbspwhether it’s “Chiquitita” or “Take a Chance”.\u0026nbspBrosnan (PA)Curtis said he loved Mamma Mia! and\u0026nbspAbba\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand though he didn’t have time to write the screenplay\u0026nbsphimself, he\u0026nbspwas happy to support our endeavours, especially if there was a writer he liked and wanted to work with. That person was Ol Parker, who came on board as a writer at that time (and then later became the director).So, it was a matter of making the story work.\u0026nbspMeryl Streep\u0026nbsphad always been affectionate towards the original\u0026nbspMamma Mia! and was keen on being in a possible\u0026nbspsequel but I knew she was never\u0026nbspgoing to take on a role as big as the first one. And for her to be part of it, what song? You can’t really top “The Winner Takes it All” from the first film, and she wasn’t going to be running along rooftops and jumping off cliffs singing lots of Abba songs. “My Love, My Life” is an incredibly affecting song and I think equal to “The Winner Takes it All”.Created with Sketch.ABBA: Eurovision victory in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport Abba performs their song Waterloo during the Eurovision Song ContestAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA give the thumbs up after winning the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027ABBA posing at Waterloo railway station.Anna and Frida singing Sweden\u0027s entry, Waterloo, during a dress rehearsal in BrightonAbba meet a mounted policeman as they relax in Brighton, after their victory in the Eurovision Song ContestABBA in BrightonAbba congratulate each other in Brighton, after winning the Eurovision Song ContestABBA during a photocall in London to promote their song \u0027Waterloo\u0027 before the Eurovision song contestBenny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus posing at Waterloo railway stationAbba strolling hand in hand amongst the daffodils in Hyde ParkAbba after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in BrightonAbba arriving at London Airport I’m going to claim Cher as my idea, though Ol would probably also claim it as his.\u0026nbspI’ve always loved Cher\u0026nbspand had a conversation with her for the last movie before we cast Christine Baranski to see whether Cher would be interested in playing\u0026nbspTania then. She wasn’t, but she said to me recently it worked out well this way round.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspalso felt that\u0026nbspif we were going to do a second film, well\u0026nbspwe had hit a high with Meryl on the first\u0026nbspand now we’d\u0026nbspgot to hit it out of the park. Who is one of the greatest actors who can sing? There’s Cher, there’s Bette\u0026nbspMidler and there’s Barbra Streisand. There was always going to be a mother character. Ol wrote the part\u0026nbspas the ultimate rock chick, and with Cher in mind. I was always fixated that Cher would be the perfect casting.Mamma Mia! has traditionally had great female roles that we lack in musical theatre and in movies and Cher really embraced it.\u0026nbspFor both films\u0026nbspwe cast brilliant actors. And\u0026nbspnow we\u0026nbsphave three generations, with Cher and Meryl Christine\u0026nbspBaranski\u0026nbspand Julie Walters\u0026nbspand Amanda Seyfried and the Lily James generation – and Cher gets the guy.“Fernando” was a favourite Abba song of hers and it was tempting for her to sing it.\u0026nbspI think with this film we could have a wink at the audience with how we use this old song, and it’s a brilliant moment when she and Andy Garcia (Fernando) discover each other again\u0026nbspand she tells that story through the power of her voice. You feel she was probably rebelling as a young woman in her early 20s, and then probably again when she was Donna Sheridan’s mum\u0026nbsphanging out at Studio 54 too much. And now we see her come back in her full glory as Ruby Sheridan – or as Cher, in fact.Saudi woman barred from marrying man ‘because he plays a instrument’Lily James on playing a young Meryl Streep, and singing Abba for AbbaAll the ABBA songs featured in Mamma Mia 2It was said that the last film\u0026nbspinvigorated people\u0026nbspand I think it probably did. We ran all summer, the summer of the financial crash, and it brought people of every age to the cinema. As a show we opened at the most tragic of all times in New York, the time of 911. You’ve got this massive show and one of the worst tragedies that you can imagine. How do you deal with that? With everyone involved\u0026nbspand the city in complete crisis, while people have\u0026nbspto keep going and\u0026nbspearn a living?It was a difficult time but the then-mayor, Rudy Giuliani, was incredibly galvanising to the Broadway community. People asked us:\u0026nbsp“Are you still going to open?” The answer had to be “yes”.\u0026nbspEveryone thought about it a lot and I know Phyllida sat and talked to the cast when we were rehearsing, it was almost like a therapy. But it was the best thing for everyone to make the show happen.I don’t think there will be a “Mamma Mia 3!”. It’s great that people are thinking that way I think people feel very safe with Mamma Mia! and this new movie has a lot more emotional heft, and it really makes you laugh and cry:\u0026nbspit’s a shared experience. And those songs, of course. They said, back when the show opened: “Oh people don’t always know those Abba songs.”\u0026nbspBut now “When I Kissed the Teacher”\u0026nbsp– the opening song on the movie – has\u0026nbspbeen\u0026nbsptrending on Spotify.Mamma Mia! was way before social media in the case of the stage show even the first\u0026nbspmovie came out before social media was the force it is now.

I’d been charged with “gutting” an official report into a business deal – the buyer was thought to have covered up the source\u0026nbspof his money. It was a big story at the time. I was called to the editor’s office\u0026nbspand told, to my shock, that I was not only going to cover the findings, but I was writing that week’s leader.Just at that point, as the news sank in, the editor suddenly rose. Behind me, a familiar figure had walked, unannounced, into the room. It was Murdoch, the proprietor. He gestured to sit down, and asked what we were discussing.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyThe editor told him, and explained that it was going to be the subject of an editorial\u0026nbspand that I was putting it together. Whereupon Murdoch turned to me, fixed me with a stare, and asked: “Why does it matter?”I stammered some sort of reply about the importance of knowing where people’s funding originated – this was well before money laundering became a hot topic. Murdoch wrinkled his face. I was on shaky ground, clearly he did not think it of any importance at all. Then, another man who was standing in the doorway, who was accompanying him, spoke. He reminded Murdoch that they’d done a deal with the subject of the official inquiry, which had gone sour. Murdoch listened, and nodded. “That’s right, I remember.” He looked at me. “Son, write it as hard as you like.”Down the years, the memory of that short encounter has stuck. Murdoch was not physically large, but he conveyed immense power. His energy was obvious. He was naturally combative, constantly seeking to challenge.Back then, the basement under The Sunday Times building in\u0026nbspWapping was a store room. It was full of satellite dishes. Sky TV was in its infancy, and it relied on the newfangled device of a dish rather than the traditional aerial. If I’m honest, I doubt if many of us gave the fledgling venture much of a chance. Terrestrial broadcasting, led by the BBC, was so entrenched in the UK, that the prospect of it being seriously taken on seemed fanciful. Not only that, Sky would have to rely on a pay-per-view model, while the BBC was funded by the government, and by what was effectively a tax in the form of the annual licence fee.The amount the Murdoch family is said to have made from selling their 39 per cent stake in Sky to ComcastSome 30 years later, Murdoch has sold his remaining 39 per cent stake in Sky to the US company Comcast, in a deal that valued the UK firm at £30bn, and which netted the founder and his family £12bn.The company statement which accompanied the deal showed I was not alone in my scepticism. “When we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,” it said. “We bet – and almost lost –\u0026nbspthe farm on launching a business that many didn’t think was such a good idea. Today, Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company and a world-class example of a customer-driven enterprise.”While that hints at the risk Murdoch took –\u0026nbspand gives some indication of his resulting emotional attachment to the company, and pride in his achievement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit does not say what Sky also did: transforming English football rivalling the mighty BBC for news coverage with Sky News and taking on broadband providers by offering internet services. And as it says, the company spread across Europe, in Italy and Germany. In the process, Sky also grew to become a central component in the Murdoch global empire.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyComcast beats Rupert Murdoch’s Fox in Sky takeover battleMPs vow to defy ‘threatening’ newspaper headlines on Brexit voteTony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Now, it’s gone. Not only that, Murdoch has previously sold much of 21st Century Fox’s film and TV production assets to Disney in a $70bn (£54bn) deal, leaving him and his family with the Fox sports and news channels, and the News Corp newspaper and publishing businesses in the UK, US and Australia.That’s still a massive undertaking, and one that would keep most people fully engaged. But Murdoch is not most people. Even at 87 years of age he exhibits the ambition and drive of someone much younger.There have been signs in recent years of Murdoch slowing down. But it would be wrong to suppose these latest developments\u0026nbspwill see him signal the end. When he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on phone hacking by his newspapers in 2012\u0026nbspthe slowness of his answers, containing numerous pauses, shocked many.Not those who know Murdoch. He’s always spoken like this, particularly in a situation where he is being confronted and put on the spot. His tactic is to buy time, to speak after a considered silence, to be drawn out, and careful.He is extremely happily ensconced\u0026nbspwith his new wife, Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior. At a recent party, attended by media and arts folk, their arrival drew the usual sarcastic whispers, along the lines of what does the tall, former supermodel see in the much older billionaire. My wife, who was observing, said it was obvious – they were very much in love, you only had to look at their body language, and their attentiveness towards each other, to realise that.She had a point: they did indeed appear infatuated, moving away from the crowd to sit,\u0026nbspchat and laugh together.These days, Murdoch is more likely to be found in suburban Richmond, in southwest London, where Jerry has long maintained a glorious home, than in one of the world’s business centres. Early mornings often find him taking a constitutional walk in nearby Richmond Park. But that does not mean the friendly old cove – several journalists have declared their astonishment at seeing the feared media titan strolling along, smiling and relaxed – is not pondering as he goes.It’s too easy to suppose the phrase “clogs to clogs in three generations” applies to Rupert and his offspring. On the face of it that might appear so – he spends three decades building up Sky, longer where his newspapers are concerned\u0026nbsphis progeny are not up to the task of grabbing the steering wheel and pushing the businesses on to even greater heights.It’s true that they might lack their father’s hunger and clarity of vision. It’s impossible for instance to imagine James, Lachlan or Elisabeth (Prudence, their elder half-sister, is not so business-oriented) having the courage to buy a fading paper like The Sun, and to turn it into the self-styled “People’s Paper”, challenging the orthodoxy every inch of the way. Or being prepared to tilt at BBC News. Or\u0026nbspdisrupting the established order by forcing up the price of live sports rights.Neither, though, are any of the three exactly business schmucks. Each has proved themselves to be successful, capable of guiding and leading. They are however very different characters, with specific interests and qualities. Broadly, James is into distribution and technology, Lachlan loves news, Elisabeth is adept at developing new TV content. Ideally, possibly, Murdoch might have hoped for one of them to emerge as a Rupert Mk2, but that has not materialised.According to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, he was desperate for his children to take over –\u0026nbsp“taking pride of place even over profits.”It was not to be.The fact is that with the sales, Murdoch has seen the threat posed by the digital juggernauts, realised he was embedded predominantly in legacy media, as it’s somewhat disparagingly referred to by the onliners, decided it was going to be tough\u0026nbsp(and get even tougher)\u0026nbspto compete – so stayed in the game, but readied to sell up if the price was right.Murdoch’s passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is in newsThat moment has been reached, but while it must rankle that his interests have shrunk, he can take satisfaction from the realisation that the price paid is far higher than anyone foresaw. He may be emotionally attached, but price will always win out. Indeed, he can allow himself a wry smile that Comcast may turn out to have overpaid.Meanwhile, the pressure of combatting the tech behemoths is off, and all he has to do is count his winnings. Murdoch’s situation is akin to that of a poker player getting out while on top. Yes, he may have gone on to chalk up yet more brilliant hands, but equally he may not have been dealt any more. Better, surely, to duck out now, and leave the agony of battle, and watch how the cards fall to the other players in future.There were opponents –\u0026nbspJames, in particular, is believed to have been resistant (as he should have been, since it was James’s part of the Murdoch business mass that was being offloaded).In the end, says Wolff:\u0026nbsp“It is Hall who is said to have given voice to the obvious: just sell and be done.”But it’s not as if the Murdochs are quitting completely. Not only do they retain Fox News and their other sports channels and Fox assets\u0026nbsp(now repackaged in New Fox, to be run by Lachlan), but they have some of the world’s leading print titles with their attendant websites, to be going on with. And bags of cash.They’re now able to pick and choose what they want to buy, where they want to go. One assumption is that they will bolster New Fox’s presence in sports by purchasing more live TV rights. Another is that they will seek to get back into content creation by making their own programmes for the Fox TV networks. Already, names like Sony Pictures Entertainment and Lionsgate are being mentioned as possible acquisition targets. Or, New Fox might decide to start from scratch and develop its own version of Netflix.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Lachlan takes the tiller at New Fox, answerable to his father. James is going off to pursue other interests – he is a director of Tesla, and a close friend of Matthew Vaughn, the film producer and director, and the possibility of James and Matthew hooking up in business together has been rumoured.Of course, it won’t be the same, but consider: New Fox alone should generate more than $2bn a year in cash, and that’s without dipping into the proceeds from the sales of Fox’s entertainment and production arms, and Sky. Murdoch and the younger Murdochs, in short, are not leaving the global media stage. Not yet.It may just be that the sell-offs allow Murdoch to return to his first love: newspapers. He was never that much interested in producing entertainment shows and films. His passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is\u0026nbspin news. And that means Fox, but it also means newspapers, where he began, in Australia, all those years ago.In Australia, his newspapers played a pivotal role in the\u0026nbsprecent putsch against the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, criticising his energy policy. In the UK, his company has moved into news and current affairs radio, adding Talk Radio. Meanwhile, his News UK newspapers continue to enjoy prominence and influence, setting the agenda for TV and radio newscasts.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopIn the US, Murdoch finds himself in a curious position. He’s not thought to have much regard for Donald Trump, although he is close to Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner.Trump, though, is a Republican, and a maverick, someone who likes to shake up the established way. In that sense, he is just like the head of the Fox channel –\u0026nbspTrump’s favourite and, in turn, a strident supporter of the president –\u0026nbspand the newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.Murdoch may have little time for Trump. For all his directness, and for all the cheekiness of some of his titles, notably The Sun, Murdoch remains a serious man at heart, reserving his favour for conviction politicians. But even if Trump does not qualify for praise\u0026nbspin Murdoch’s eyes,\u0026nbspthe media chief still remains a hugely vital figure, right at the centre of the daily cut and thrust surrounding the president.There is much, then, for Murdoch to relish. A chapter or two has been brought to a close, but the story of Murdoch and the Murdochs is far from over.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no introductory rate - 1.5 per cent rate applies at all times that the account is open, as long as the holder deposits at least £50 a month.However, the rate only applies to to the first £10,000, which is some way short of Goldman\u0027s account which pays 1.5 per cent up to £250,000.Another new account from RBS, the Premium Saver, pays 0.85 per cent and is designed for customers with a lump sum ready to invest.\u0026nbspAlan Hardie, head of products at RBS said, “Offering an account which encourages saving but also offers flexibility when people need access to their money, enables our customers to have more control over how they manage their money.”RBS still shooting itself in the foot ten years on from its £45bn baiRBS boss Ross McEwan warns no-deal Brexit could push UK into recessionRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysRBS boss \u0027withheld information about criminal investigation from MPs\u0027RBS to close 54 more branches and cut hundreds of jobsRBS is the first UK bank to announce new accounts since Goldman entered the UK market.

British project leaders have their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with

simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The prisons watchdog flagged up the impact of the remote-controlled flying devices at HMP Liverpool. “Common sense suggests the cuts in prison staff numbers had something to do with the rise in the number of deaths but when we looked in detail it wasn\u0027t as simple as that.\u0026nbsp“There was a rise in self-inflicted deaths across the board, including in high security prisons protected from the cuts.”She warned that there had also been a “marked increase” in inmates cutting and scratching themselves, as well as attempted hangings, overdoses and self-strangulation.The report found that murders had almost doubled from four to seven in the year, and that “extreme violence” was spreading from high-security prisons to low-security establishments that only hold inmates deemed no longer to be violent.In one category C resettlement prison, 25-year-old man jailed for drug dealing was stabbed to death over a mobile phone on his way to Friday prayers.\u0026nbspThe report said levels of violence were at an all-time high in an “increasingly volatile and violent environment” worsened by falling prison staff numbers and the rise of psychoactive substances.Ms Moody said the watchdog was also seeing the “completely unexplained deaths of young men who seem to be well and then die unexpectedly”, sometimes without a cause ever being established.“Anecdotal evidence suggests that they are using psychoactive substances,” she added.\u0026nbsp“Often prison officers tell us they had no idea they were using but prisoners say they were using every day and regularly seen under the influence.”Ms Moody said former legal highs like Spice are now “completely out of control” in Britain’s prisons and remain readily available despite government attempts at a crackdown.“Inidual prisons are really struggling to do what they can,” the ombudsman added. “There needs to be a national drugs strategy which deals with supply and demand and provides advice on what works to prisons.”She said inidual institutions were implementing their own testing and procedures, although some do not have money to buy expensive equipment.Some prisoners died of natural causes and the ombudsman warned that not all were being afforded dignity, with some being kept in handcuffs or chained to prison staff until shortly before their deaths.The report found that both health and mental care was lacking in some institutions and Ms Moody said the death that shocked her the most was that of a teenager suffering from undiagnosed meningitis.The 19-year-old, known as Mr K, was referred to the mental health team but underwent no physical checks, and his erratic behaviour was treated as “poor behaviour” rather than a sign of illness.\u0026nbsp“Over the course of the next three weeks Mr K stopped eating, drinking and communicating,” the report said. “His condition deteriorated severely to the extent that he repeatedly soiled himself and ate his own faeces … staff did not refer him to the prison GP for two weeks, and when they did Mr K refused to attend the appointments.”A week before his death, Mr K collapsed in the shower and was taken to hospital in restraints.\u0026nbspHe was placed in an induced coma and died six days later of meningitis, bacterial endocarditis (an infection of the heart) and pneumonia.In 2017-18 the PPO investigated 180 deaths from natural causes, 74 suicides, seven murders, 23 “non-natural deaths” and 71 allegations of staff using unnecessary force.Mark Day, of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “This disturbing report paints a bleak picture of a prison system where people are dying needlessly, and where lessons clearly set out by the Ombudsman are not being learned.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

He said such checks “already exist in many EU member states – such as between mainland Spain and the Canary islands”.The negotiator also said the EU believed regulatory compliance checks for industrial goods could be carried out at the premises of businesses.But Mr Barnier warned that so-called phytosanitary checks on live animals and other agricultural products had to be carried out at the border, and would have to apply to 100 per cent of all imports. Some of these checks already exist, but they are only conducted as spot-checks and applied to just 10 per cent of imports.“EU rules are very clear: such checks must happen at the border because of food safety and animal health reasons,” he told business leaders.EU rules are very clear: such checks must happen at the border because of food safety and animal health reasons“Obviously in the future the island of Ireland will remain and must remain a simple epidemiologic area, obviously.\u0026nbsp“Such checks already exist in the port of Larne and Belfast. However they would have to cover 100 per cent rather than 10 per cent of live animals and animal-derived products, which would involve a significant change in terms of scale.”He added that there would have to be “administrative procedures that do not exist today” but that “the EU proposes to carry out these checks in the least intrusive way possible”.“The UK wants to leave and will leave the single market and customs union. This means that there must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK and checks that do not exist today,” he warned.Business cannot plan for Brexit \u0027because of government secrecy\u0027Government recruits emergency staff to help tackle Brexit \u0027disruption\u0027Brexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysDUP leader Arlene Foster meets EU officials for extensive Brexit talksMr Barnier said such checks could be reduced in scope in the future if the UK and EU signed a veterinary agreement down the line as part of a trade deal.Brussels is currently in an information lockdown for the final stages of talks, with officials tighter-lipped than usual about progress coming towards a solution.\u0026nbspThe British government has indicated that it would accept regulatory checks proposed by Mr Barnier and that it does not see them as a breach of the UK’s sovereignty in the same way as it sees customs checks.\u0026nbspBut the DUP has made clear that it does not see things the same way,\u0026nbspmeaning a deal could be agreed between the government and EU and then voted down by Ms May’s allies in the Commons.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

So far, only new benefit claimants have been put onto the system.But from July 2019, around 2 million people already receiving the old benefits will be moved onto UC, in a managed migration which is not due for completion until 2023.- Who will be affected?Among those being moved to UC will be about 1 million working families and 745,000 people unable to work because of long-term illness or disability.- Will anyone lose out?The Government has provided a pot of money for transitional protection, which ministers say will ensure that no existing claimants suffer a cut to payments in cash terms unless their circumstances have changed.- Will there be a wait for payments?UC is paid in arrears, and the first payment is not made until at least five weeks after a claim is lodged. Claimants can apply for advance payments to avoid hardship while they wait.- Why is UC being introduced?Ministers say that the new system is simpler and easier to understand than the old benefits. They believe it creates incentives for claimants to take on temporary work or increase hours.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey says that when UC is fully rolled out, it will deliver £8 billion of benefits to the UK economy per year.Esther McVey also failed to back the prime minister\u0027s Chequers plan, which is unpopular among Brexiteers.\u0026nbspShe told the BBC: I am completely supportive of the prime minister, as she well knows. What I won\u0027t do for you now is speculate into what is going on.\u0026nbspAsked repeatedly about the plan, she repeated her support of the PM to get the best deal for the UK.Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, has defended universal credit reforms after warnings from\u0026nbspformer Tory PM Sir John Major that it would be as damaging to the government as the\u0026nbsppoll tax was brought in under Margaret Thatcher.\u0026nbspMs McVey told the BBC she knew more about universal credit than Sir John, and insisted it was working much better than the old system for the vast majority.\u0026nbspShe admits some people could be worse off on this benefit but 1,000 people each day since 2010 have gone into work.\u0026nbspAsked to confirm reports that she told cabinet that people could be £2,400 worse off, Ms McVey said she wouldn\u0027t comment on cabinet discussions. Tough decisions have been made, she said.Ministers have been accused of sneaking out plans to sell almost £4 billion of the student loan book.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on the Government to justify the proposal, as she warned that the last student loan book sale led to losses of £900 million.But universities minister Sam Gyimah denied sneaking out the plans, saying the announcement was made in a written ministerial statement, as he defended the move as good for the taxpayer.In a written ministerial statement published on Wednesday, Mr Gyimah announced the Government\u0027s intention to process plans to sell part of the English student loan book.My colleague Ashley Cowburn has been to the regular lobby briefing, where Downing Street sought to downplay the importance of the meeting.\u0026nbspThe PM\u0027s spokesman said: There is no cabinet meeting, there is no cabinet sub-committee meeting.\u0026nbspThere have been a series of meetings in recent weeks where ministers have just received updates on the state of the negotiations - they are a relatively regular thing.Given it\u0027s now a full meeting, I do not have a cast list. The cast list has varied, there have been a number of meetings. There was one on Tuesday too just to provide an update on the negotiations.Andrea Leadsom has announced there will be an opposition day debate on Universal Credit on Wednesday.\u0026nbspThis is clearly becoming\u0026nbspa problem for the government, as Iain Duncan-Smith, the architect of the policy, and ex-PM Sir John Major have both spoken out about it today.Transport secretary Chris Grayling has offered a\u0026nbspcategorical assurance that planes will not be grounded after Brexit.Despite warning from Whitehall in the last few weeks about disruption to passengers in the event of a no-deal, Mr Grayling said critics had got this completely wrong and planes would still take off after Brexit.He said: There is nothing the government has said or done to imply that planes will be grounded or there will be no flights after we leave the EU.I give this House categorical assurance flights are going to continue.The Education Secretary is expected to brand Labour\u0027s plan to impose a common rulebook on all schools as dangerous control freakery.Damian Hinds was also due to call on Jeremy Corbyn to leave our children alone when he speaks at the launch of the Confederation of School Trusts at the British Library in London, on Thursday.At the Labour Party Conference last month, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner announced plans to impose a new rulebook on schools, scrap the free schools programme and end academisation.Mr Hinds was due to say: Labour saw the evidence. They had a choice between what is working for children and what left wing dogma says.They have made their choice. For them, ideology comes before children\u0027s education.He was due to add: Angela Rayner may call it \u0027local democratic control\u0027.I call it not trusting schools. Why do Labour want to put politicians in charge of schools? It\u0027s because they don\u0027t trust headteachers.Ms Rayner accused Mr Hinds of resorting to absurd claims.She said: When ministers have more to say about the opposition\u0027s policies than their own, it is clear that they\u0027ve run out of ideas.The Tories\u0027 figures on education spending and standards have unravelled day by day and these wild distortions of Labour policies are just another chapter in the same book of fiction.Parents, teachers and communities know that it is the Conservatives who have put ideology first and children second by slashing school budgets for the first time in a generation.Sir John Major\u0026nbspsaid the treatment the PM was receiving at the hands of some in her party was worse than he had suffered when he called some in his party bastards.He told the BBC\u0027s Political Thinking podcast: I have great sympathy for her plight and I think the way she is being treated by some of her colleagues is absolutely outrageous.Sir John said he supported Ms May as PM, although he was at odds with some of her approach to Europe.He said: People in parliament who are undermining the prime minister by wandering round saying we are going to have 40-odd signatures for a leadership election tomorrow, saying unless the Prime Minister does this thing or that thing we are going to vote against it, that\u0027s an intolerable way to treat a prime minister who is in the middle of negotiations.Asked about the bastards from his era, he replied: Their behaviour was pretty intolerable, but not nearly as intolerable as the way the present prime minister is being treated.Former prime minister Tony Blair is\u0026nbspdoing a Q\u0026ampA session at Reuters at the moment.\u0026nbspHe claims the EU would make Britain a much more attractive offer if the UK were to hold a second referendum. The former Labour leader restates his call for MPs to vote down Theresa May\u0027s deal, which would result in the PM having to go back to Brussels, an election, or a referendum, he says.\u0026nbspHe says putting the vote to the people is the only thing that could save Ms May\u0027s premiership.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Northern Ireland is still impossible to fix.When asked whether Theresa May still had time to alter her Chequers proposal, Mr Sked claimed the Prime Minister was going to come under \u0026ldquohuge pressure from within her own cabinet.He added: \u0026ldquoThey will say, \u0026lsquolook Chequers really is dead, you can\u0026rsquot go on talking about it as if it is alive\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoThe plan B that everybody seems to be wanting is the Canada-plus free trade agreement.\u0026ldquoShe has been saying quite adamantly recently that it doesn\u0026rsquot work, she doesn\u0026rsquot believe in it.

And if I had still been in office, say in 2008 to 2009 post financial crash and you were noticing real problems within the community around these questions.\u0026ldquoThe irony is about this whole immigration from Europe position is that there are masses of things that Britain could do if it wanted to restrict that immigration.\u0026ldquoThe truth is, successive government\u0026rsquos decided that they didn\u0026rsquot want to.When asked whether Jeremy Corbyn could become Prime Minister, Mr Blair said: \u0026ldquoOf course.Mr Blair also urged Labour MPs to \u0026ldquohold firm against Brexit suggesting voting down Mrs Mays deal in Parliament brings back the hope of forcing another referendum.\u0026ldquoI would advise them to hold firm against Brexit because either of these choices are unpalatable, he said.\u0026ldquoIf there is no way round this dilemma then you are going to come back with a deal that is going to be unpalatable for one of two reasons - either because people will say \u0027what on earth is the point of having Brexit if you are still bound by the rules?\u0027\u0026ldquoOn the other hand, if you come back with what is essentially a Canada-style free-trade agreement that is going to do immense damage because you are going to have to recreate and restructure your relationships.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest will be Brits who could claim more for child benefit, housing benefit, income support, jobseekers allowance or ESA.Those who are already on Universal Credit at the moment are only new claimants and are unlikely to be affected - but those who are claiming benefits on the old system and who will be rolled over soon could get a welcome boost.Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told The Sun Online: Universal Credit is a benefit system designed for the st century, replacing the old out-of-date legacy system.UC will provide more support to the most vulnerable, and helps people claim their right entitlement, helping those who may not be getting the right amount.As people move onto Universal Credit from the old system, there are around £.bn of unclaimed benefits that people will be able to access – benefiting around , people.Dave Finch, Senior Fellow at the Resolution Foundation, said: One of the key remaining advantages of Universal Credit is that by simplying the benefit system it should help families to claim all of what they’re entitled to.This would offer a welcome income boost to over half a million families, but it risks being undermined by problems where – such as the large cuts made to support for working families.The government needs to both highlight the remaining benefits of Universal Credit, and do more to deal with the signicant problems it still faces.Youll have to re-apply for your benefits again, and fill out the relevant paperwork.But after giving the DWP all your information, the new system should automatically pick up whether you are entitled to more benefits.This could include jobseekers allowance, ESA, income support, tax credits, housing benefit or child benefits.Universal Credit will roll all of these into one new monthly payment.Its thought that around , Brits will benefit from it.Roll-out of the Governments flagship welfare reform programme is expected to take place in  job centres.By , it is expected there will be a full roll out across the UK.For information about whether you can claim, visit Citizens Advice.The news will be a boost for some of the millions of people who are set to migrate over to the new system, which aims to roll several benefits into one monthly payment.But the flagship programme has been beset with issues so far, even though only a small number of the population are on it.The system has been plagued with delays and problems, and hundreds of complaints that benefits have been slashed by hundreds of pounds a month.Some were missing out on hundreds due to when their pay date fell.And one family of a boy battling cancer were so poor on Universal Credit they were forced to eat his leftover hospital food.The Sun Online revealed earlier this year the case of a disabled man born with  holes in his heart who has been denied benefits on Universal Credit - and told to get a job.Ministers have insisted that no one will be worse off going on to the new systemtheir situation doesnt change.But they will only be able to access transitional protection payments for a certain amount of time under Universal Credit.The former Tory leader attacked the Governments key welfare reforms today, saying it would lead to deep political trouble.Sir John said he was worried about how fast it was being rolled out and the way thousands were set to be worse off.He told the BBC: I am saying thatyou have people who have that degree of loss, that is not something that the majority of the British population would think of as fair.Andpeople think you have to remove yourself from fairness, then you are in deep political trouble.The poll tax - introduced in the s - proved very unpopular and led to riots and rebellions, and the fall of Margaret Thatchers government.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover it, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Yesterday ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a huge intervention in the debate, calling on ministers to halt the rollout.He said that Universal Credit was forcing more kids into poverty, and demanded they rethink the entire system.Ministers say the new programme will make work pay, and will encourage more Brits into work.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stigmatising obesity undermines people’s health and makes it harder to seek support.”The Federation also called on social media companies to clamp down on weight abuse online after a snapshot poll found many social media users were using discriminatory language on sites.The research showed the impact was far reaching and damaged people’s career prospects and could lead to social isolation.Based on an academic study, the report highlighted the common the use of negative images used by media when reporting on obesity.Looking at online media in  countries, outlets in South Africa, Hong Kong and Italy were found to be the most stigmatising, but authors said all the countries examined showed some bias.The report also highlights words and phrases to avoid for the obese including “fatty”, “chubster”, “flabby”, “supersized” and “mammoth”.It said instead people should use the terms “iniduals with a high BMI” and “people living with obesity”.Ms Ralston added: “This World Obesity Day we’re calling on the media to reshape the narrative around obesity and for social media companies to clamp down on weight abuse online.“Changing the narrative around diseases and conditions can transform public perceptions and improve quality of le and outcomes for patients.“As obesity rates continue to rise, we’re also appealing to the medical education authorities and providers to improve specialist education in medical schools, as people with obesity are often dismissed by their healthcare professional because of their weight without being properly diagnosed.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But No aides played down hopes of any break through, with one telling The Sun: “We’re a way off yet”.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson also issued a fresh attack on the PM to warn that the Government’s “backstop” proposals for Northern Ireland would make the UK “a permanent EU colony”.Labour MPs also dismissed claims that  of them will defy their own party whip top vote for the PM’s deal, saying Mrs May would struggler to even persuade over  of them.Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said: “It’s quite clear that the Prime minister is in a very dficult position because she spent most of the last two years negotiating with her own party and not with the European Union and the prospects of a signicant rebellion among her own MPs is pretty clear. So it’s not surprising that she’s trying to find support where and we’ve made very clear what kind of package we would support and what we won’t.”The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier last night said a Brexit deal is “within reach”, raising hopes of a breakthrough at next Wednesday’s crucial summit and boosting the pound.Amid expectations of a compromise on the Irish border, he hit back at Arlene Foster’s claim the EU’s backstop would devastate Northern Ireland’s economy.But he warned some checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain will increase tenfoldthe UK doesn’t stay in the customs union.Speaking to business leaders in Brussels the Frenchman said there “must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and UK that don’t exist today”.He said all live animals and animal derived food will have to be checked compared to just % now, which was “a signicant change in terms of scale”.Under his backstop plan other goods would be subject to “scanning barcodes on ferries or in transit ports” helped by Max Fac style trusted trader schemes.Mr Barnier said: “There must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK – checks that do not exist today.“We’re still open to the idea of a customs union with the UK which would eliminate an important part of customs checks.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He murdered PC Keith Palmer.And now the thing that beggars belief. At that very moment, the acting commissioner of the politan Police, Craig Mackey, was leaving the scene in a car. He was inches away from Masood.He was only a few feet away when the Islamic terrorist was busy stabbing his colleague, PC Palmer.He watched the stabbing take place. And what did he do  He drove off, sharpish, having locked the windows of his car.He told an inquest into the murder: “I was in shirt-sleeves with no radio. We had no protective equipment.“The way the male came in, he was clearly a threat.“The attacker had one of those looks where,they get you in that look, they would be after you.”So he skedaddled as fast as he could, actually driving right past Masood.It has a Monty Python ring to it.“When danger reared its ugly head, Sir Craig bravely turned and fled . . .”How, I wondered, could he possibly do that  I thought one of the requirements for being a copper was a certain bravery and, you know, a vague interest in apprehending criminals Also, Masood seemed a bit nasty. He had “one of those looks”.No s**t, Sherlock. This is cowardice and, to my mind, a gross dereliction of duty.At the very least, he could have opened the car door to distract the attacker.Nope, not Sir Craig.

That’s what the lefties wanted at the time.They bleated that stop-and-search was racist. Craig was only too happy to oblige. Oh, the irony of it.It’s thought ending stop-and-search contributed to the jamboree of stabbings we have seen in London this year.You wonder how Mackey has lived with himself these last  months. And how he can possibly retain the respect of his less well-remunerated colleagues.But it tells you a lot about the way our police forces are run these days.Their political grandstanding on “hate-speech” issues.Their reluctance to engage in the dficult, nasty side of policing, such as stopping real villains going about their work.Resign, Sir Craig.At least salvage a little bit of dignity by doing that.She turns them all down because they were too small.

There were no scans at that time and my midwe kept saying that she could feel too many limbs - but we did not expect twins,” she said.Her daughters were born on  December , first Uliyana, then a second girl.“I saw my second daughter just twice in the maternity hospital,” she said.The second twin was rushed to a children’s hospital for treatment because she was “too weak”.“I was discharged from hospital with my first baby,” said Galina.“We were not allowed to visit our second baby in the hospital because of a flu epidemic.”A month later the family were told they could collect their second baby.Vladimir said: “I went to the hospital and the baby was handed over to me through a window.“She was wrapped in a blanket.“The nurse opened her face and asked me – ‘is this your baby ’“Well,it was given to me, it means it was mine. I did not have any single thought that I picked up someone ’s baby.”When they undressed the baby, they were shocked.She had bruises, nappy rash and bedsores.Vladimir said that in Soviet times they couldn’t complain.“People would have thought that we did not want to keep the baby. So we never got back to that hospital and cured our baby ourselves.”The “twins” grew up very dferently.Uliyana was tall, blonde and blue eyed.Yana - now a mother of one who lives with Galina - looked like “a little gypsy girl – with dark and adorable big black eyes”.Galina said: “Their characters were totally dferent.“Uliyana was a quiet home girl.“She loved dolls, and played the violin.“Yana was like a little boy – she ran outside, playing with toy cars.”They persuaded themselves that one girl looked more like her mother, the other like her father.“To be honest, from time to time I was anxious about it but I never told anybody,” said Galina.“I did not even allow myself to think that Yana could be someone ’s daughter”.Galina admitted that the truth has been devastating for Yana.Her real mother recently had a double stroke and cannot walk or speak now.“She was so upset,” said the mother who raised her.“We are trying to support her, to spend more time with her.“She is our child she will remain our daughter forever.”Yana said: “My parents held back this truth for a while.“They were not brave enough to disclose it to me, that Uliyana’s real sister has been found.“On the one hand, I was very happy for my sister, but on the other hand I felt so lonely.“We are all friends now.“We often meet and communicate but still I am often very sad.“I have the one and only mother – Galina.“I went to meet my biological brother Dmitry but we did not get on well.”It is believed she has not met her blood mother who is too ill.“I still cannot accept this for now,” said Yana.It turned out that Yana - born a day after the twins - was also sent to hospital after birth due to low weight.She and Ksenia were treated together - without their mothers being allowed to visit because of the flu epidemic.Ksenia told of her miserable home le - a fate that should have been Yana’s.“I lived with my mother just for four years,” she said.“I had a brother.“Then our mother was deprived of her parental rights and I was sent to an orphanage with my brother.“This is where I grew up.“Our mother visited us couple of times - but she was not really interested.“She drank a lot, then she was ill, now she can’t walk, she had a stroke.“Because of doctors’ negligence I grew up in the orphanage.“I did not have a mother, father and sisters.“I dreamed about a family so many times.“I had to survive in the orphanage and it affected my character.”She was not chosen for adoption, she said.The brother raised with her Dmitry - who now cares for their mother - said:  “I remember how they took me and Ksenia away to the orphanage.“We often protected each other there. I think of Ksenia as my real sister”.Now Ksenia is a mother of three, with sons  and , and a daughter, two.Galina said: “We are so worried about Ksenia.“Her childhood was taken away from her.“She did not have parental love, toys and sweets.“We lost the chance to care for her, to give her education.“Who is guilty  We want justice.”This week a Russian court has awarded compensation of £, each to Uliyana, Yana and parents Vladimir and Galina.Ksenia was awarded £,.The baby swap victims had asked for ten times as much and their lawyer Igor Savvin said they are deciding whether to appeal.The case is the latest in a spate of tragic swapped baby stories from the Soviet era that have only come to light with the use of DNA testing years later.Meanwhile a lawyer for the hospital hit out at the scale of the compensation ordered by the court.Evgeny Kozminykh said:  “Usually such multi-million rouble lawsuits are filed when a tragedy took place, when a patient died due to the doctor’s mistake or became disabled.“Here, in my opinion, we see a happy event.“People found each other after so many years.As a lawyer I must say that I do not accept this lawsuit.”There was “no evidence” that the hospital was culpable in swapping the babies, he claimed, criticising the court verdict which held medics to blame.He claimed the maternity hospital could be responsible.“It happened  years ago and it is not possible to establish the truth now,” he said.“Medical documents are stored for  years only.“Everything has been destroyed now.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000440894042.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside americas evangelical purity movement girls pledge virginity to fathers","story":"The movement, started in Colorado Springs  years ago by believer Randy Wilson and his we Lisa, has since spread across  states and  countries.During elaborate annual Purity Balls, daughters pledge to remain virgins until they get married.The formal occasion entails the girls dressing up in long white gowns and the fathers wearing smart suits, attending a dinner and dance in scenes that resemble a wedding.At the ceremony, fathers are given a key, representing their daughters chastity, to eventually pass on to their daughter’s future husband.Both father and daughter then sign a purity contract and the daughters are given a purity ring to wear on their wedding ring finger.In Louisiana, -year-old Hannah Lee Powers attended a Purity Ball with her father.The teen told Barcroft TV: The Bible says that sex before marriage is a sin and I believe that.“I’m doing this Purity Ball because it’s like a symbol to tell everybody. That this is what I am doing and you may not accept it.You may think it’s weird but this is what I want to do because I want to take the stand for what believe.I want to make a promise to myself and to God that I will stay pure until I get married.I don’t have to have sex to know that I am loved.The Purity Movement preaches that sex before marriage is a sin and wards teens off the act with stories about sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy outside wedlock.Organiser of Hannahs purity ball Deb Brittan said: “Safe sex is a total and complete myth. There is no such thing as safe sex. The reason I have genital herpes today is because someone told me there was such a thing as safe sex.”Hannahs decision to make a purity vow has honoured her dad Beauchamp.He said: “Its an honour for someone to say that they are going to waitI believe one thing, she will get rewarded for it. So it is going to be hard. It’s going to be tough and she will be judged and laughed at and hopefully she can take the heat.”Founder of the movement Randy Wilson says that the idea behind the Purity Ball isn’t just about abstinence, but to also help fathers and daughters establish strong relationships.But there has been a backlash from people claiming that the idea behind the movement implies that a woman’s value lies in her virginity and any bad le decision relates to their choice to have sex.Deb, however, believes there is power in submission.She said: I became sexually active at a very young age and I still remember being very disappointed after that first experience and thinking, ‘You gotta be kidding me.’“When I stated to drink or do drugs and make other reckless choices after my choice to become sexually active, that was all connected.

The mood, especially in the East, is turning. A backlash against Germanys immigration policy and a pick-up in migrant-related crime. Its very far from being just the neo-Nazis. The populist Alternative for Germany party or AfD has made huge gains off the back of its anti-migrant messaging. It is now the largest opposition party in the parliament with a loud and heckling voice to match. It is hoovering up voters disenchanted with the centrist parties and it is emboldening the extremist fringe.The pot boiled over in August in the city of Chemnitz. A German citizen was fatally stabbed in a fight with two asylum seekers. Straight away the far right rallied, but in the days that followed thousands of concerned citizens came out too - angry that they should feel unsafe on their streets and angry at what they called the lying press for refusing to hear their point of view. \"Im not a Nazi but...\" was a common refrain from people who felt that simply voicing their concerns on migration would see them labelled as such. The mainstream media was accused of backing Mrs Merkel and being on the side of refugees. \"Luegenpresse\"echoed through the streets, a term coined by Hitlers propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Not a huge leap from there to Donald Trumps \"enemy of the people\".The AfD has capitalised on this kind of sentiment, stirring the pot through social media to embellish the migrant threat and playing on the notion of victimhood to further its cause. The gist of it being that the German people are both the victims of an influx of asylum seekers who threaten to destroy the very notion of the homeland and the victims of a mainstream media which seeks to besmirch their good name. Talk of rapes, the threat to German wives and daughters, \"kne migration\", catch on especially in the former East where contact with foreigners under socialism was few and far between. In Chemnitz the AfD held a memorial procession for the German victims of migrant-related crime. The partys leader in Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke, was up front. He was strongly criticised for the company he was keeping, marching alongside the anti-Islam Pegida group with neo-Nazi and skinheads among the crowds.\"With a procession of , people attending you cant fully control whos walking along and who isnt,\" he said.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey\"\" data-targeting-\"\" data-tag\"\" data-component-name\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label\"Advertisement\" id\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance\"\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-jeremy-corbyn-labour_4431758.jpg?20180924091538 ","title":"jeremy corbyn calls for children to be taught about legacy of british empire","story":"Bristol is a city which grew rich off the back of slavery and was the scene of more recent battles for racial equality.During his visit, Mr Corbyn will meet with Paul Stephenson, a civil rights activist who was an integral part of the  Bristol bus boycott which saw a battle to overturn a ban on ethnic minorities working on buses in the city.Mr Corbyn will say the stories of people like Mr Stephenson should be as well known as that of Rosa Parks, who died in ."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/17/09/2048x1152/8619edf6f78b36d7a6487b11d8dd9d0de79ea0e5c8f80a60570352e80fe28c48_4106868.jpg?20170921110618 ","title":"qa the global stock market sell off explained","story":":: But why should that hit markets where Higher US interest rates suck money out of other assets around the world and back into US assets - depriving other economies of capital.That is a particular worry for some Latin American economies, for example,investors demand a higher premium for putting their money there rather than in US assets.In addition, a lot of borrowing in emerging markets is denominated in US dollars.When US interest rates rise, the dollar becomes more attractive to hold, while other currencies fall in value in relation to the greenback.In emerging markets, when the dollar rises, then the cost of servicing and ultimately repaying that debt goes upfor people, businesses and governments who have borrowed in dollars. :: Anything  There are an awful lot of things for investors to be concerned about just now.The biggest thing keeping investors awake at night is the risk of an intensication in the trade war between the US and China.It has exacerbated fears that the rate at which the Chinese economy is growing has slowed down.That is bad news, for example, for the mining companies that sell China the raw materials that power its economy or for German manufacturers who supply Chinese industry with machine tools.Its also terrible for countries like Vietnam that have a very close trading relationship with China.

They have said hosting the event will taint the museum because of the regimes involvement in the war in Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition has been engaged in fighting in Yemen for more than three years. Although it is almost impossible to confirm the numbers some , people are understood to have died there. While a UN group of experts recently reported that war crimes are likely to have been committed by all sides in the conflict.  It comes as controversy surrounds the disappearance of journalist and Riyadh critic Jamal Khashoggi, who was last seen going into the Saudi embassy in Turkey nine days ago. Turkish officials claim that Mr Khashoggi was murdered within its walls. Saudi Arabia denies this. But the museum say they need to host such events to maintain our position as a world class scientic research centre and visitor attraction. Earlier this year the Tory Party held their Black and White fundraising ball there.  While in  the Museum hosted the reception for the Farnborough Intrernational Airshow, a major arms fair that brought many of the worlds biggest arms companies together with repressive regimes from around the world.  Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: The Natural History Museum is a very prestigious venue, and should not be hosting a regime which has been accused of killing journalists and is inflicting a humanitarian catastrophe on the people of Yemen. The Saudi authorities have a contempt for human rights, and events like this will undoubtedly be regarded as an endorsement. Its time for the Museum to take a stand.  Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, Director of the Bahrain Institute for Rights  Democracy said: Hosting the Saudi embassy so soon after the alleged murder of a dissident journalist will taint the museums reputation. Conducting business as usual with the Saudi regime normalises its crimes and emboldens it to continue its policy of repression and abuse. A spokesman for the Museum said: The Natural History Museum was booked by the Saudi embassy over two months ago as a venue for an external event to celebrate Saudi Arabia Day. No Museum staff are attending as guests or speaking at the event. Enabling commercial events to take place outside of public opening hours in our iconic spaces brings the Museum an important source of external funding, which allows us to maintain our position as a world class scientic research centre and visitor attraction. We hold a wide iety of commercial events and it is made clear to any host that doing so is not an endorsement of their product, service or views.

She also refused to deny telling her Cabinet colleagues millions of families would lose pound a month.

She repeatedly refused to deny making the comments, saying: I won’t say what I said in Cabinet. I had a very open conversation with my colleagues there about how we support people. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Ms McVey claimed everyone agrees on the principle of UC - despite Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying it has got to go. She added claimants would get pound.billion of transitional support. But she admitted: Ive said we made tough decisions. Some people will be worse off. Under the old system, , people didnt get pound a month, so they didnt get the money they were owed. Under the old system, the most vulnerable in society werent getting as much money as were now going to give them.  What weve done is look at the whole benefit system - how do we get people into work, , people every day. Those people will be on less benefit by the sheer nature that theyre now in work. Ms McVey also refused to deny reports by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studiesthat .million households will be entitled to pound, less per year. Jeremy Corbyn today called for dramatic changes to UC after warning people in the first stage of the rollout - involving more than million claims - had been forced into debt and their homes put at risk.  Labour launched a review last month with the option of scrapping UC - but a party spokesman confirmed yesterday it will be replaced. Speaking during a visit to Bristol, Labours leader said: Three million families are going to be worse off by about pound per week from Universal Credit. So immediately we will say we will stop this process and we would make sure that nobody is worse off under Universal Credit. This morning Sir John Major warned UC could cause the sort of problems that the Conservative Party ran into with the poll tax. The Poll Tax triggered riots and civil disobedience and toppled Margaret Thatcher in  before it was scrapped. Sir John told the BBC he was not specically predicting riots. But he said the Government should rethink its national roll-out. Writing for the Mirror yesterday, Gordon Brown - the architect of Tax Credits which also launched in scandal, but gave a boost to millions - branded UC cruel and vindictive far beyond austerity.  He added: Theresa May says her mission is to address burning injustice. Well the greatest burning injustice of all time is children going to school ill-clad and hungry. It is the poverty of the innocent – of children far too young to know they are not to blame. But the Government have lit the torch of this burning injustice and they have fanned the flames, with their poundbillion of cuts. MPs today summoned a Department for Work and Pensionsminister to give evidence on the July  rollout - BEFORE changes go before Parliament. The Work and Pensions Committee asked Alok Sharma to give evidence urgently about widespread concerns. Downing Street said pound billion worth of transitional protections was being put into the system to help people being moved over. The Prime Ministers official spokesman would not deny the possibility of putting more money into the system at the Budget on October .  Last years Budget saw pound.billion put in - but critics say it was not enough because it has, since its launch in , been bundled up with billions in austerity-driven benefit cuts. The spokesman said: The PM was clear yesterday that we are listening to concerns, that we are taking a test and learn approach to Universal Credit and improving the system as we roll it out. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom doubled down on defending the benefit, insisting it was a simpler system and we are making sure no-one sees a reduction in their benefits. Labour shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz warned the scheme is causing real hurt to people. But Cabinet minister Ms Leadsom replied: I would encourage her not to believe everything she sees in the press.

Meanwhile, other pupils were able to sit and play freely. The Mirror is not naming the family to protect the child’s identity. When his parents discovered  months ago what had occurred, they asked for an apology and an assurance the action would never be repeated. But no apology was forthcoming and they contacted Social Services and their son’s psychiatrist advised them their claims were a “child protection matter”.  Social services made a complaint to the PSNI and wrote to the child’s psychiatrist stating: “We fear [the child] suffered wilful or neglectful failure to prevent injury and suffering, and confinement defined as physical abuse under Social Services procedure.” His parents made an official complaint citing negligence and breach of duty by the school, the Education Authority and the Department of Education but say they have been left in limbo.An internal Education memo, seen by the Mirror, states on June  the parents’ complaints should be registered with Internal Audit as a “potential whistleblowing case”. The mum said: “Our son was tethered like an animal. He’s a placid boy, all his assessments show that. He is physically fit and active with some challenging behaviour but there’s never been a need to restrain him. “Those chairs are made for children who need to be elevated and angled to the right position, not our son. “We didn’t realise what had been going on until he actually managed to show us himself. Our son is autistic and non-verbal, but until this he’d always been happy, cheerful and easy company. “Quite suddenly his personality changed and for the best part of a year we were going rapidly downhill. He was tortured, demented. I was really concerned that he was going out of his mind. “He was so distressed and agitated, having panic attacks, suffering night terrors and he was acting very strangely, a totally dferent little boy to the one we knew and he couldn’t tell us why.  “He started staying in the chair at the dinner table and got very distressedwe tried to get him out of it. His psychiatrist has since told us she believes he’d been conditioned to sitting in a chair. “We’d no idea he was restrained in a chair in school and we hadn’t given our permission for that. But we were told by other parents they’d seen our son being wheeled in the chair but when we asked the school, they denied it.”His dad added: “We took our son out of school and I home schooled him and for weeks he was still distressed but he started to heal. “His smile came back, his anxiety lted, his distress lessened and he was able to go back to school with dferent teachers who have been brilliant. “We are battling for his dignity and his rights that we believe were violated by the very people who should have protected them.”  Human rights lawyer Kevin Winters has agreed to take on the case. He said: “This child has suffered emotionally and the concern is that that emotional suffering will have impacted on his education and to that end, his human rights are engaged.” A National Association of Head Teachers spokesperson, representing the school’s prinicpal, said: “There is an ongoing investigation into these allegations. Our member is complying fully with the investigation.” An Education Authority spokesman said in order to protect the confidentiality of the child, it cannot comment. The Department of Education and the PSNI were also contacted for comment.

The business that sells and distributes Cadbury products in Britain paid no corporation tax here last year even though its profits rocketed by more than % to poundmillion. Mondelez UK Ltd – the biggest British offshoot of the US owner of chocolate giant Cadbury – managed to offset its profits to help wipe out the potential poundmillion tax bill. And while the public purse missed out, the company channelled a idend of nearly poundmillion offshore to its immediate parent company, headquartered in low-tax Switzerland. Mondelez UK Ltd is one of a network of  British subsidiary companies of the US parent. An investigation by the Mirror can reveal these offshoots paid pound.million combined in corporation tax last year on profits of pound.billion.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “This is outrageous. Time and time again we’ve warned the Government this type of behaviour is unacceptable. “We have told them they urgently need to tighten the rules on tax avoidance. “This will do nothing but anger people who are going out to work every day, paying their taxes through PAYE. “The Government has to act now to crack down on tax avoidance.” Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, called what Mondelez was doing “a piece of financial engineering that is very sad given Cadbury’s long history of working to generate value in the communities where they work”.  He added: “Mondelez are stripping value out, by siphoning off taxable profits from the UK through large intra-group idend payments. It is a problem with international tax rules.” He called on Chancellor Philip Hammond to use this month’s Budget to enact powers which the Treasury already has to force multinationals to produce country by country accounts. These would show the total profit made for all their companies in each market and the tax paid. Our revelations will compound criticism of Chicago-based Mondelez International, which when it was known as Kraft, was controversially allowed to buy Cadbury for pound.billion in .  In , shortly before it was bought by Kraft, Cadbury paid poundmillion in corporation tax. Things changed after Kraft won control of the business. Around  jobs were lost when Kraft axed Cadbury’s Somerdale factory in Keynsham, near Bristol. Production was moved to Poland instead. Then it axed hundreds of jobs at Bournville in Birmingham. Mondelez has also been criticised for decisions such as reducing the size of tubs of Heroes, and dumping the Fairtrade cocoa certication in favour of its own scheme.  Accounts for Mondelez UK, which sells other brands as well as Cadbury products, show its turnover rose from pound.billion to pound.billion. Its profits leapt from poundmillion to nearly poundmillion. The surge was mainly due to poundmillion of idends from two subsidiaries, coming from a coffee business in the Netherlands and the sale of its Terry’s chocolate business. This cash offset its profits and helped cut the corporation tax – which is payable on profits – to zero. The practice is not uncommon, but experts say the tax would usually have been paid by the two subsidiaries. Yet accounts for the two showed one paid no tax and the other just pound,. The accounts for Mondelez UK even showed a tax credit of pound,.  A spokesman insisted: “This is an accounting item and is not a tax or cash credit.” Mondelez added: “In common with all global businesses, we pay corporation tax based on the laws of the countries in which we operate. “We comply with all applicable tax legislation in the UK, as directed by HMRC and the Government. We [pay] tax in more than  countries, and on a global basis pay hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate income tax annually. We are a signicant contributor to the UK economy, through direct spending on employees and suppliers, and the recirculation of that expenditure in the economy. “We are investing in our business here and since  are proud to have invested over poundmillion in UK-based manufacturing and RD supporting our , employees in the UK.” Mondelez International also owns Kenco, Bassett’s and Oreo.Campaign group Tax Justice UK is demanding changes, such as raising corporation tax from % to %, to rake in over poundbillion for the NHS.We must nail the myth that we are all avoiders nowCOMMENT By Paul Monaghan Of the Fair Tax Mark Another day, another set of impenetrable figures. This time it’s Mondelez UK and connected company Cadbury UK, which has just reported a seventh year of zero corporation tax payments. These tax avoidance stories create an impression that everyone is “at it”. A myth has been spun telling us thatwe buy duty-free, invest in an ISA or top up our pension we are tax avoiders – so should back off criticising the likes of Amazon and Facebook. Wrong. No tax is being avoided as no tax is due. Those who say we should feel guilty are likely seeking to de-stigmatise the immorality of tax avoidance. In recent years, HMRC has begun to clamp down on avoidance – which it describes as “bending the rules to gain an advantage Parliament never intended” – and evasion, which is illegal. It is estimated the cost to the UK is poundbillion a year – , nurses. Campaigners want multinationals to be forced by governments to produce country-by-country reports of income, profit and taxes. Thankfully a growing movement of firms here – Lush, Timpson, SSE, and the Co-op included – are backing the Fair Tax Mark. In  a group of MPs forced an amendment to a bill requiring large corporations to report country-by-country. It’s time to enact those powers and for the UK to take the lead on tax transparency. From slums to global success Cadbury dates to , when Quaker John Cadbury opened a grocer’s shop in Bull Street, Birmingham. Among other things it sold cocoa and drinking chocolate – seen as an alternative to alcohol, which Quakers deemed bad for society. The firm began manufacturing in , and by  it was selling  types of drinking chocolate. The business passed to sons Richard and George who, at the end of the s, moved the chocolate factory out of the Birmingham slums and into what became the leafy suburb of Bournville.  They added a village green and cricket pavilion. Cadbury milk chocolate bars followed in , then Bournvillle dark chocolate in , then a host of others. In  came the company’s Glass And A Half symbol for Dairy Milk. Cadbury merged with Schweppes in , but split in . In , Cadbury was bought by Kraft, despite opposition. Kraft boss Irene Rosenfeld, who masterminded the deal, pocketed a poundmillion pay and perks deal the previous year. Takeover action leaves bad taste The anger sparked by the sale of Cadbury to US-based giant Kraft prompted an investigation in Parliament. And when Kraft broke a promise to keep open the Cadbury factory near Bristol the deal was only just sealed. In , it was slammed for scrapping an annual Christmas gt box to retired staff to cut costs and for shaving g off each Dairy Milk bar but nothing off the price. In , Kraft ended a Christmas tradition by stopping making its iconic chocolate coins. It triggered furore in  by changing the recipe for its best-selling Cadbury Creme Egg. The shell of Cadbury Dairy Milk was dropped in favour of what critics complained was an inferior version. Earlier this year Cadbury chocolate bars were banned from NHS buildings in a row over prices. The firm which supplies hundreds of hospitals refused to stock brands such as Dairy Milk, Wispa and Crunchie.

Last week another luxury house on a plot of land that Beatles star John Lennon bought for his beloved Aunt Mimi, went up for sale for pound.m. Other properties to have changed hands in recent times include a mock-Tudor mansion that was sold by soccer boss Harry Redknapp to the boss of Topps Tiles.  It sold for pound.m in  but is now said to be valued at poundm after undergoing renovation. And a his and her mansion that has been split in to two homes and lived in by a brother and sister are said to be worth pound. each. Sandbanks, also known as Britains version of Miami Beach, remains hugely popular with London-centric buyers. Local property experts believe the uncertainty over the impact Brexit will have on the London property market is tempting rich buyers to look where. Adrian Dunford, of Sandbanks estate agents Tailor Made, said: We now believe this part of Sandbanks is the most expensive stretch of coastline on the planet in terms of price-per-square foot.  The multi-million pound mansions in Miami and Monte Carlo will be on much bigger plots of land than you get on Sandbanks. The thing about Sandbanks is that it is a peninsula and so we are hemmed in. You cant increase the number of properties and so supply and demand dictate the prices. That row of properties is located in the most enviable part of Sandbanks. The houses have direct water access and also overlook the busiest part of the harbour. The south westerly aspect allows for sensational views to Old Harry Rocks, Poole Harbour, Brownsea Island and the Purbeck Hills. Sometimes with the bigger, headline-priced properties you need two summers to sell them.  So to have two at the very top end of the market go as quickly as they have says an awful lot about the state of the local market. The properties were bought by London-based buyers and that maybe a reflection of what is happening with the Brexit. And Keith Fensom, from Savills, said: Generally the market is dficult because of the uncertainty of Brexit, but that doesnt seem to affect buyers at the super-prime level. Sometimes these houses might come on the market once in a generation and buyers knowthey dont seize their chance they could be waiting years. Some are passed through family trusts and will never come on the market because there are too many beneficiaries to get to agree to sell.  I think the appeal of that section of Sandbanks is that its very private. Houses on the beach dont have quite so much privacy because the beach is open to the public, but on the harbour side you dont have anybody in front of you and you can see all the activity in the harbour and you dont get the queue for the ferry outside your house. There is also a huge dference in value on the road. The opposite side is apartments and townhouses without the view. There arent many roads in the country you can have houses worth poundm on one side of the road and just pound, on the other. I dont think there is anywhere  in the country that compares, I would think its the most expensive coastal road in the country by a long way. The key is, unlike Devon and Cornwall, its close enough to London for people to come for a long weekend. In two hours they can have a complete change in lestyle, thats the attraction.

The bugs, known as Harlequin Ladybirds, are said to be seeking cosy hibernation spots - targeting homes across the country as many of us turn our heating on in time for autumn. Flying in from Asia and North America, the tiny insects have black instead of red wings and are spreading rapidly across England and Wales. British heptathlete and GB Olympian Kelly Sotherton tweeted a horrying video of hundreds of ladybirds crawling around her window and across the ceiling. She said: Get home and welcomed by swarms of ladybirds in every window #ladybirdinvasion.  Twitter user DoubleIn compared the scene to that of a Biblical plague. Many people have been turning to social media to show the extent of the invasion in their area - with some getting plastered in the little bugs while out dog walking. Shakira Phillips was staying in a Premier Inn in East Sussex when she spotted the bugs gathered in the corner of a window.  While Laura Jayne sent theimages of her covered in the ladybirds after taking her dogs for a walk in Bramcote Park, Ilkeston. Lauras trousers were plastered in the little red bugs after she walked through thousands of them in mid-air. She said: I took my dogs for a walk around Bramcote park in Ilkeston and there was a huge ladybird swarm. Must of been thousands flying around in just one area.  Laura Barnes also revealed how the bugs had invaded her home and gathered around her front door and behind furnitire. Kathryn Typer also uploaded an image of the bugs crawling over her walls and ceiling. She said: Losing my s**t here over the little buggers. Jake Outrim also spotted the creepy crawlies scampering across his window. Experts say the foreign invaders actually pose a threat to the domestic species because they carry a sexually-transmitted disease called Laboulbeniales fungal disease. Steve McGrail, director of pest control company Pro Kill Environment, said Harlequin Ladybirds are not harmful to humans but recommended sealing windows to make sure they do not get in homes.  He said: “They are a non-indigenious species. They are coming inside in large numbers. “They usually cluster around window frames and they cluster together to gather heat and hibernate in winter months.” Scientists say a fungus the creatures carry, which is passed on through mating, will infect our native species which are already under threat from habitat loss. While they do not yet knowthe fungus is harmful, the UK Ladybird Survey says it is possible the disease affects the lespan or the number of eggs a female can produce over her lespan.

The material helps the body enter into a thermal comfort zone which may then lead to a more restful sleep, the researchers said.With the body temperature regulated, people can not only fall asleep quicker, but they can also have a longer and better quality kip, a study showed.Researcher Dr Paul Swan, from the University of Sydney, told Sky News : Not so long ago sleeping under wool bedding was the norm, and science is now rediscovering the benefits of sleeping in wool.Maybe it is not a coincidence because wool regulates your body temperature far better, keeping you in what is known as the thermal comfort zone. You therefore not only fall asleep quicker, sleep longer, but also have deeper, better quality sleep.  The researcher identied the importance of getting a good nights sleep on both physical and mental health. The study, in Australia, was carried out using  students and  older participants. Those taking part went to bed in temperatures of around C. Findings, reported in the journal Nature and Science of Sleep, showed that students wearing wool fell asleep four minutes quicker than those dressed in cotton or polyester. And the older participants aged - who were wearing woollen nightwear were even more successful. They managed to sleep up to  minutes quicker.

But over a year on from her daughter’s birth, doctors are still baffled as to what’s causing her to suffer so much. Sinead said: “Everyday can be a struggle, it’s hard. “People often assume I’m anorexic. I’ve had people stare and make comments.  “When I’m walking out with family and we walk through a shopping centre and people stare my mum will say ‘I wish you wore baggier clothes’. “Its almost like she was disgusted at me. Im not ashamed of it though.” Sinead said that her condition has put massive restrictions on what she can and can’t do with social occasions now impossible for her. Since she gave birth to Sienna, her health has gradually declined. A once healthy and active runner and swimmer, Sinead is a shadow of her former self, weighing just four stone and is severely frail. She said: “When I go out for a meal with family and friends I have to go to the loo to be sick. “Its stopped me from doing so many things. “Its embarrassing because I have to explain to people why I have to go the loo so many times during the day. “I used to love swimming and I used to go running all the time. “I have a wheelchair I have to go out sometimes in and I get very tired and breathless easily. “It just comes out in this horrid wave of sickness. Its horrible and uncomfortable.”  Sinead said her weight plummeted after she gave birth but doctors have been unable to diagnose the cause of her condition. She now suffers seizures as a result of potassium loss and has to take medication daily just to stay alive. Sinead said: “I noticed that something was wrong when the sickness from my pregnancy carried on. “I wasnt able to keep any food at all. I could keep it down for an hour but it didn’t even digest. Now I take  tablets each morning and each night. “Its dficult to keep to the routine and to always remind yourself. “Doctor’s tried giving me a feeding tube at one point but I wasn’t able to even keep that down.”  Sinead and her partner Saiman Chung, , are now trying to raise money using gofundme to seek treatment privately. She said that her condition has also dragged her away from spending time with her young daughter - and all she wants is to find a treatment for her condition. Sinead said: “I get quite upset when I have to go to the hospital. I feel like an awful mum because I’m not there for Sienna and I’m making her go through this at such a young age. “It’s heartbreaking. “We dont know how much longer this will go on for and we dont see an end. “Time is running out we want Sinead to be seen quicker. “It would be the whole world.

In September Roisin McWilliams, , was turned down for Personal Independence Paymentwhile fighting for her le against Hodgkins Lymphoma . During her treatment Roisin was exhausted, unable to move or eat and lying on the bathroom floor to be near the toilet, reports Belfast Live .But following a public outcry, Roisin’s PIP payments will be backdated to April following the public outcry. Tom McWilliams said: “Roisin is very happy. It’s a huge weight off her head. “We received a call from our legal team saying that they had been in contact with PIP and they told them the decision had been overturned and the payments would be backdated. We had the confirmation letter on Wednesday.” Tom said the family were “truly overwhelmed” and thankful for the level of support they got from the media, politicians and the public after Belfast Live published Roisin’s story.  “This wasn’t an orange and green issue,” he added.“The politicians came from all walks of le. There were people from Sinn Fein and people from the SDLP , there was people from the DUP , Alliance and the UUP . I am very grateful for that.”But the West Belfast man said his daughter should never been put through such “humiliating and degrading treatment” while fighting Hodgkins Lymphoma. “No one wants to expose the private aspects of their le but we could either accept the decision or fight it,” he added. “I don’t think anyone at that stage should ever have to worry about financial help.” Tom adds that that the decision to reject her PIP claim when she is so sick, also impacted her mental health. “I feel so sorry for the next person that comes behind Roisin,” he added. “It’s just so sad when they don’t have the energy to fight. “The criteria definitely needs to be changed and this needs to be addressed. “I understand those people are following the government policy, but something need to be done. It’s a total disgrace that we put people through this.” A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The department cannot comment on the detail of inidual cases. “In relation to PIP decisions, additional information can become available after the original decision is made. The department will review any sort of additional material which is supplied and is not prescriptive in what this additional information may be. “Some of the most common types of information supplied at this review stage are additional medical records and reports from health professionals which were not available during the original assessment. “The additional information supplied at this stage will be reviewed and depending on its nature may mean the original decision is changed. If the decision is changed, the PIP award will be backdated to the date of application.” Around a quarter of PIP claimants appeal their decision through whats called a mandatory reassessment and many decisions are overturned. As well the good news on her PIP application, Roisin was given the green light for the “very expensive” immunotherapy treatment she needs to have any chance of surviving.  Her dad added: “We received a call from Roisin’s consultant last week to tell us Roisin’s application for funding for her next treatment has been approved. “She started the treatment last week and so far seems to be responding well to it. “It’s a big weight off in light of the way things are going with the government. “The treatment she’s receiving is very aggressive - it knocked her for six. “But shes trying to be very enthusiastic about the whole thing.” After next week the family will find outher brothers are viable donors for Roisin’s stem cell transplant, butnot she will have to turn to the register. Dad Tom is urging everyone who can to register as a stem cell donor online at the Anthony Nolan Trust or DKMS.

The formal occasion, entails the girls wearing long white gowns and the fathers donning smart suits, attending a dinner and dance - making it look like a wedding. Hannah told Barcroft TV: The bible says that sex before marriage is a sin and I believe that.  “I’m doing this Purity Ball because it’s like a symbol to tell everybody. That this is what I am doing and you may not accept it. You may think it’s weird but this is what I want to do because I want to take the stand for what believe in. I want to make a promise to myself and to God that I will stay pure until I get married. I don’t need to do all these things that girls are doing and that girls consider to be normal. I don’t have to do these things. I don’t have to have sex to know that I am loved. For Hannah, both God and her family have heavily influenced her decision to take the purity vow and it especially means a lot to her father. Ahead of the ball, Beauchamp said: “Its an honour for someone to say that they are going to wait, that not just the purity ball dress, but to think that when [she] puts on that wedding dress, that white dress, that white wedding dress, it will also be an outward symbol of, I have held myself, kept myself for my husband. And for her to make that decision publicly, I think its more of an honour than everything . That she has made up her mind. She has made her decision. And I believe one thing, she will get rewarded for it.  So it is going to be hard. It’s going to be tough and she will be judged and laughed at and hopefully she can take the heat.” Founder of the movement Randy Wilson says that the idea behind the Purity Ball isn’t just about abstinence, but to also help fathers and daughters establish strong relationships. But there has been a backlash from people claiming that the idea behind the movement implies that a woman’s value lies in her virginity and any bad le decision relates to their choice to have sex. The organiser of Hannah’s ball is Deb Brittan, whose involvement in the movement came later in le after a volatile orce. She said: I became sexually active at a very young age and I still remember being very disappointed after that first experience. “When I stated to drink or do drugs and make other reckless choices after my choice to become sexually active, that was all connected. Because my devaluing myself and not feeling worthy anymore. And that led me to become a stripper. So I had made one devaluing choice at  to become sexually active. That led to many more devaluing choices.  I immediately ended up in relationship with a young man. It became an obsessive relationship. We ended up getting married. And then it ended up turning into a volatile marriage. It was during that season that I ended up beginning to know my Lord Jesus Christ, to know that there was a God who loved me. I believe that there is power in submission. And so right now these young girls are voluntarily choosing to be obedient to their fathers. In the same way that I choose to submit to my husband’s leadership. Teenager Hannah admits to having boyfriends in the past, but she is now going to extreme s to ensure who she is next dating will become her husband. She said: “My first boyfriend, it lasted about two weeks because he wanted more than I was willing to give. I have my morals and I have my values and I am not going to give that up because of a guy. The smallest thing can lead to temptations to go further and I want to stay as far away from those temptations as I can.  I have set rules for myself, like I promised myself a long time ago that I would not be in a room alone with another guy unless he is family. Because I know that is something that can lead to temptations. I can’t say that I’ve gone all my le without kissing a boy because that would be a lie. Everybody strays from God’s path, butyou’re really willing to turn your le around then God will always forgive you. The Purity Movement preaches that sex before marriage is a sin and use contracting sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy outside wedlock as reasons to maintain abstinence. Deb said: “Safe sex is a total and complete myth. There is no such thing as safe sex. The reason I have genital herpes today is because someone told me there was such a thing as safe sex.” There is nothing negative that can possibly come as a result of waiting until marriage.” At the ceremony, fathers are given a key, representing their daughters chastity, to eventually pass on to their daughter’s future husband. Both father and daughter then sign a purity contract and the daughters are given a purity ring to wear on their wedding ring finger.

Our quality shone through.”On  minutes Locos were close when Joe McCabe glanced Neil McLean’s free-kick from the left just wide.Midway through the half Locos keeper Andy Reid made a fine save to thwart Gary McGowan’s shot from the edge of the area after the striker’s fleet footwork created an opening.Soon after, McGowan latched on to Nick Gray’s through ball and fired inches wide from just inside the box. At the other end, for Locos Gauld’s overhead kick dropped just wide.Just four minutes into the second period Huntly were ahead when Nick GRAY drove forward and unleashed a stunning -yard shot into the top left corner.At the other end Euan Storrier palmed away Gauld’s close range effort.On  minutes Storrier made an excellent save to tip McCabe’s header on to the bar after the attacker met Greg Mitchell’s cross from the right.The Black and Golds could not clear and Storrier had to save seconds later from Gauld.When the resultant corner was played back in Locos did level. Mark Souter’s -yard shot hit the left post and MITCHELL knocked home the rebound from six yards.With  minutes to play Huntly’s Ryan McRitchie rattled the left post from  yards after collecting McGowan’s free-kick.On  minutes it was - Locos when GAULD met Jordan Leyden’s corner from the right and headed home at the near post from six yards.Four minutes later victory was sealed when Stuart Duff’s pass released GAULD and he rounded Storrier to finish.Huntly manager Martin Skinner said: “In the first half we were very good and should have been ahead.“But in the second half we froze. We didn’t come out in the first  minutes and you can’t do that against Locos.“It’s frustrating because in the first half we showed a lot of promise.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boyle gets tough on recovery road","story":"Paddy Boyle believes Peterhead being out of action this weekend can benefit him.The left-back has started the Blue Toon’s last two games, the - win over Annan Athletic and Saturday’s - victory at home to Elgin City.Prior to that he made his debut for the Buchan outfit as a sub in a - win against Berwick Rangers on September .Boyle had endured a frustrating start to his time at Balmoor after suffering a nerve injury in pre-season.He is pleased to have overcome the injury and will have this weekend off as Peterhead don’t have a game due to the third round of the Irn-Bru Cup taking place.Boyle is expected to feature tonight in a bounce game that Blue Toon boss Jim McInally has organised against Forfar.The -year-old believes having the weekend off will help him when they face Kelty Hearts in the Scottish Cup a week on Saturday because he will be closer to being fully match fit after having three or four training sessions and tonight’s bounce game. Boyle said: “I’m starting to feel good.“I had my first  minutes against Annan a week past Saturday and I was knackered with  minutes to go.“But the gaffer kept me on in that game which has probably done me good in the long run.“On Saturday against Elgin I was a wee bit tired towards the end, but I’ll feel stronger for it so it’s good I’m getting there.“You want to keep playing competitive games.“But the weekend off might do someone like myself good because I can do tough training sessions and play the bounce game and have longer to recover.“It means I can do potentially four tough sessions instead of just one or two in a normal week.“So this might work out better for myself.”After the first quarter of League Two fixtures Peterhead are second in the table with  points, two adrt of leaders Edinburgh City.Boyle added: “It’s an excellent haul for the first nine games andyou’d offered us that we’d have taken it.“We’re not top of the league, but it just shows there are other good teams in this league.“We have to maintain this level andwe can do that we should be good.“I think we have set a standard for going forward.“We’ve got everyone fit now and we’ve got competition for places so it does raise everyone’s games.“The Elgin game was probably the first time in a few weeks that we’ve hit the levels that are expected.”"},{"url":null,"title":"i got my skates on to be fit for ultras","story":"An Aberdeen-based former figure skater from Romania is making a name for herself on the Scottish ultra-distance running scene.Alice Mezincescu,who is working towards her PhD at the institute of medical sciences at Aberdeen University, recently produced two memorable performances within seven days.She won the top women’s prize in the Speyside Way race, recording hrs min secs for the -mile course between Ballindalloch and Buckie.A week later the -year-old was second woman, sixth overall, in the Glenmore -hour race in which she completed just over  miles. These are remarkable results given that Mezincescu was inspired to take up the sport just two years ago after picking up a book.She said: “One day I was looking at a book about eating and running written by the American ultra distance athlete Scott Jurek.“I was actually searching for a recipe but then read about this guy doing the Western States -mile endurance race.“I had never heard of ultra running and it sounded crazy. However, it inspired me and I decided I would like to try some ultra marathons.“I hadn’t done much running before. Figure skating was my main sport, not at a serious level, but I enjoyed it as a hobby.“To keep fit for that I would run round the rink and I’d also do maybe three runs a week, totally about km, but no more than that.”Mezincescu moved to the UK from Romania around  years ago after graduating with a medical degree.She worked in the Oxford and Cardf areas before taking up her post at Aberdeen University in , and that coincided with her decision to become an ultra runner.She said: “When I got here I was taken on a visit to the Braemar area and I just loved the breathtaking scenery. There are so many beautul places to run, so I knew I would enjoy trying all the dferent trails.“I tried to enter the -mile Great Glen Ultra. I was asked what previous experience I had, but had to admit I hadn’t done anything. So, I needed to run a few races to prove I was capable of doing it.“The first one I tried was the Dee -mile race between Aberdeen and Banchory. It was very dficult.“Then I did the Cateran Trail race at Glenshee and eventually I was able to do the Great Glen Ultra and managed it quite well.”Mezincescu, who joined a friend at Banchory Running Club, has since made great progress but admits to not having any structured training plan.She said: “Most people seem to have a plan but I have nothing structured at all. I run up to km most nights,I can, depending on work commitments. I find it’s a great way to relieve any stress.“At weekends I love to run in the hills and aim to do -km on Saturdays and Sundays. When I was training for the Speyside Way race I was getting up to km in a week but generally I do -km.”Mezincescu admits to being amazed by the success she has enjoyed in her two recent races.She said: “Winning the Speyside race was a big surprise. I was really treating it as a training run for the Glenmore -hour race the following week.“Glenmore was the first time I had tried running for  hours. It was an amazing experience and my support crew were great.“I tried to stop as little as possible during the event. I even minimised the time I stopped for food and drink as every minute counts.“At the end I couldn’t believe I was in second position.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.There was some suspicion over the intentions of health and social care managers at the recent meeting of Mid Argyll Health and Care Forum .Members felt their recent behaviour might be a precursor to changing the forum set-up to make it saferand more homogenised across the region.But there was also strong feeling the HCF should be better attended by public representatives such as community councillors.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run.

First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them.

This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked.

Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road.

Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"entertainment-in-the-dock-at-scotts-selkirk","story":"SELKIRK is set for a treble turn of tourist delights this weekend.Not only is the hugely popular Scotts Selkirk ing to the Royal Burgh on Saturday, but the town will also host the foot-tapping delights of the Selkirk Sessions as well as the new monthly Farmers Market.The busy weekend comes just as the new-look Market Place refurbishments are completed.Viv Ross from Scotts Selkirk told us: \"A busy weekend is in store ndash with something for everyone.\"We look forward to welcoming everyone to our annual celebrations.\"Dozens of Souters will turn back the clock to relive the days of Scott.As well as re-enactments, period costumes and fayre from centuries gone, there will be plenty of street entertainment throughout Scotts Selkirk.Meg Dodsrsquo ever-popular Kitchen has been relocated to the High Street.The music and puppets of Crafty Beggars will share the town centre with Les Amies drsquoOnos Billy Bowler the Performing Goat.And there will be plenty Victorian childrenrsquos games, including Splat the Rat and a coconut shy, to keep the youngsters entertained.Matthew Burgess has taken over the role of Town Cryer from his late father Bob.And he will be accompanied by young drummer boys Hamish and Cameron throughout his duties.George Renton will ride into town with his penny-farthing.And this year there will also be a Scottrsquos Selkirk shop window treasure hunt ndash with forms available from the Scottrsquos Selkirk Shop.This year Sir Walter Scott will be presiding over The Tall Tale of the Tushielaw Trout, and the Lady Varnishes in his Courtroom.Down below the Courthouse Gael Force, Carlenjig, The Bogie Close Stompers, Highline Fiddlers, Bob Liddle and the Riddell Fiddles will all adorn the stage at some point during the packed programme.Viv added: \"We are really looking forward to the open mic sessions where we will no doubt be treated to some exceptional music.\"There will also be a host of talented buskers in both the Market Place and the High Street to add to the entertainment.\"As well as Scotts Selkirk, the Farmers Market will operate on Saturday and throughout the weekend -

incredible patience and understanding with the repair programme to date.\"Having listened to their concerns, we consider it prudent to avoid further disruption over the busy holiday season.\"This strategy will also mitigate against the possible impact that winter weather might have on this workldquoOnce again, we want to thank road users, businesses and residents for their goodwill, and we will continue to consult with local stakeholders and provide updates on this scheme .Exact dates for the  works will be announced in the coming

phone calls from concerned constituents about the recent building work in Bowmore.It has seen a footpath being built over one side of Bowmore#s rugby pitch.I had a meeting with the Islay rugby team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this

Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured pound, from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry. Chief stitcher Liz Neilson and her team will lead the work.Volunteer stitchers are welcome to attend future workshops at the Old Town Hall from am to pm on October  and , November  and December .Alister Hadden, treasurer of the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group, said: \"We were delighted with how well attended the launch event was.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian. You have Ormiston which has doubled or trebled in size, yoursquore going to have all these houses on the south side, and theyrsquore all still going to go down Tranent High Street.

Itrsquos not been explicitly the case. People could have come in from outside.ldquoThe fact that we are actually providing a vehicle for continuity of community is very satisfying. But we wouldnrsquot want to exclude other people who are in need.More than  people from the local area applied for the homes before they had even been advertised, but Mr Robertson was keen to point out that the need for affordable housing was not desperate.ldquoI donrsquot think therersquos a desperate need but itrsquos an expanding local authority economy, he said.ldquoTo call it a desperate demand may be slightly overstating it. There are parts of the country where you could go where there is a desperate need for social housing.ldquoThere is social housing here and therersquos a responsible housing department and good housing associations and we are working very much as part of that mix. I donrsquot think anybody is talking about things being desperate.ldquoThere is a need and itrsquos being met in a controlled and effective way.Ward councillor Neil Gilbert was also present at the handing-over of the keys and told the Courier that the development was ldquoextremely important.He said: ldquoThis is hopefully a step to a lot more of these properties being provided. The level of rent that these facilities house is what East Lothian needs.ldquoThis is a step in the right direction but letrsquos hope itrsquos a springboard for a lot more.ldquoWe need as many affordable properties as we can.

Indeed, it will almost certainly continue after that. My reading of the negotiations is that Britain is heading towards a ldquoSwitzerland minus outcome. The Swiss are not members of the EU, or the EEA or formally the European Single Market. However, they accept all the rules of the ESM on a ldquobilateral basis, meaning that they accept changes as they come along, not en masse, as it were.Itrsquos a fine distinction, and most people agree that Switzerland is in the single market for all intents and purposes. It accepts the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, and largely rubber-stamps rulings of the European Court of Justice. However, it is not actually in the ESM, which makes it Brexit-compliant. Mrs May will try to get a Switzerland-type deal, minus any formal acceptance of freedom of movement. But this will likely be fudged over a y transition in which the destination will be clear, but neither side will openly admit it.Except for Ms Sturgeon, who will want to call a spade a spade. If there is a transition deal that explicitly confirms regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland with the single market ndash which is what the ldquohybrid backstop also seems to involve ndash she will rightly call for Scotland to get parity. The Northern Ireland back-stop is similar to the hybrid arrangement she proposed for Scotland in the Scottish Government White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe, back in . .But the downside is that Brussels and the UK could end up with an open-ended transition period in which Britain is out of the European Union, but remains in an uncertain relationship to its institutions. This means Scottish voters could be no clearer on our long-term relations with Europe than they are now. This purgatory could easily last  years, during which no UK government will agree to an independence referendum for Scotland, on the grounds that nothing is clear until everything is clear.I suspect realisation that the fog of Brexit is going to linger helped persuade the First Minister, belatedly, to support a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit. On the BBC Andrew Marr show she made clear SNP MPs will vote for a repeat referendum on Brexit, eventhere is no guarantee of indyref. The polls may indicate that support for independence would rise with a hard Brexit, but it is much better for the cause of Scottish independencethe UK doesnrsquot leave the EU at all. It would mean Scotland could seamlessly depart from the UK without there being any hard border with England, and without Scotland having to formally leave the EU.There is now a slim chance that a Peoplersquos Vote might happen. That Britain will wake up from the Brexit nightmare. But that would be a triumph of hope over experience."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-why-pragmatism-and-patience-have-to-be-the-order-of-the-day-for-snp","story":"Nicola Sturgeon wants to keep hope alive, but shersquos not going to call any referendum she canrsquot be sure of winning.

However, they accept all the rules of the ESM on a ldquobilateral basis, meaning that they accept changes as they come along, not en masse, as it were.Itrsquos a fine distinction, and most people agree that Switzerland is in the single market for all intents and purposes. It accepts the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, and largely rubber-stamps rulings of the European Court of Justice. However, it is not actually in the ESM, which makes it Brexit-compliant. Mrs May will try to get a Switzerland-type deal, minus any formal acceptance of freedom of movement. But this will likely be fudged over a y transition in which the destination will be clear, but neither side will openly admit it.Except for Ms Sturgeon, who will want to call a spade a spade. If there is a transition deal that explicitly confirms regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland with the single market ndash which is what the ldquohybrid backstop also seems to involve ndash she will rightly call for Scotland to get parity. The Northern Ireland back-stop is similar to the hybrid arrangement she proposed for Scotland in the Scottish Government White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe, back in . .But the downside is that Brussels and the UK could end up with an open-ended transition period in which Britain is out of the European Union, but remains in an uncertain relationship to its institutions. This means Scottish voters could be no clearer on our long-term relations with Europe than they are now. This purgatory could easily last  years, during which no UK government will agree to an independence referendum for Scotland, on the grounds that nothing is clear until everything is clear.I suspect realisation that the fog of Brexit is going to linger helped persuade the First Minister, belatedly, to support a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit. On the BBC Andrew Marr show she made clear SNP MPs will vote for a repeat referendum on Brexit, eventhere is no guarantee of indyref. The polls may indicate that support for independence would rise with a hard Brexit, but it is much better for the cause of Scottish independencethe UK doesnrsquot leave the EU at all. It would mean Scotland could seamlessly depart from the UK without there being any hard border with England, and without Scotland having to formally leave the EU.There is now a slim chance that a Peoplersquos Vote might happen. That Britain will wake up from the Brexit nightmare. But that would be a triumph of hope over experience."},{"url":null,"title":"benedetti-and-300-young-string-players-celebrate-10-years-of-big-noise-in-dundee","story":"The Festival of Strings, held in the Caird Hall, Dundee, was the culmination of three tutorial sessions for young string players led by the award-winning musician.These tutorial sessions, called Super Strings, have been held in Aberdeen, Glasgow and Stirling, and were organised with the Big Noise youth orchestras.Ms Benedetti said she had been moved by the coming together of the more than  young players in Dundee and would be \"definitely doing it again.\"\"To see some of the strongest and great players in the country, and the children who have not been playing very long, all playing together is special - the collective spirit is really quite amazing,\" she said.The children involved play violin, viola, cello and double bass and had previously attended one of the Super Strings Sessions for beginner, intermediate and advanced string players.They were joined by teachers and children from the four Big Noise projects in Raploch in Stirling, Govanhill in Glasgow, Torry in Aberdeen and Douglas in Dundee.The musica, which was led by conductor Feacutelix Bricentildeo, included lsquoPolka Dot Polkarsquo, movements from Warlockrsquos lsquoCapriol Suitersquo, lsquoTempestrsquo by James Redwood and works by Sibelius and Grieg.Benedetti, who has previously stated she wants to increase the amount of educational work she does - fitting it in her busy schedule of concerts and recording - tutored the children in technique and the sound of their instruments.The sessions are part of the events being held to celebrate the th birthday of the establishment of Sistema Scotland, the charity which runs the Big Noise programmes.Benedetti added: ldquoThis has been an immense opportunity for me, personally, to give something back to Scotland as part of my work advocating for high quality music education and the impact it can have.

The investigation also found just three companies own more than half of Englandrsquos quota while some fishermen hoard quota on vessels which never cast a net.Nearly half of England and Walesrsquo quota is held by companies based outside the those countries, despite reforms to the EUrsquos fisheries policy which encourage national governments to allocate fishing quota on social and environmental grounds.It is claimed that the ownership of quota by large-scale fishing firms also poses greater risk to the environment and fish stocksmore destructive fishing practices are deployed, an allegation strenuously denied by the families themselves.Scottish Greens environment spokesman Mark Ruskell MSP said: ldquoThis investigation should serve as a reminder that much of Scotlandrsquos fishing industry is in the grip of a handful of very rich people ... , many of them putting profit before science, happy to wipe the seas clean rather than manage stocks sustainably so we have food for the future.ldquoFishing industry voices have actively encouraged the kind of deregulated free-for-all the Toriesrsquo Brexit crisis is dragging us toward, posing massive risks to jobs and public services in our coastal communities.  per cent of whatrsquos caught in Scottish waters is sold to the EU so the isolationism of Brexit will ruin our export economy.ldquoIf we want a future for fisheries we need to distribute quotas to more local and sustainable operators.

The huge sums have been made by large-scale fishermen, with five wealthy families controlling one-third of Scotlandrsquos total quota, despite the entire pelagic fleet consisting of just  vessels.But for those outside the big companies, fishing is becoming a less and less profitable pursuit due to a quota system that favours larger enterprises over small vessels.A study by Greenpeacersquos investigative unit claims to reveal a vastly unequal system where a minority of wealthy families control huge swathes of fishing rights to the detriment of local fishermen.In desperation, many small scale fishermen resort to contacting larger outfits, or those they know have Fixed Quota Allocationsthat they do not fish. Those owners can set their own prices and lease out quota, allowing the fisherman to catch more.The prices set for leasing out FQA can y by hundreds of pounds. To lease a tonne of cod for example, can cost from pound to pound. The resulting catch might bring just pound, at market, meaning a profit margin of pound before staff and equipment costs.According to Greenpeace, the situation has left some fishermen going out on boats alone because they cannot afford to pay a crew, while others have found that, after boat costs, they are still losing money and have stopped fishing altogether.Jerry Percy, founder of the Under Ten Fishermenrsquos Association, which represents small scale fishermen, said: ldquoThe fish in our seas are a public resource, itrsquos yours and mine, managed by Government on our behalf. They should therefore never be treated as just another commodity, to be bought and sold to the highest bidder.ldquoThe hoarding of quota risks creating a distorted market in which the price of fish stocks, and access to them, is controlled by just a few companies.The problem, say critics, dates back to the s when economists argued that the problem of diminishing fish stocks brought about by fleet expansion and mass industrialisation should be solved by the market. They proposed that states create a limited right to catch fish that could be bought and sold.Iceland was one of the first countries to implement this market-based policy in the Eighties. Their fish stocks began to recover and the fishing fleet grew more profitable. But the privatisation of once common fishing-rights led to many fishermen becoming dispossessed as banks started trading in fishing rights and the system eventually crashed.In the UK, the price of large fishing boats and their associated right-to-fish has rocketed, which has led to many young people being priced out. In many cases only large companies with the backing of banks can buy boats.Greenpeace hope the UK can succeed where Iceland failed, and rein in the market to create a fairer system.Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ldquoHow long before the Government stops blaming other countries, looks at its own broken system, accepts responsibility for fixing it and creates a fairer and more sustainable distribution of fishing quota across the UK  With the Fisheries Bill rumoured to be just weeks away, there has never been a better opportunity to do just this.A spokesman for Lunar Fishing said: ldquoThe quota available to the inshore fleetis more than the under-m fleet can catch, so there is no merit in the suggestion that there is disadvantage to the lsquosmall-scale fishermenrsquo.ldquoIn fact the vast majority of fish caught requires larger vessels to catch because of location, depth and weather challenges. It would be impossible for the inshore fleet to catch a small percentage of the quota.ldquoIn relation to workforce, Lunar uses the quota to employ around  people in the local communities of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen. Many more are employed in providing services to the company.A spokesman for Sir Ian Woodrsquos fishing arm, the Don Fishing Co and JW Holdings, said: ldquoBoth come from strong fish catching backgrounds with Sir Ian Woodrsquos father, grandfather and great grandfather all being fishermen. The Don operates as a management and fish selling company working on behalf of about  vessels in which it has mainly minority shares and another  vessels which it helps manage and sell the fish. The Don Corsquos one and only reason for owning some quota itself and helping a large number of fishing vessels to buy their own quota is to enable the vessels to have sufficient quota to be viable.A spokesman for Andrew Marr International said: ldquoAMI fully supports robust fishery management including full compliance to protect fish stocks and sustainable fishing. AMI has  vessels in the English Fully Documented Fishery Scheme with on board camera monitoring.ldquoThe main stocks that AMI fishes for in the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, monkfish. In these species, the Under  fleet have excess quota that they have not used in the last several years.A spokesman for Interfish said: ldquoAcross our fleet we were the first UK fleet to achieve full certication against the Responsible Fishing Scheme in  and maintained this against the new standard in  ndash no other fleet of skippers have achieved this standard.ldquoInterfish are active within several MSC client groups enabling sustainable certication of offshore and inshore fisheries."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-can-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-make-scotland-happy","story":"What you do therefore is grab your audience where you can, when you can.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am. A soup and sandwich lunch will be served at .pm after the event ends.To book your place in this free event, contact Age Scotland on    or helen.simpson@agescotland.org.uk by October .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Thursday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A provisional thumbs up had been given by the CMA at the end of August.SSE welcomed the decision to give the merger the green light, which will create the UK’s second biggest energy supplier after British Scottish Gas.Under the deal, the new company will be listed on the London Stock Exchange with SSE shareholders holding . per cent and Npower owner Innogy holding . per cent. The merged group will serve some . million customers.Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, said: “This is a complex transaction and there is still much work to do in the coming weeks and months.“However, we’ve always believed that the creation of a new, independent energy and services retailer has potential to deliver real benefits for customers and the market as a whole and it is good to see that the CMA has cleared the transaction following what was a comprehensive and rigorous inquiry.”The CMA had launched a full inquiry into the merger after its initial investigation found that the tie-up could reduce competition, potentially leading to higher prices for households.The regulator added that the incoming UK government-enforced price cap would also help protect customers on iable deals. Anne Lambert, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: “With many energy companies out there, people switching away from expensive standard iable tarfs will still have plenty of choice when they shop around after this merger.“But we know that the energy market still isn’t working well for many people who don’t switch, so we looked carefully at how the merger would affect SVT prices.“Following a thorough investigation and consultation, we are confident that SSE and Npower are not close rivals for these customers and so the deal will not change how they set SVT prices.”Victoria Arrington at comparison site Energyhelpline said: “Even with the SSE-Npower merger going ahead, the energy market is still large and ied.“A competitive market with lots of quality players is what can help keep energy prices low for consumers.“With more than  suppliers to choose from, consumers have loads of opportunities to seek out a great energy deal,” she added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact.

Islands proofing – ensuring the islands are recognised in any law or government regulation – must work.#There are too many cases right now where that is not happening, such as the government imposing car parking charges on leline airports where there is no public transport alternative.#For the Islands Act to be worth the parchment it’s written on, these things must change.#Islands Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: #The Scottish Islands have contributed and continue to contribute hugely to our culture and heritage and, with this Act now starting to take force, will now have the opportunity to contribute even further to their own and our collective futures.#They have very distinctive needs so the Act introduces a number of measures to ensure there is a sustained focus across government and the wider public sector to meet the needs of island communities now and in the future.“On a more visual front, it ensures Shetland will no longer be ‘boxed off’ on maps which has been a cause of irritation to those living in Shetland.#When producing a map of Scotland, the Shetland Islands must therefore be displayed in a way that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland.“It introduces a new duty on Scottish ministers and the wider public sector to have regard to island communities when exercising their s and preparing policy, strategies, services and legislation – known as “island-proofing”.“And the National Islands Plan will also be produced which, amongst other things, gives us a strategic direction to improve outcomes for our islands by creating the right environment for investment, empowerment and increasing sustainable economic growth.” raquoI#m glad to hear that Shetlandcan#t be put into a box on maps. It#s a start to getting the northern isles properly represented in their correct position on an atlas.On a similar line, in a number of the paper atlases of UK that I have, the northernisles are represented at a completely dferent scale. In an old OS map book, the southis shown at mile to the inch whilst the Northern isles are shown at about  miles to the inch. Similarly, a road atlas produced by RAC has The South shown at  miles to the inch whilst the northern isles can only get about . miles to the inch.So, the next step should be to get the northern islands correctly represented in scale as well as position.Saw a duvet set for sale in Debenhams in Inverness. you should see where they have put Shetland on their map.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"team leader at shetland home cope ltd ","story":"Are you just the right person to join our dynamic social enterprise, which promotes skill development for people with learning disabilities  We are looking for someone with the following to lead our busy team:Strong leadership and Retail Management experienceA passion for re-use and recycling..COPE Ltd is a charity and social enterprise."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush laxo vidlin ","story":"Offers over £,Originally used as a fishing lodge the property comprises two reception rooms , kitchen   diner, modern shower room, cloak room  store   utility area , on the ground floor, plus three double bedrooms  shower room on the first floor.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter.

not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

was a rock and an inspiration","story":"#The Rock of the family# - emotional tributes have been paid to Cindy Greer, who died suddenly in a car crash last Thursday near her home in Gilford. A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics. We are so grateful to them, as this allowed us as a family to spend more time with Cindy.Kneed teenager in head and kicked him on ground Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We were all there as a family at her beside - everyone had a hand on her as she passed away at .pm on Thursday afternoon,” said Alan.Cindy’s daughter Rachel said: “Mum always said the worst thing a parent could watch was a child go before them. But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well.

Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch .

Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall.Roisin’s relief as decision to deny PIP is overturnedPic of the day, Thursday, October Search The Site \" onblur\"\"  Advertising Belfast Media Group copy .

We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”Pic of the Day, Wednesday, October Johnnies haven’t missed the boat insists McNultySearch The Site \" onblur\"\"  Advertising Belfast Media Group copy .

In his evidence, which the tribunal accepted, Mr Matier recalled that when he was giving his details to a man at the premises he was asked to state his age. When he replied that he was , he was told: \"I was looking for a younger person who I could train and move upstairs.\" Mr Matier askedthere was any point in continuing the conversation, and was told: \"No, not really.\"He said: \"I had been keen to get this job, and to be told I was too old to even apply for it really shook me. \"I had been off work for a while and I was trying to get back in to work. It was disheartening and it made me angry that my application could just be dismissed in this way because of my age.\"In its finding, the tribunal acknowledged that the incident \"had the effect of signicantly discouraging the claimant\". It added: \"This had been caused entirely by the behaviour of the respondent and this behaviour was motivated by age discrimination.\"Mr Matiers claim was supported by the Equality Commission.Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission, said: \"This case is an important reminder to all employers not to make generalised assumptions about people on grounds such as age, which are protected by anti-discrimination law.\"It is unlawful under the Employment Equality Age Regulations of  for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age in the arrangements they make when offering employment.\"The tribunal in its finding noted that Mr Matier \"was, in effect, given no opportunity on the grounds of his age\". Ms Kitson added: \"That goes to the heart of the case and it quite rightly caused Mr Matier major disappointment at a time when he was attempting to re-enter the workplace in very trying circumstances.\"No employer should be making assumptions about a persons ability, or suitability for training and promotion, because of their age.\"Spring  AirbrakeLtd said it was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision and will be applying to have it reviewed.It said: \"This decision sets a very dangerous precedent for any employer defending claims of discrimination, in that the tribunal determined that the claimant was discriminated against, despite ascertaining that the evidence of the claimant was a little imprecise and vague.\"On behalf of the respondents, we will be applying to have this decision formally reviewed.\"We also intend writing to the Department for Communities seeking a review of their recruitment services. \"The respondent followed the approved process for advertising their vacancy with the Jobs and Benefits Office and strictly adhered to the procedure.\"The company said the absence of an employment appeal tribunal led to an \"imbalance\".It added: \"Should a review fail to address the shortcomings of this decision, the only avenue open to the respondent is to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, which for any company is extremely prohibitive financially.\""},{"url":null,"title":"derry factory girls tribute scrapped after 85k in public","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The committee heard that principals have reported \"intolerable strain\" caused by the deteriorating financial position placed upon them.Other key pressures raised during yesterdays committee include the increased need for early intervention to meet the growing and increasingly complex needs of children. There is also an increasing need for support to children who have additional and special educational needs.MPs were told of the need to close attainment gaps and improve the skills levels of children and young people. Speaking afterwards, Ms OConnor said there was a clear need to transform the education sector. \"This will require investment galvanising the skills and innovative thinking of the people within the sector,\" she said.\"This transformation will deliver improved value for money in the use of public funds and will enable and support school leaders to deliver improved outcomes.\"Transformation has already begun and improvements and progress has been made with school performance and investment in the schools estate through new buildings. \"To propel this further we support the identication of earmarked resources, for example a transformation investment fund to support the continued modernisation of services, skills and culture, to transform the system and to immediately support schools, children and young people and services during transformation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"rich source of forensic evidence lost in decommissioning psni chief","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

to “do a day of work”..pushA police whistleblower whose malpractice claims almost brought down the Irish Government faced unfounded and  allegations of a sexual assault.Sergeant Maurice McCabe had accused the force of malpractice including the quashing of penalty points, and later made a complaint against former commissioner Martin Callinan, the head of the Irish police force.An unfounded allegation was first made against Sgt McCabe in , and by April  the Director of Public Prosecutions decided no offence had been disclosed and social services decided to take no further action.The Disclosures Tribunal report, published on Thursday, noted: “That should have been the end of any allegation that Maurice McCabe had ever sexually assaulted a child.”In , within a counselling organisation, a mistake was made in transcribing an account of rape by a dferent woman, attributing the accusation to Sgt McCabe’s alleged complainant.A mistaken report was then made to the gardai by Tusla in  alleging that Sgt McCabe had been accused of a rape offence.At a time when there was considerable public interest in Sgt McCabe after he had disclosed bad practice within the gardai, an incorrect report, accusing him of a rape offence, was maintained in Garda Headquarters.“When the Northern Region learned of the inaccuracy of that report, the assistant commissioner did not correct it to Garda Headquarters,” the report said.“The  report had an afterle within Tusla, because of the astounding inefficiency of that organisation and the inertia of its management.”The report also criticised the agency for its reaction to criticism and their senior management’s appearance before the tribunal.Both the reaction of Tusla and the reaction of An Garda Siochana to mistakes both made are dishearteningDisclosures Tribunal reportFacebookTwitter“The soundness of any organisation may usefully be judged by the reaction it has to the mistakes it makes.“Both the reaction of Tusla and the reaction of An Garda Siochana to mistakes both made are disheartening.“Central to dealing with inefficiencies and with mistakes, as an inevitable part of human le, is the need to face up to them, to report honestly on them and to address them by improvement.“The response from within Tusla, at least, has been for senior officials to appear before the tribunal and to offer withering criticisms of structures, personnel and conduct within the organisation.“It is not for the tribunal to advise on administrative matters beyond saying that it is clear that management need to wake up and actually do a day of work.“Whatever changes need to be made can be identied from this report and through the exercise of common sense.”The saga surrounding the handling of his disclosure of alleged wrongdoing among police in the Irish border counties of Cavan-Monaghan contributed to the end of the careers of former taoiseach Enda Kenny, two former chiefs of the Garda force and ex-justice minister and later deputy prime minister Frances Fitzgerald.The Child and Family Agencyis the dedicated State agency responsible for improving wellbeing and outcomes for children."},{"url":null,"title":"patisserie

Housmans from the Shropshire Lad . “Into my heart on air that kills, From yon far country blows: What are those blue remembered hills, What spires, what farms are those  “That is the land of lost

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy. He said it will also be a pleasure for the local authorityrsquos leisure staff to move to a modern building.The senior council official said everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially, deserve credit for the part they played..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down High pupils make waves at RYA  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos sailors took to the water at the weekend with over  others to battle it out at the RYA Northern Ireland Youth Championships and Schools Cup at Cultra.The sailors from the Downpatrick school battled hard in tough conditions, with a special mention to going to Adam Fermor, sailing in the Laser Standard fleet, who made a clean sweep, with five first place podium finished from five races.Evie Mclaughlin also performed impressively, finishing as third lady overall, in the Laser Radial Fleet.

The former motocross ace has offered his expertise to teach young riders basic biking skills.ldquoMotorcycling is getting bigger every year, Mr McBride said. Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said. Balance and technique are important.ldquoAnother important area is maintenance.

Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take. Each Round Table has received tickets on which you can guess the mileage on the car when the journey ends.Fty pence is the price per guess and the winner will receive pound. In this way, the Round Table hope to raise in excess of pound, for their selected charity.

The winning ticket will be announced at lunch on Sunday.DOWNPATRICK mdash Window-smashing, ransacking vandals left their trademark on yet another school last week when they broke into St Patrickrsquos Boysrsquo Primary School in Downpatrick.The St Dillonrsquos Avenue school was badly vandalised with the tuck shop destroyed, windows and door  smashed and ious types of equipment wrecked.The latest incident happened last Wednesday night and came less than a week after police had been allied to see the extent of the damage caused by vandals at the nearby St Maryrsquos Secondary School on the Ardglass Road.On that occasion pictures and statues were knocked off walls and broken and several other items, including doors, were badly damaged. Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

Her mother, Nina Greer, was from Downpatrick, and she also spent much of her childhood in Castlewellan where her father died shortly after she was born.Miss Garson, who will always be remembered for her performances in classic films like Goodbye Mr Chips, which she made in , won an Academy Award for Mrs Miniver in .CROSSGAR mdash Talented Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKillen took a major award for the second successive year at the recent Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Her outstanding performance as Arline in Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos production of The Bohewian Girl earned her the trophy for the best Irish singer and led the adjudicator to comment ldquoa beautul voice mdash an excellent performance.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Andrew McCormick yesterday at the RHI Inquiry During yesterday’s hearing, Dr McCormick came under pressure to explain the repeated failures within his department and several actions where he personally should have acted more robustly in that period.Dr McCormick, one of Stormont’s most experienced mandarins, was asked about a private July  email from Dr Crawford to Mr Cairns in which he warned there would be “a massive spike” in applications to RHI and referred to “abuse” of the scheme.In another email, Dr Crawford explicitly said that “it pays producers to heat houses when their houses are empty as the rates are attractive”.Dr McCormick said he did not recall being warned about such a spike and that “wasn’t part of the discussion” at that point.He said: “It seems crystal clear from this email that Andrew Crawford understood the perverse incentive in the scheme in a way that we at that time did not. We should have [because] Janette O’Hagan had explained to us in very straightforward terms ... Andrew Crawford clearly understands it: ‘It pays producers to heat houses when their houses are empty as the rates are attractive’.“That’s a straightforward summary of the fundamental flaw in the scheme.”Referring to another of Dr Crawford’s emails, Dr McCormick said that the DUP Spad was “even clearer” in his understanding of the issue because “he explains the nature of the abuse that was at the heart of the problem”.He said: “Why neither Timothy nor Andrew came to us and said: This is what’s happening, here’s why it’s going wrong, here’s why you’ve got a sudden upturn in uptake –you’d even put that together with [finance official] Trevor Cooper’s points about suspicions about over-compensation, the opportunity for everything to fall into place and for us to realise the nature of the problem that we had and therefore to have acted urgently and to immediately fix it is an incredible lost opportunity.“I can’t see how there was not a consciousness to bring it to our attention on the part of both Andrew and Timothy.”Panel member Dame Una O’Brien asked: “Do you think it was being kept from you.”Dr McCormick said: “Yes. Well, that’s what happened. It was kept from us.”Body discovered on NI beachMotorcyclist dies following crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The mandarin went on: “To understand that, to know from the submission that we have a problem and we’re trying to solve the problem and not to say ‘you don’t understand your problem – here’s the real understanding’ is that not straightforwardly withholding information “It seems very, very clear to me that it is withholding information that was relevant to the submission that they both had.”Mr Cairns did, however, have some discussion with Dr McCormick’s deputy, Chris Stewart, about the issue because Mr Stewart emailed fellow officials a few days later to say that Mr Cairns “is concerned that there may be a further spike in demand”, although he did not use the phrase “massive”.And Mr Cairns has already told the inquiry that in that period he raised allegations of abuse of the scheme with Mr Stewart but that the department did not take the issue seriously.Dr McCormick was asked about multiple warnings to his officials about abuse of RHI which were ignored or dismissed. One of those warnings, a letter from boiler installer Solmatix in the summer of , alleged that some “unscrupulous” RHI claimants in the poultry sector were “actively exploiting it”.He said that should have been raised with the department’s internal auditors and others who could have investigated the allegation, but nothing appears to have been done.The department had been warned before about a failure to adequately listen to whistle-blowers and claimed that it had learnt lessons.Dr McCormick said that the evidence presented to the inquiry showed how much “noise” was being made by those contacting the department in dferent ways to make allegations of abuse or raise concerns about the scheme.He added: “Why it wasn’t heard – or whyit was heard it wasn’t acted on – I find deeply concerning.”He said that in the case of the letter from Solmatix, the source of the warning was known to the officials receiving it and therefore it would have had more weight. “The letter was also referring to ‘not possible abuse – they’re referring to ‘unscrupulous beneficiaries appearing to be actively exploiting it’.”Dr McCormick said: “It seems to me that a senior manager reading that would say: Stop everything we need to look at this we need to understand this what is going on here  “We need a very quick assessment as to whether this is spurious – is there any way in which this can be spurious  Or,there is substance, then we have to ask much more fundamental questions.“I can’t see how it can be read any other way than [as] something of a serious nature.”try catch     .               ..

I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards. The company has ersied and grown in influence, with Mr McConville one of just two Northern Ireland business leaders joining Prime Minister Theresa May on an international trade mission to China.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/group_v2_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland building long term business partnerships","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by Ulster Business Eugene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group, Bank of Irelands Gavin Kennedy, Bridgene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group alongside Eamon McCay, Frylite, and Brian Connolly, Pinnacle Bank of Ireland UK has been backing Northern Ireland businesses across the generations. Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.
