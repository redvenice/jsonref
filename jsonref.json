[{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrew offers cooperate Jeffery Epstein investigation","story":"Share this article Andrew has categorically denied having any knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing teenage girls. The prince announced that he was withdrawing from his royal duties late last year amid renewed attention over his friendship with Epstein, and Giuffre\u0027s claim that she had several sexual encounters with the prince, starting when she was just 17.Giuffre says that after meeting her in Florida in 2000, Epstein flew her around the world and pressured her into having sex with numerous older men, including Andrew, two senior US politicians, a noted academic, wealthy financiers and the attorney Alan Dershowitz, who is now part of President Donald Trump\u0027s impeachment defense team.All of those men have denied the allegations.Giuffre has said she had sex with Andrew three times at Epstein\u0027s request, including once in London in 2001 at the home of Epstein\u0027s girlfriend, Maxwell.Andrew has maintained that he does not recall ever meeting Giuffre - even though there is a photograph apparently showing him with his arm around the then-17-year-old on the night she says she first slept with him.            Prince Andrew is pictured with Epstein in Central Park in New York in February 2011         Virginia Roberts, who claims that Prince Andrew had sex with her after Epstein trafficked her to London, is pictured with the Duke of York in 2001In the November TV interview with the BBC, Andrew insisted he did not spend time with Giuffre at Tramp Nightclub in London on March 10, 2001, after which she claims the pair first had sex.The duke denied he slept with her on three separate occasions, saying the encounter in 2001 did not happen as he had taken his daughter Princess Beatrice to Pizza Express in Woking for a party, and they spent the rest of the day together. Giuffre has previously described their alleged time together in London in vivid detail, claiming that Andrew had been \u0027sweating\u0027 as they danced together in the London nightclub.  Andrew disputed that detail, saying he has a \u0027peculiar medical condition which is that I don\u0027t sweat or I didn\u0027t sweat at the time\u0027.He also said that her story didn\u0027t make sense because he didn\u0027t know where the bar in Tramp Nightclub is. \u0027I don\u0027t drink, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there,\u0027 he said.   Questioned about the photo of him and Giuffre together, which friends of the Duke have said could have been faked, Andrew said that public displays of affection are \u0027not something he would do\u0027 but refused to reveal whether he thought the image was doctored.He said: \u0027Oh it’s definitely me, I mean that\u0027s a picture of me. I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a picture of me in London because when I go out in London I wear a suit and a tie. \u0027That\u0027s what I would describe as my travelling clothes if I\u0027m going to go overseas. There’s plenty of photographs of me dressed in that sort of kit but not there.\u0027                 In a November TV interview, Andrew maintained that he does not recall meeting Giuffre US Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein, who killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The case brought renewed scrutiny to Epstein\u0027s many high-profile associates, including Andrew, who says he met the financier in 1999. The pair maintained their friendship even after Epstein served 13 months in a Florida county jail after pleading guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution in 2008. Andrew came under fire in 2010 after it was revealed that he stayed at Epstein\u0027s Manhattan home following his release from jail.     Asked during the November interview whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, Andrew said: \u0027Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.\u0027 The BBC interviewer replied: \u0027Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u0027Andrew then apologized, saying: \u0027I\u0027m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender. \u0027But no, was I right in having him as a friend? At the time, bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender. \u0027I don\u0027t there was anything wrong then, the problem was the fact that once he had been convicted I stayed with him and that’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u0027 Andrew was also friends with Maxwell, the British socialite accused in several civil lawsuits of recruiting girls and young women for Epstein to sexually abuse.Last week, a former police protection officer for Andrew came forward to claim that Maxwell would visit the prince at Buckingham Palace up to four times a day and that the pair would enjoy picnics together on the grounds of the estate in London. Met Police officer Paul Page, who worked for the Royals from 1998 to 2004, told The Mirror he first became aware of who Maxwell was in 2001 when the privy purse - the office that handles the Queen\u0027s private income - called to inform him that a guest was coming to see Andrew but that the name was not to be entered into the book. \u0027She turned up in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover and we let her in. Half an hour after that me and my colleague walked through the garden to go back to the police lodge and he was having a picnic with her by the summer house, opposite the Queen\u0027s ­bedroom window,\u0027 Page said.\u0027One of my colleagues saw her come in and out the Palace four times in one day.\u0027 Andrew claimed in the BBC interview that he last saw Maxwell in the early spring of last year, months before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges.  Maxwell has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein but is believed to be one of the key figures in the US government\u0027s probe. Two guards who were supposed to be monitoring Epstein the night he was found dead have already been charged with falsifying the jail\u0027s log books to indicate they were performing checks on prisoners, when they were actually sleeping or browsing the internet.  Prince Andrew \u0027had visits from Ghislaine Maxwell 4 times a day\u0027 says ex-protection officer - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle explains public fell sister Meghan","story":"Share this article \u0027Clearly there were some things that happened because the public\u0027s not stupid.\u0027They were witnessing some things that they didn\u0027t think were so cool and she didn\u0027t step up to the plate and fix them.\u0027That includes family, that includes public spending, there was a lot that happened that was attributable to behaviour.\u0027It wasn\u0027t about racism, it was about hey you guys aren\u0027t being cool step up to the plate and fix it.\u0027Samantha, who is twice orced and suffers multiple sclerosis, has been estranged from Meghan for more than a decade and was not invited to the royal wedding.          Samantha Markle, who shares Meghan\u0027s father Thomas (pictured), said it her behaviour that meant Meghan fell out of favour with the public Asked if there was any chance of her reuniting with her sister, she said: \u0027I didn\u0027t feel that\u0027s possible given that there was so much malice, there was so much attacking when it could have been nipped in the bud and we could be playing footsies under the table.\u0027She said she hopes Meghan and their father Thomas, 75, can reconcile before he dies.\u0027He was almost a single dad to her her whole life, gave her everything.

Normally on road trips your eyes are peeled onto the road and its so physically and mentally exhausting that it is tiring. Here, I am looking around at some pretty trees and enjoying the ride,\u0027 he said.Ryan felt the recharging stops actually made the trip more fun rather than just stopping at a regular gas stations only to get back on the road, as would be the case in a regular gas fueled vehicle.After 20 hours of driving, Ryan had traveled 956 miles and was still some distance away from the Windy City.He notes that despite the car saying a single charge would last for 270 miles, each time he \u0027filled up\u0027, after about 200 miles the battery power began to dwindle.         Ryan says charging stations, pictured, need to be located next to the highway like gas because otherwise drivers need to deviate from their route adding time and mileage to the journey         Ryan said he felt as though he was was a passenger along for the ride and enjoyed the trip\u0027Overall its a good experience and feels like I\u0027m a passenger in an airplane with everyone having their own seat,\u0027 he said in an 18-minute long YouTube video.Eventually, after several more charging station stops and another 250 miles later, Ryan reached Chicago having driven for 28 hours in total with around 7½ hours dedicated to charging the vehicle.By the time he arrived in Chicago after travelling 1,236 miles, it had been almost 36 hours since leaving Austin.Ryan took time to sum up the experience explaining the positives and negatives of the whole journey.         He said wouldn\u0027t do something similar until electric cars become more popular with longer battery life and more places to charge up\u0027The cost was free! It cost us zero dollars to cross the country. I put a couple of thousand miles on the car which will depreciate its value but there were no out-of-pocket costs,\u0027 he boasted. Ryan noted that one of the more frustrating aspects of the trip was having to charge the car so many times. The superchargers are often located 5-10 miles away from the highway and added a significant amount of time to the trip.Ryan said that he felt the Autopilot was great on a long road trip because he was able to look around and not feel so mentally exhausted by having to keep his eyes on the road at all times.However, he said that he would never make such a long road trip in the car again because of the overall amount of time spent charging which added a significant amount of time and mileage to the overall journey."},{"url":null,"title":"Youll nut nearer squirrel this","story":"Share this article          \u0027I like to take pictures with a lot of emotions in them, and I find that it\u0027s easy to pretend that squirrels are little humans in fur costumes,\u0027 he said \u0027It\u0027s like a Disney version of nature photography, I don\u0027t want to add toys or trinkets, I prefer pictures where they have expressions that makes you think you know what they feel.\u0027Squirrels don\u0027t hobnob with other squirrels, except when very young, they don\u0027t care for anyone eating their food really.\u0027I don\u0027t spend a lot of time on the captions, I just try to open up my mind and see what comes to me, most of the time a lyric from an old song.\u0027Occasionally, I come up with a really funny one, and when I do, I\u0027m prouder of the caption than the picture.

At the inquiry into the October 1999 Ladbroke Grove rail crash, which saw 31 people killed, the Attorney General agreed not to prosecute based on evidence given at the hearing to ensure the whole truth was heard.  It comes after the inquiry heard that certain key firms which revamped the high-rise block appeared to know two years before the disaster that a planned cladding system would fail if exposed to fire, according to internal emails disclosed on Tuesday.Scotland Yard said in September that it had completed 17 interviews under caution in its investigation into the fire regarding gross negligence manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and health and safety offences, and said \u0027the number will continue to increase\u0027.  Sir Martin said the development had caused him a \u0027little surprise\u0027 as \u0027hitherto there has been the fullest co-operation with the inquiry\u0027.

This council could have done and should have done more to stop it happening.\u0027  Listing failings of the organisation, Mr Maxwell Scott said it \u0027failed to ask for comprehensive details on the cladding system including the crown\u0027 and failed to identify that the insulation materials used in the cladding system were not of limited combustibility.He added: \u0027Building control failed to recognise that insufficient or no cavity barriers to seal the cavities at openings within the walls, including around the windows, had been indicated on the plans submitted to it.\u0027Building control did not have a formal procedure for tracking the progress of applications for building control approval ... had one been in place, it would have reduced the likelihood of aspects of the application or the building control approval process being overlooked.\u0027He said it should not have issued a completion certificate on July 7 2016.In a statement, Grenfell United said: \u0027There is no confession here, barely any honesty and certainly no true remorse.\u0027They have no choice but to accept that it was a total failure for their building control to sign off the refurbishment.\u0027They have not opened up about all the other ways they were disturbingly reckless in the project from start to finish and how they treated us before and after the fire.\u0027It is insulting to us that they are trying to argue that despite signing off a building that was a death trap they should not share any responsibility for it.\u0027This argument makes them no better than all the companies we have heard this week, passing the buck and minimising their own role in the disaster.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Tate Britain advertises Head Coffee 39 500 salary offering 26 959 curators","story":"Share this article          The advertisement for the Assistant Exhibition Registrar role was posted directly underneath the Head of Coffee roleCandidates are also required to have a knowledge of international museum standards regarding the transport of fine art.The gallery looks after a range of pieces from artists from across the world and last year was home to some of the most famous Van Gogh pieces.Pieces from the artist have previously been sold for more than £60 million, and the curator would be responsible for making sure various pieces were packaged correctly to be transported.The candidate would also need \u0027excellent\u0027 written and verbal communication skills as well as internal and external contacts.A high degree of computer literacy is also required for the role, as well as the ability to deal with figures and budget planning.   This is while to apply for the role of Head of Coffee, you would need \u0027experience and contacts in the coffee industry\u0027 as well as \u0027extensive experience of cupping and espresso quality assessment.\u0027Other requirements state the candidate would need a successful track record of business development, sales and strategy, as well as experience in developing blends for espresso and filter coffee.It does seem however that the role would be extremely varied, as the candidate also needs to have a proven track record in training people as well as experience in financial management.    MailOnline has contacted the Tate. "},{"url":null,"title":"Pub bans men wearing jobby catcher tracksuits flip flops bearing mankles","story":"Share this article \u0027It may seem trivial but there was that jeans halfway down the ar** trend a few years ago and it went unchecked to the point that we had a lad sitting at the bar with his strides basically round his ankles, displaying a massive skidmark up the back of his threadbare shreddies.\u0027If you\u0027re going to base your fashion choices on what the staff at Urban Outfitters were wearing, there\u0027s a place created especially for you.

We know that on that voyage something happened because she delivered a mayday message early December saying she\u0027s in distress.\u0027And then that was it. They never found any wreckage. They never found any lifeboats, bodies or anything. The vessel just disappeared after that point. So we\u0027ve been trying to determine what happened.\u0027         The ship had sent out wireless distress signals on December 1, 1925, two days after it left Charleston but it has only now just been found (pictured, ers examine the wreck)To help pinpoint the possible location where the SS Cotopaxi sunk, Barnette contacted British historian Guy Walters to help do some digging. Walters combed through ship records at the archives of Lloyd\u0027s of London, who were the insurance brokers of the SS Cotopaxi. There he discovered something previously unknown about the SS Cotopaxi\u0027s voyage. The ship had sent out wireless distress signals on December 1, 1925, two days after it left Charleston. The signals were picked up in Jacksonville, Florida, placing the ship in the area of a shipwreck found nearly 35 years ago.Armed with this new information, Barnette headed to Florida with his e partner, Joe Citelli, to e the wreck. However, their e as well as the use of an underwater drone to survey the ship, did not produce any corroborating evidence.          The ship is one of the triangle\u0027s biggest secrets and even popped up at the end of Steven Spielberg\u0027s 1977 blockbuster, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where it was found in the Gobi Dessert having supposedly been placed there by aliens         Their research and findings will be revealed in the premiere episode of the new Science Channel series, Shipwreck Secrets, premiering Sunday, February 9 (pictured, a grab from the show)From there, Barnette met with Al Perkins, an avid er who has been ing the area since the 1980\u0027s.

Together they headed to the wreck - and what they found was truly astonishing.Further research was able to corroborate the wreck\u0027s location compared to where the distress signals were sent out, leading Barnette to come to no other conclusion: they\u0027ve uncovered the long-lost SS Cotopaxi.Shipwreck Secrets then visited with Douglas Myers in Long Island, NY, the grandson the SS Cotopaxi Captain William J.

Get yourself to Ghent!According to the Italian art critic Giorgio Vasari, writing hundreds of miles away and more than a century later, the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck “delighted in alchemy”. As he mixed up compounds by candlelight in a workshop by a canal in Bruges, he hit on the secret of oil painting. There’s no proof of any of this – but as you look at his uncannily perfect paintings in the epochal new survey of his genius at Ghent’s Museum of Fine Arts, it’s easy to believe he dabbled in magic.The proof twinkles between the thumb and index finger of Jan de Leeuw, in Van Eyck’s 1436 portrait of this fellow craftsman. De Leeuw was a leading Bruges goldsmith and, as he fixes a sharp, clear gaze straight at you, he holds a ring he has made. It’s as much rivalry as homage. The jeweller’s art is intricate, but painting is something else. The ring glints in dazzles of yellow, catching a beam of light. The goldsmith made a reflective object, but Van Eyck has made the light itself.Making gold from base metal was the alchemist’s dream. Here – in this show at Ghent Museum of Fine Arts, which accompanies the restoration of the Ghent Altarpiece at nearby St Bavo’s Cathedral – Van Eyck makes it from pigments, a trick he performs in ever more spectacular ways like a magician impressing the Duke of Burgundy, for whom he worked as court artist, or doing tricks in the market squares of Bruges and Ghent.It’s not just gold he can magic into being. In his Annunciation, lent by Washington DC’s National Gallery of Art, the angel Gabriel is bedecked in pearls, rubies and sapphires that are hypnotically solid. The words Gabriel speaks are written in gold in the air. Behind Mary, bottle-glass windows shimmer with light. It’s impossible to resist bending forward to look deeper into the painting’s space. But wait a moment. This is a flat piece of wood with paint on it – not a real room. One thing isn’t really further away than another, it’s all just an illusion.Van Eyck is a magician all right, and he’s no easier to fathom today than when medieval folk gathered to gawp at his latest impossible creation. One of his favourite feats is to depict stone sculpture, stiller and colder than stone itself – as in his Annunciation Diptych, lent by the Thyssen Museum in Madrid. It works because Van Eyck simulates light hitting the surface of pure white marble and convincingly makes the statues seem three-dimensional, even catching reflections of their far sides in a polished background – and yet, these statues also appear alive. The dove of the holy spirit flies above Mary – but it, too, is stone. Van Eyck is truly showing off his sorcery.This might all seem like random brilliance, with no guiding beliefs about art and its purpose – except that he left a manifesto for his vision. Van Eyck is thought to have trained as a miniaturist, painting tiny, precise pictures in handwritten manuscripts. You can see, in his portrait of the courtier Baudouin de Lannoy, with his mossy silver stubble over a creased hunk of a face, how he transferred that close eye to portraiture. He was sent on a mission with De Lannoy to portray Isabella of Portugal, so Philip of Burgundy could see his prospective bride – which suggests the court valued him as a kind of photographer before photography. But Van Eyck had grander ideas. You can’t read them in a book. Instead you have to go to St Bavo’s Cathedral to see the Ghent altarpiece.This mesmerising exhibition celebrates a crucial step in the restoration of the altarpiece, which Van Eyck completed in 1432, six years after his initial collaborator, his brother Hubert, died. Since 2012, the Ghent Museum of Fine Arts has been restoring it, carefully and scientifically, stage by stage. Now the most famous section, the Adoration of the Lamb, has gone back on view after being returned to its original colours and details.Later re-paintings and mustard-coloured varnish are gone. The acid-blue intensity of the sky and emerald green of the landscape have been set free. Everything is so clear and sharp, now we see it as Van Eyck painted it. The fabulous buildings of his imagined Jerusalem display their geometries, while African and Middle Eastern trees reveal prickles and spikes. Holy processions and angelic hosts gather to revere the Lamb, their faces as wrinkled and characterful as any of his portraits. It’s a painting that pounds with life.And this is just one part. Meanwhile, other panels have been moved to the exhibition – and these are the true reason to get yourself to Ghent. It can be frustrating to see a “destination” artwork. You book your timed ticket to get a jostled experience of a remote icon. But the Museum of Fine Arts has opened up Ghent’s treasure for a proper look. Adam and Eve, two near life-sized nudes from the altarpiece, are in the show to ogle up close. And they’re stunning. Both have wiry tangles of pubic hair overflowing their fig leaves. These thin, dark filaments float over butter-gold flesh with 3D reality.It might be a confession. The truth of the human body matters just as much to him as a mystic lamb. The real meaning of the Ghent altarpiece, for its creator, is not religious. It’s about art. Michelangelo would be accused, much later, of glorifying his own art in the Sistine Chapel, instead of God. What Van Eyck does, too, is to declare the freedom of art – and the godlike power of painting. He shows on a stupendous scale that painting can remake worlds. In one panel, a window is open on to a blue, bird-filled sky above a medieval street, where people are chatting as they did 600 years ago. Jan van Eyck has preserved this moment by an act of wizardry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1bc8484bde0f67357a5494457cd34d2f15fc43/0_0_4573_3049/master/4573.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e4a1e8d8b551ebd9fdb713f4ceb47e 700w","title":"dust bowl wanderer in pictures wright morris","story":"Wright Morris was known for his novels, yet the pictures he took while travelling through the midwest capture a vanishing way of life in Depression-era America "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/124845cb12cd95e2732f44ffa50187218f8c2833/432_158_2929_1758/master/2929.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=544cba0a864fc2ecfa095f2d10ba2e64","title":"northern rail franchise to be renationalised","story":"Decision by transport secretary, Grant Shapps, comes after years of cancellations and delaysThe Northern rail franchise is to be renationalised, the government has announced, with the state operator of last resort taking over the running of the struggling network from 1 March.The decision by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, will be welcomed in the north after years of widespread cancellations and delays for passengers.The Northern franchise has been run by Arriva since 2016 but the operator’s ambitious plans to modernise and expand train services have given way to a grim reality of worsening punctuality and reliability, and a failure to achieve promised improvements.In a written ministerial statement, Shapps said: “This is a new beginning but it is only a beginning. Northern’s network is huge and complex and some of the things that are wrong are not going to be quick or easy to put right.”He said a cross-industry rail taskforce would be set up to help the north-west’s railways recover, while the new state operator would produce a masterplan of local infrastructure improvements needed to help services run smoothly.Shapps announced earlier in January that Northern’s finances meant that the current franchise arrangement could only last months and he was considering the best option for the taxpayer and passengers. However, he decided against accepting proposals from Arriva for a short-term management contract, which northern transport authorities had described as a “reward for failure”.Northern argues that many of the factors were out of control, such as postponed infrastructure upgrades that affected the rollout of more electric trains, leading to the prolonged retention of the infamous Pacer trains. Meanwhile, a long-running dispute with the RMT union led to widespread strikes.The decision means that the Conservatives have nationalised two major rail franchises in less than two years, after taking over the East Coast line in June 2018, now run as LNER after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast. Shapps last week admitted that the future of another, South West Railway, was in doubt, after the First Group-MTR joint venture said it was running out of cash. Questions also hang over the TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains franchises.Shapps admitted that the privatised model was not working, saying: “We know change is needed, and change is coming.”Renationalisation is unlikely to have immediate implications for staff or the travelling public. Virtually all employees are likely to be retained – at LNER, even the management team from Virgin remained in place – and operational problems will persist. However, the decision will be more palatable to unions, northern politicians and passengers, who have demanded action to improve services.Unions warned that Northern would need “significant investment” to turn it round. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: “We welcome today’s decision because we want the railway in public ownership but let’s do it properly, with a clear, long-term, strategic vision, not just as a short-term response to the years of franchised failure.“There won’t be an immediate improvement because many of the systemic failures at Northern cannot be remedied overnight.”The RMT predicted the decision would “open the floodgates” for other franchises to be taken in to the public sector. Mick Cash, general secretary, said it should not be a short-term fix: “This has to be a permanent move followed up with the investment and planning needed to deliver the rail services that passengers deserve after years of privatised chaos.”A root-and-branch review of the rail industry, which will recommend replacing the current system of franchising, has been completed by the former British Airways boss Keith Williams but is yet to be published by the Department for Transport.Northern is the biggest franchise in the country by the length of its route network and serves more than 500 stations in England north of Derby. It also receives the biggest state subsidy for its operations, running at £763m last year, including indirect funding for track access.Passengers in Manchester had few good words to say for Northern but were mixed in their view of whether nationalisation would help.Simon Kendall, 45, a freelance IT consultant, said his 30-minute commute from Littleborough to Salford Central is often “nothing but appalling”, with trains often delayed, cancelled or overcrowded, with fewer carriages than usual. “I was on a train last year and rain was coming in through the roof, and newspapers were used to mop up the water.”However, he said: “I’m not sure whether public ownership will work unless they decide to invest in the infrastructure. Northern rail has had no real investment for years and it’s a service that is used heavily by the public. Why spend money on HS2 when it’s the local rail networks that really need investment? Northern transport has been neglected for far too long.”Ursula Katz, 75, who travels three times a week from Hebden Bridge into Manchester to look after her grandchildren, said her service was often delayed or cancelled, especially at weekends: “The trains only run hourly and then they’ll cancel it and you have to wait an hour for the next one, and then it’s standing only.”She said: “I’m all for nationalisation of the trains. These franchises make life difficult for commuters, profit a lot and don’t reinvest. I hope that nationalising will make things better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0e00ee2867e804dede863ad808db2f61b1d7f6/0_34_3207_1924/master/3207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5454037d717811aec3cf64e1e7367de","title":"climate targets committee on climate change report","story":"Setting targets for climate action sounds sensible, but is actually impeding progress. There’s a different approach: maximisationThe crisis is not imminent. The crisis is here. The recent infernos in Australia the storms and floods in Brazil, Madagascar, Spain and the US and the economic collapse in Somalia, caused in part by a devastating cycle of droughts and floods, are not, or not only, a vision of the future. They are signs of a current and escalating catastrophe.This is why several governments and parliaments, the UK’s among them, have declared a climate emergency. But no one in government acts as if it is real. They operate within the old world of incremental planning for a disaster that has yet to arrive.Nowhere is this clearer than in the reports of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the official body that began with such hope and promise of holding the government to account, but that now seems to have abandoned scientific realities in favour of political priorities.The report makes no mention of rewilding or natural regeneration. The only means it proposes by which trees should return to the land is planting. This is often a slower, more expensive and less effective way of restoring habitats and sucking carbon out of the atmosphere than removing livestock or controlling deer numbers and allowing trees to return by themselves. Its target for reforestation is so feeble that the UK would still have less than half the average current European forest cover by 2050.One of the reasons for this timidity is its preposterous assumption that if land is unsuitable for commercial forestry, it’s unsuitable for trees. There are plenty of places where trees grow well, store carbon and provide magnificent habitats, but won’t produce straight 50-foot poles. The CCC envisages not wild woods, but plantations, whose purpose is the discredited policy of “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage”.This means growing wood to burn in power stations, then capturing and burying the carbon emissions. It is likely to cause more harm than good. Could the committee’s enthusiasm have anything to do with the fact that one of its members works for Drax, the energy company pioneering this disastrous technology? Throughout the report, business appears to come first nature and climate last.All this, the CCC says, is consistent with the target it has set for the government, of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It tells me that the rationale for this target “remains valid today”, meeting the UK’s obligations under the Paris agreement. This agreement commits governments to seek “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels”.But I think the problem runs deeper than this. It’s not just the target that’s wrong, but the very notion of setting targets in an emergency.When firefighters arrive at a burning building, they don’t set themselves a target of rescuing three of the five inhabitants. They seek – aware that they may not succeed – to rescue everyone they can. Their aim is to maximise the number of lives they save. In the climate emergency, our aim should be to maximise both the reduction of emissions and the drawing down of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. There is no safe level of global heating: every increment kills.Maximisation is implicit in the Paris agreement: it requires governments to pursue “the highest possible ambition”. In its land-use report, the CCC repeatedly admits that it could go further, but insists it doesn’t need to, because its policies will meet the target. The target has supplanted the ultimate objective, which is to respond appropriately to the climate emergency. This is a classic vindication of Goodhart’s law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”We are all familiar with the absurdities of target culture. We know how, in many workplaces, the target becomes the task. We know how official targets for depriving people of social security ruined thousands of lives. We know that the Windrush scandal – the persecution and wrongful deportation of people legally entitled to reside in the UK – was caused in part by the Home Office target for “enforced returns”. We know how targets encourage people to game the system, as hospital administrators do with their waiting lists, and cause Kafkaesque nightmares of overzealous officialdom, as David Boyle documents in his new book, Tickbox.But less discussed is the way in which targets can encourage officials to underperform. As soon as you set a target, you pull back from maximisation. Even if you say “this target is the minimum”, as the CCC does, politicians treat it as merely the line they need to cross. At this point, they fulfil their legal duty, even if they fail to fulfil their wider duty of care.Is a policy of maximisation possible? It is not only possible, it’s already happening, in exactly the wrong place. The 2015 Infrastructure Act introduced a legal duty to “maximise the economic recovery” of petroleum in the UK. If drilling companies fail to maximise their extraction of fossil fuel from an oilfield, they will be forced to surrender their licence to operate. In other words, while the government observes a legal minimum (the CCC’s target) for reducing greenhouse gases, it observes a legal maximum for increasing them.The appropriate response to the climate emergency is a legal duty to maximise climate action. The CCC’s board should be disbanded and replaced by people whose mandate is rigorously to explore every economic sector in search of the maximum possible cuts in greenhouse gases, and the maximum possible drawdown. We have arrived at the burning building. The only humane and reasonable aim is to rescue everyone inside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3f2febc7fadc0a08ac19e54570d26943ec67be3/628_194_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dea4064369f7cf04178673d5b8d8dad","title":"i love my dog but why must walkies involve horrendous social interactions","story":"Dog people report reduced feelings of social isolation, partly because of all the walks with all the other dog owners.

It’s even harder to dodge a dog bore than a colleague who shares your commute.I tallied seven social interactions on today’s walk: three hellos and four chats (it’s cold, our dogs are idiots, watch out for the grumpy husky, and, unusually, a compliment on my coat). I realise that sounds perfectly pleasant, and I know it’s good for me: research on “weak-ties” and stranger interactions consistently shows these contacts enhance mood. But what I crave on our morning walk is an hour alone with the birdsong, the murderous honking of the local geese and the sluggish churn of my thoughts. I should have got a cat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82cfed18a7fb6dc5559c260a1064c4c6e769ae04/0_396_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faad27968329beb9733b16464ef7366d","title":"saudi arabia iran regime survive us standoff","story":"For all its fiery rhetoric, Riyadh actually benefits from a standoff between Iran and the USIn a video animation released in December 2017 the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, oversees an invasion of Iran after Iranian boats attack a Saudi humanitarian ship. At the end of the video, Saudi troops storm a military compound where a haggard, trembling Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds force, surrenders on his knees. The video, created by an outfit calling itself Saudi Strike Force, was produced in multiple languages including Mandarin and has been viewed more than 1.5m times.In real life, Suleimani is now dead, killed not by the Saudis but in a US strike on 3 January outside Baghdad airport, having just returned from Lebanon and Syria on one of his many missions as the architect of Iran’s regional power base.Saudis on Twitter were gleeful and official Saudi media were jubilant, declaring in al-Riyadh newspaper that a new decade had started for the region as Iran’s dark shadow receded. If Saudi officials celebrated, they did so quietly, relieved Suleimani was dead, and even more relieved they didn’t have to do it themselves, but wary of Iranian retaliation. There were calls for quick de-escalation, and within three days the crown prince’s brother and deputy minister of defence, Khalid bin Salman, travelled to Washington DC for meetings at the White House.This pattern of clamouring for tough action against Iran and then calling for de-escalation has characterised the Saudi-Iran rivalry since the Iranian revolution of 1979. That year is remembered mostly as the moment when Iran and the US became enemies in the wake of the US embassy hostage crisis in November. But the relationship between Tehran and Riyadh was also transformed. The two countries, once friendly rivals and pillars of US efforts to contain Soviet influence in the region, became enemies when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the ultimate leader of the revolution, began to challenge the Saudis in their role as leaders of the Muslim world and custodians of the two holy sites of Islam, Mecca and Medina.The rivalry has become an intrinsic part of US-Iran enmity over the past 40 years, creating a threesome in which Saudi Arabia plays the role of indispensable counterweight to Tehran. But Saudi Arabia both thrives off this state of affairs and feeds it. As much as the kingdom fears Iran, its status as America’s special friend in the region has become tied to the continuation of the regime in Tehran.This explains why Riyadh was so angry with Barack Obama for pursuing detente with Iran, worried it would undermine its own place in the region. This dependence has become even more important at a time when the US-Saudi relationship is fraught with tensions over the alleged hacking of Amazon president Jeff Bezos’s phone by bin Salman and the killing of the Washington Post columnist and Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. All of Saudi Arabia’s faults and excesses seem to be excused as long as the Trump administration is focused on pressuring Iran.But Saudi Arabia now finds itself with a conundrum. The kingdom wants Iran beaten up but not broken, and it relies on others to do the job because it is not up to the task – not militarily and not from a strategic planning perspective. However, Saudi Arabia has found that the Trump administration may be a fickle friend when it comes to defending the kingdom in case of an Iranian attack, as happened in September 2019, when a suspected Iranian drone struck Saudi oil facilities. The US responded with a lot of heat but little fire: there was no US retaliation on behalf of Saudi Arabia. And though the Trump administration has since deployed thousands of additional troops to the kingdom, the Saudis still felt vulnerable. This is why, within a month of the attack on the Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities, the Saudis were exploring indirect talks with Iran, with the help of Iraq and Pakistan, to try to reduce tensions.After the killing of Suleimani, the Saudi calls for de-escalation fit the same pattern. Having watched with alarm as Iran expanded its influence in the region over the past few years, thanks in large parts to Suleimani, the kingdom will now be hoping there’s an opportunity for them: no matter how many of Suleimani’s stratagems have been institutionalised, his successor will not be as efficient. Is there room to engage with Shia leaders in Iraq who would like to distance themselves from Iran? Is this the moment to squeeze a compromise out of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran’s mostly successful proxy?The Iranian commander had become the young crown prince’s nemesis, one who in all probability inspired some jealousy and admiration for having achieved what bin Salman felt the kingdom has never quite mastered: a regional strategy that inspires both fear and respect with a solid network of loyal proxies and allies.The bombast of the 2017 animation, which showcases Saudi Arabia’s extensive and expensive military arsenal, reflects the fantasy that Prince Mohammed indulged in when he first rose to power between 2015 and 2017, trying his hand at an uncharacteristically muscular Saudi foreign policy as he launched wars and embargoes. The video starts with a sentence from an interview that Prince Mohammed gave to the Saudi state television, al-Ekhbariyya, in May 2017 during which he said: “We will not wait until the fight is in Saudi Arabia – we will bring the fight to Iran.”By now, the crown prince has been sobered somewhat by the realisation that his swagger has delivered nothing on the regional front except a devastating war in Yemen and a useless embargo on Qatar. Even worse, it was Iran that brought the war to Saudi Arabia with the Aramco attack.Now that the US is showing its teeth with the killing of Suleimani and more sanctions on Iran, Saudi Arabia may feel reassured, but it cannot be certain whether there is a new, coherent Trump policy or this is a one-off that will leave them exposed again the next time Iran lashes out.As protests continue in Iran and the Trump administration ramps up pressure on Tehran, choking it economically, talk of regime change or collapse is in the air again. Saudis are also watching with trepidation. At the end of the video animation, Saudi forces are welcomed as saviours in Tehran as citizens wave the Saudi flag – a fantasy if ever there was one. In real life, not only would Saudi troops be unwelcome in Iran, but actually the kingdom needs the current Iranian regime to survive.• Kim Ghattas is a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of Black Wave"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e673558729f189cc12156d90709f6cc765a0b6d5/0_83_5523_3314/master/5523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7807401a4723dbd4813f0352610cee61","title":"swimming wild trend social media cliche","story":"Don’t get me wrong, I love outdoor bathing – but I object to its appropriation by a privileged urban eliteThe romantic poets – Coleridge, Byron, Keats – loved to swim. Swimming in open water offered the opportunity to connect with nature, nourish creativity, garner spiritual inspiration and experience the sublime. Their obsession was called hydromania, and it’s back. “Wild swimming”, as it is now known, is growing in popularity across the UK. It is increasingly featured in the press and on social media, often coupled with intensely romantic language. In publishing, memoirs about swimming and its ability to heal addiction and mental health problems have become their own niche genre.This, together with a boom in nature writing, a new trend for “forest bathing”, a general obsession with going “off grid” and internet-free retreats, and the introduction of a new natural history GCSE, all seems to indicate an increased popular engagement with the natural world. Is this a response to the climate crisis and the pressures of modern living? It feels as though we are entering a new era of high romanticism, but unlike the past, the proponents of the trend – at least in the often twee fascination with it online and in the media – seem to be white, upper and middle class urban-dwelling women.I’ve never been a fan of the phrase “wild swimming” in Snowdonia, where I grew up, we always just called it swimming. To call it “wild”, I feel, is to centre the urban, the municipal and the populated, and to place the rural and the natural at the margins.I spent much of my childhood swimming outdoors, because we were spoiled for beautiful, clear, deep bodies of water, in the form of mountain lakes and river pools, quarry holes, waterfalls and lagoons. We thought nothing of it the idea of it being a “trend” would not have made sense to us. These days, social media is flooded with posed photos of attractive, middle class urbanites in natural lakes and rivers. To the many rural-dwelling Brits who prefer to swim in a natural setting, it must seem strange to see something that is simply a part of many people’s routines become an activity to show off about on social media. My friend’s nan has been swimming in Lake Windermere for decades. Now you can buy a Wordsworth-themed wild swimming package holiday and join her.I was bemused when my old local lake, Llyn Padarn, at the foot of Yr Wyddfa (or, if you must, Snowdon), popped up in a New Yorker article about the vogue for outdoor swimming, via an Observer piece recommending the best winter spots. Llyn Padarn is the last place we would have swum as teenagers – not especially clear and, back then, not very clean either, being as it is next to a sewage works. These days I’m told it has been cleaned up and, as it offers a free, family-friendly activity in a deprived area, is packed with people in the summer. There are even food trucks, and a resulting litter problem. Locals I know continue to keep the quieter, more beautiful swimming spots to themselves.Seeing my much-loved lake marketed back at me did lead me to wonder, perhaps ungenerously, whether this whole trend is being led by those who view the natural world as a cure-all in the midst of a capitalist-driven mental health epidemic. “It’s all incredibly elitist,” says Luke Turner, author of Out of the Woods, a memoir about love, sexuality, religion and nature. “Go for a wild swim or a forest bathe and you’ll be easily connected with nature and all your problems solved, your guilt at being part of the capitalist system causing climate change washed away.” Turner set out to write a nature cure book, but “it ended up being about how we need to dissolve this nonsensical idea that forest bathing or climbing or swimming or looking after a wild animal is some kind of universal means of solace, healing and redemption.”In London, the Hampstead Heath bathing ponds have become, for some at least, a sort of posh girl status signifier, as satirised by the hilarious Twitter account Bougie London Literary Woman. Now the ponds’ inclusion in a long New Yorker essay has cemented their cachet. As one of the few single-sex spaces in the city, the women’s pond has a special place in many hearts, including mine. It is particularly beloved by older and queer women, and there has been some beautiful writing about it, most notably in the Daunt Publishing collection At the Pond. But the flipside of this is that, in summer, it’s packed with people trying to take photos in the meadow where everyone sunbathes topless.My friend Nell Frizzell, who worked as a lifeguard at the women’s pond, points out that urban dwellers are more alienated from nature than perhaps ever before. “They travel to work on a bus, they sit at a computer all day, they live in a small flat with no garden, they buy their food in supermarkets, there are no trees on their street, they have never grown food, they do not recognise birdsong, they miss entire seasons,” she says. “We are not built to live that way. Of course we’re not. And so, I believe, a latent hunger for something – anything – that feels like the outdoors world pulls us to ponds, to rivers, to the sea.”Young women’s bodies are also among the most surveilled by capitalism, and to remove one’s body from its place as a perceived site of transaction and to dunk it in freezing cold water can feel rebellious and freeing. Yet 4 million people swim outdoors each year – people of all ages, shapes and sizes choose to do this, and groups such as Swim Dem Crew aim to make swimming more inclusive. The attractively posed shots are only part of the story.Even if some of the behaviour on social media is annoying, Frizzell says that, when undertaken regularly, outdoor swimming significantly improves your life, and I agree. It is certainly no miracle cure, but it can offer a kind of healing. A friend who swam in Llyn Padarn during her cancer treatment tells me that it was a way of remembering who she was. Amy Liptrot’s memoir of addiction, The Outrun, contains one of my favourite passages in literature about swimming. Liptrot writes: “By swimming in the sea I cross normal boundaries. I’m no longer on land but part of a body of water making up all the oceans of the world, which moves, ebbing and flowing under and around me. Naked on the beach, I am a selkie slipped from its skin.”This passage suggests that sea swimming results in feelings of communality, of living in the world much-needed sensations for those alienated under capitalism. It seems clear that the climate crisis is part of the picture, even if unconsciously. It has brought about a need to recuperate the nature that has been so neglected, to take stock of it and make the most of it while it is still here. It’s a way of communing with a planet that is dying, of feeling part of the whole.I wonder what the historians of the future will make of this vogue for throwing ourselves into the water, then writing about it. Are we swimming while Rome burns, projecting our own 21st century narcissism on to a natural world we’ve treated with contempt? Or are we waking up to what really matters? And is it all too little, too late?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a42a2299a6b44456b74732a4d05bedfced62e0/0_0_4979_2987/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cfb1b6381e9a863be1c3e8e9cd91124","title":"teachers tell us if you think the planned pay rise is enough","story":"If you are a teacher working in England we would like to hear your thoughts on salaries in the profession In light of the government announcing plans to raise salaries for teachers in England, we’d like to find out whether this measure is enough to stop teachers leaving the profession.

He also called on universities to review the increasing number of international students, rather than “deny places to UK students based on their class”.Since the lifting of the student admissions cap in 2015, the number of places at many universities has grown exponentially, but undergraduate numbers have remained relatively stable at Oxford and Cambridge, though both claim to have made significant progress in ersifying their student body.The OfS report, Transforming Opportunity in Higher Education, details ambitious commitments by universities to improve equality of opportunity for students. Currently, young people from advantaged areas of England are more than six times as likely to attend selective universities, including Oxford, Cambridge and other members of the Russell Group, as those from disadvantaged areas.Buchanan said the HMC was confident their students would continue to secure places at prestigious universities at home and overseas, thanks to excellent results and soft skills. “However, care is needed in starting actively to discriminate against inidual young people on the basis of the class they were born into. The country needs all its young people to reach their potential if we are to create a bright new future for Britain post-Brexit.”Buchanan said contextual admissions – which allow universities to take into account an applicant’s educational and socio-economic background – were reasonable “if used on a sophisticated, inidual basis”, but it should not be about school type.“Independent schools play an important role in getting disadvantaged students into university through offering free and discounted places. Not all state-educated students are disadvantaged and the majority of students from affluent backgrounds are not educated in HMC schools. This is why a sophisticated approach is needed for the country genuinely to level up.”Kalwant Bhopal, a professor of education and justice at Birmingham University, said: “It is clear that those students who attend independent fee-paying schools are more likely to be white and middle-class and are more likely to go on to hold top high-earning jobs. These schools continue to perpetuate privilege. Contextual admissions are one small step to addressing inequalities of opportunity facing children from many working-class, and black and ethnic minority families.”Chris Millward, the OfS director of fair access and participation, said if universities did not increase student numbers, then groups that were currently highly represented would end up being less represented as a result of the new targets.“We expect providers to work towards these targets because they tackle two urgent priorities: the need to open up all of our universities to people from those communities where progress into higher education is lowest, and to ensure that every student has the same chance to succeed once they get there.”The universities minister, Chris Skidmore, said it was damning that such large gaps still remained between disadvantaged students and their peers. “I am pleased to see universities being ambitious in their plans to reach out to those from disadvantaged backgrounds and to support them through their studies. But for universities which do not meet their registration conditions, I fully support the OfS to take appropriate action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/986230290d22a42ad28eb91413e4ccde3c60f3e4/0_96_2947_1768/master/2947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=593ee158a8ffb7de95e15c3ea3434cc4","title":"more affordable housing should be built in national parks","story":"Carl Lis OBE, chair of National Parks England, warns young people being priced out of scenic areasMore affordable housing should be built in England’s national parks to help communities excluded by spiralling prices driven by second homes, the new chair for the authorities has said.Carl Lis OBE, chair of National Parks England, has warned that young people and national parks staff are being forced out of some of the most scenic parts of the country by high prices, driven in part by exclusive holiday homes.In an interview with the , Lis said the government should also take action on “land banking” by developers in protected areas such as the Lake District, the South Downs and the Peak District, so-called because property speculators hoard plots with planning permission for years to maximise profits.Lis, who is also chair of the Yorkshire Dales authority, said more should be done to attract people from a range of backgrounds to England’s most beautiful areas after a government-commissioned report warned visitors to parks are “exclusive, mainly white, mainly middle‑class club”.“When you couple that with the fact that young people can’t afford to live in the park at my authority in the dales … our employees that work with us can’t afford to live in the national park … The obvious solution is to build more affordable homes.”House prices in some English national parks are more than double the regional average, according to research by Hamptons International. The average house price in the New Forest is £622,670 in the past year, often pricing out young families and the park workers.Lis was behind a proposal in the Yorkshire Dales to increase tax on second homes fivefold, although it was opposed by the local district council.Lis said more needed to be done to aid the development of genuinely affordable housing in national parks, calling on the government to stop property developers land banking and ensure homes get built once planning permission is given.“In terms of houses, I think what is important is the situation as far as developers just being able to hang on to land with planning for permission as long as they can,” he added.Last year, a government-commissioned report led by the writer Julian Glover into the future of Britain’s protected landscapes, criticised national parks for not doing enough to make people welcome. Lis said parks would do more to attract a wider range of visitors.“We need to be attractive to every single part of our population. The national parks are the breathing spaces where people can benefit from peace and tranquility. The pure beauty of landscapes. It’s incumbent on us, as our second purpose of the authority, that we encourage all people to come and visit.”Despite the aim of attracting a more erse array of visitors, the head of the Lake District national park authority was accused of using the issue to push through commercial development schemes which could jeopardise its Unesco world heritage status.Earlier this month, plans to moor holiday boats on the shores of Grasmere in the Lake District national park were withdrawn after thousands of protesters planned to oppose the proposals. The park is also facing a judicial review over its refusal to ban 4x4s and motorbikes amid concerns it was ruining the tranquility of the area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c34b5181ed07ebd070176503241494006e80859/94_239_1403_842/master/1403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cda8a15c5ac124e069079db4c9e9bccc","title":"jak zostalem gansterem historia prawdziwa review polish gangster film","story":"Based on real events, this story of Polish gangsters fighting each other and abusing women is self-important and cliche-riddenThe Polish cinema industry likes churning out gangster movies, rather like our own film business in the Uncool Britannia era of the late 90searly noughties.

What we used to think of as “the football club”, if that isn’t going back too far to make sense in this day and age.Happily, the Saudi regime are not the only ones whose priorities are somewhat out of whack. Only last week, I was marvelling at the point-missing evident in a newspaper headline announcing that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had “TAUNTED JEFF BEZOS WITH A SEXIST MEME”. Ooh, then now he’s REALLY gone too far. Yet within mere days, that headline’s football equivalent has presented itself, with a warning that “TV piracy row could hit Newcastle takeover bid”. Well, 134 crucifixions between January and September last year … but I guess we found it. TV piracy: the last taboo.Yes, according to reports, Saudi Arabia’s alleged bid for Newcastle United could meet opposition from the Premier League over its involvement in alleged state-sponsored piracy. My mind’s eye immediately spools forward to the moment a week or so hence, where a regretful-looking Sky Sports reporter will stand outside St James’ Park and say: “Whilst the Premier League was OK with the beheadings and the dismemberment, Jim, this dodgy feed stuff has ultimately proved the deal breaker.”The pirate outfit in question is BeoutQ, which has lifted content from the Qatar-based Bein Sports, as part of Saudi Arabia’s ongoing and multi-pronged economic conflict with its fellow Gulf state. The European Commission has been on the case of Saudi state involvement in this piracy, after rights holders including the Premier League and La Liga lodged a complaint about what they see as simple theft. This week the EC reported back, accusing Saudi Arabia of “causing considerable harm to EU businesses”. The latter is thought by some to be quite the blot on the Saudi copybook.All we are told this time is that Ashley has let it be known he is furious at the leak at this delicate stage of negotations, and is “demanding answers”, which certainly sounds cheaper than demanding strikers, or left-backs. There is also a suggestion that Mike is in talks with two bidders besides the Saudis – suggesting he has been the highly unfortunate victim of a triple leak. Honestly, what are the chances?Against this questionable backdrop, then, it is arguably the off-the-record comments from the Premier League which are more intriguing, with one anonymous source saying a Saudi takeover would present an “interesting challenge”. I enjoyed that euphemism, as though we were talking about an intermediate-level sudoku, or the problem of how to dispose of a journalist within an embassy using low-fi surgical instruments.Even when the test is actually failed, it has often proved no bar on the unfit or improper. Back in 2010, the Blackpool owner Owen Oyston failed it on account of a rape conviction, and was duly instructed to dispose of his majority shareholding in the club. He did no such thing, though the Premier League apparently vaguely thought he had complied. Oyston used the subsequent years to indulge in what a high court judge called “illegitimate stripping” of the club.In 2017, the Saudi consortium will already know, the Premier League updated their owners and director’s test to take in the notion of “conduct outside the United Kingdom that would constitute an offence”. Well now. Where do you start? And, indeed, where do you end? Either way, testing times for the poor little test could lie ahead, and you certainly wouldn’t trust Ashley not to force English football to take in even more dirty washing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a2ce6b36832ba0073e274e1d304d9c799009550/0_162_3733_2239/master/3733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2afc771b1eb699334494320c9d27168b","title":"dream job what happened next","story":"Caretaker on a remote Irish island is the latest viral posting to attract thousands of applicants. But what’s it like to bag a job in a million?As another year of environmental turmoil and political upheaval loomed at the start of 2020, thousands of people – from Alaska to South Africa – turned their sights to the peace and tranquility of Great Blasket, a remote island a mile off the west coast of Ireland. There are no other residents, no electricity, wifi or hot water, but droves of would-be-caretakers were charmed by the idea of looking after a cafe and three cottages there.The posting, which has so far received more than 23,000 applications, is the latest “dream job” opportunity to go viral, following vacancies for a barefoot bookseller in the Males and a cat sanctuary manager on the Greek island of Syros. But do these dream jobs ever live up to expectations? And what of the one-of-a-kind jobs that never hit the headlines?We asked some lucky candidates to find out.It’s somewhat serendipitous that Mari Huws and Emyr Glyn Owen became the new wardens of Ynys Enlli. The couple met on the island on “a perfect summer afternoon” two years ago, so when they spotted the vacancy to run the place on Facebook, “we shared one of those looks between us – the looks that speak louder than words. We had to go for it,” says Huws. “Many people assume that people who want to live on an island are escaping from something, but for us it was more about realising a dream.”The pair quit their jobs, packed up their homes in north Wales and have hit the ground running since arriving in September 2019.The job involves manual labour: digging drains, building fences, mixing cement and fixing broken tractors. But no matter how tough the work, the pair can always end their day with a walk through the fields and a swim in the Irish Sea at sunset.“There aren’t many aspects of mainland life that we miss,” says Huws. “The boatman once told me that ‘the world comes to Enlli’ – and he’s right.”The posting had already gone international by the time the couple applied, but they managed to beat more than 10,000 other applicants to become the new keepers in May 2019.On a typical day, they wake up around 5.45am to prepare breakfast for 10 guests. Coffee is served at 7am, hot breakfast at 9am. There’s a history talk and demonstration of the antique foghorn equipment before guests are shuttled back to the mainland. Beds are remade, bathrooms cleaned and lunch is hastily eaten before the next guests arrive. Appetisers and sparkling wine are served, followed by a four-course meal, often using herbs and vegetables from the island’s garden. Danse and Waterson clock off around 10pm. “It’s definitely a full-time-plus job,” he says.Even “non-guest days” are busy with laundry, buying gasoline and groceries, and prepping food. “It’s easy to allow this to become your whole world,” says Danse. To enjoy a proper day off, the pair disappear away from the island, somewhere without cellphone reception. But they’re learning to carve out time for themselves on the island, too.“We’ll pull out our lawn chairs and look out at the city, maybe have a glass of wine,” says Waterson. “It’s rare that we sit and enjoy it but when we do, it’s amazing that we have this to ourselves – at least for a couple nights a week.”When the New York Times announced it wanted to send a journalist to every location on its list of 52 Places to Go in 2018, a cultural phenomenon ensued. The posting went viral, memes were generated and 13,000 people applied. Jada Yuan, then a staff writer at New York Magazine, was chosen as the lucky writer and soon embarked on a whistlestop tour covering 38 countries over six continents.“I knew I was going to have to take every moment I could to stop and enjoy it, but I also knew it was going to be a ton of work,” says Yuan. As well as pumping out Instagram updates, photographs and a print column each week, Yuan learned last-minute that she’d be organising most of the transport and accommodation herself. “It wasn’t until two days before I left that I realised that would mostly be on me,” she says. “I was constantly trying to get to the next place but also writing about the previous place.”Despite missing trains in India, running out of money in São Tomé and Príncipe, and battling an ever-growing list of articles to file, Yuan found ways to overcome the “travel rage” and enjoy the small wins.“There wasn’t really an average day on St Kilda, it’s a pretty wild place,” says Craig Stanford who, from April 2017 to November 2019, worked as the National Trust for Scotland’s resident archaeologist on the isolated archipelago.The post is a “semi-legendary job in Scottish archaeology”, says Stanford, who spent six months each year conserving, promoting and protecting the archipelago’s cultural heritage, including some of the 1,260 unique stone huts known as cleitean.“Food is probably the most challenging part of the job – you really have to plan it quite carefully,” says Stanford. A helicopter will try to deliver food twice a week, but in a place where “every hour of your day is defined by nature”, the archipelago is impenetrable most of the time. “You end up eating some weird things from the back of the cupboard.”The first time Karen Aspen set foot on a boat, she ended up on an eight-month adventure sailing around the Caribbean. As a temp for an Edinburgh catering company, she was sent to work as the onboard cook for a group of businessmen on a weekend sailing trip around Scotland’s west coast.Without a job to return to, she stayed with the 60ft yacht as it travelled down to Portsmouth on England’s south coast, helping out with a two-month renovation before joining its next voyage across the Atlantic. “I just said: ‘I could do that,’ as you do when you’re 19,” laughs Aspen. Once in Antigua, she cooked for wealthy tourists who chartered the yacht before it was hired by the Canadian film-maker Gregory Colbert to track sperm whales for his film Ashes and Snow.“I was one of those girls who had dolphins on her pencil case,” says Aspen. She never thought she’d see a whale or dolphin in real life, let alone learn to listen out for them on a hydrophone or have a job “where you could walk up on deck and there’d be a whale 10 feet from you”.And despite the complete lack of time off or personal space out on the water, she returned to the Caribbean several times after her spontaneous adventure to continue work on the film.“It was a real turning point for me in my life,” says Aspen. “I was meeting all these people who were following their passions and doing what they really wanted with their lives ... it’s something I would aspire to do – to live life on my own terms.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Rather than having teams of journalists focused on inidual programmes – such as the soon-to-be-axed Victoria Derbyshire show – there will be more pooling of reporters.In theory this will reduce duplication of effort, with groups of journalists working on investigations and original reporting before pushing it out across television, radio, and online. The BBC argues that the award-winning journalism, of shows such as Victoria Derbyshire’s can be produced for multiple outlets without the expense of presenting in the format of a standalone news outlet.Many BBC reporters fear this proposed system could become hard to operate in practice, given the different demands of outlets such as the Today programme and the BBC News website. There are also concerns that niche stories could no longer be covered as part of the push to unify more of the corporation’s news output.The BBC declined to comment on the announcement and would not confirm speculation that hundreds of jobs cuts are planned. The BBC is facing an uncertain financial future with the government reviewing whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee. Last week, Tony Hall, the director general,  announced he was stepping down to allow a successor to be appointed before the BBC begins negotiations with the government over the rate it can charge for the licence fee from 2022.Hall has also criticised the corporation for contributing to a toxic discourse around political journalism, which he said was aimed at trying to “catch out” politicians.Speaking at Edelman Trust Barometer 2020 event on Tuesday, he said: “I’m a great believer in the long-form political interview where you can explore at length, not in soundbites, the real policy decisions that politicians are making. Exploring those sort of nuances is an important part of what we should do.” In a separate development, on Tuesday the BBC told production staff who make non-news or sport programmes for the corporation’s national radio stations that about 60 redundancies were on the way.“Rising costs mean we shall end this year with a deficit of around a million pounds,” said Graham Ellis, the BBC’s controller of radio production, warning that his unit faced a decline in the “number and value of commissions” from the corporation’s national radio stations over the coming years and would have to cut a substantial proportion of the corporation’s in-house production staff.He said that while management would do its utmost to avoid compulsory redundancies, they could not be ruled out if not enough people chose to take a voluntary payout. He also said he wanted to create 40 new roles for content producers, suggesting an increased focus on social media output, although staff raised concerns that these would be paid less than traditional radio-producing jobs.Ellis said he was hoping podcasts could provide a way of increasing the amount of money flowing to his ision of the BBC, which competes with external independent production companies to make BBC programmes. “This is a tough message on which to start 2020 but I’m pleased to say we are also seeing reinvestment in some programmes from next year, especially documentaries and drama,” he said.“That’ll mean better programme budgets which help to protect staff time on programmes. We’re also investing in a development unit to capitalise on the popularity of podcasts which offer us an opportunity to grow new business.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/564b155e5b70b5bed49de9564dae3d574b99c14a/0_168_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e53b68c6efbdbb4244a735782cafe100","title":"land registry mortgage delays costs","story":"My partner and I extended the low lease of our new flat, a process which took nearly two years and cost £25,000. Our solicitor submitted the documentation to the Land Registry. She informed us there was a backlog and that it should be registered within two months. Five months later our fixed-rate mortgage was due to end so we found a new deal with a different lender, but it was rejected because Land Registry records still showed our property on a lease of less than 70 years. The Land Registry said that, in order to expedite the matter, we needed to send them a mortgage offer. But lenders will not give an offer on a property with a lease below 70 years. Instead, we sent the mortgage rejection letter, but it still insisted on an offer. We approached another lender and asked for some documentation stating we were applying for a mortgage, and this was sent to the Land Registry. Three months on, we are no further forward and have had to pay three months of our mortgage at the variable rate due to Land Registry delays. NL, LondonYou are among hundreds of homeowners paying the price for Land Registry delays. Last year, sales have fallen through as solicitors reported delays of more than six months to register new titles and update leases. The non-ministerial government department cut staffing levels after the 2008 crash, and has struggled to meet demand as the housing market recovered.As you found, it will only fast track an application for a lease extension within 10 days if you can prove that a mortgage offer has been made, which leaves those with registered leases of under 70 years in limbo.Not that that was any use to you or others with short leases that disqualify them from mortgage offers. Thankfully, your extension has now been registered with an apology for the “inconvenience”. That “inconvenience” has left you £584 out of pocket during the time you were stuck on a variable rate mortgage.The Land Registry says that the recruitment of 1,000 new staff, increased overtime and technology will be transforming its service.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Resale sites have previously been criticised for falsely indicating that there are only a few seats left, putting pressure on consumers to make snap decisions.StubHub is also failing to tell buyers where they will be sitting and omitting full contact details of its so-called “business sellers”, commonly known as ticket touts.The CMA is understood to have given StubHub until mid-February to make improvements to its website or face action through the courts.The regulator obtained a court order against resale websites last year, demanding that they comply with laws designed to protect consumers. It has already launched contempt of court proceedings against Viagogo for failing to do so.While the CMA dropped the case after Viagogo made some changes to its website, the regulator is understood to be receiving ongoing complaints about both companies.In December, it opened an investigation into Viagogo’s proposed £3.1bn takeover of StubHub to determine whether a combination of the only two major players in ticket resale would affect competition in the UK.FanFair Alliance, a music industry group backed by the managers of acts such as PJ Harvey, Mumford \u0026amp Sons and One Direction, said the CMA’s announcement “highlights continuing dysfunctions in the secondary ticketing market”.“It should also provide yet more impetus for regulators to investigate the proposed merger between Viagogo and StubHub,” it addedThe CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said StubHub’s alleged defiance of its court order supported the regulator’s call to be given powers to rule on whether companies have broken the law and impose fines.“StubHub had previously committed to make important changes to the information on its site, so anyone buying a ticket would know what they were getting before parting with their money. It’s therefore unacceptable that we have now found these concerns,” said Coscelli.“We have demanded swift action to resolve these problems and are pleased that StubHub has said it will make changes in response.“We will closely monitor the firm’s efforts and, if it does not quickly implement changes that satisfy us, we will take further action – potentially through the courts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bddca8b7c92101c284312ad650494b76f80eb6c7/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d126af8bc67ba2a2fe80a2ec843387e","title":"question time my life as a quiz obsessive","story":"I’ve taken part in quizzes all my life: in schools, in pubs and on TV shows, from India to the US. But the biggest secret is that curiosity, not knowledge, is the key to success. By  Samanth SubramanianLast March, when I went to Las Vegas for the very first time, I made sure to pack pens and paper. I knew we would need the supplies. We converged from various points on the US map: six of us, a guys’ weekend in Sin City. On Friday afternoon, we dawdled in the Hard Rock hotel, waiting with impatience for the action to begin. Dusk fell, the neon rose, and we gathered in the lobby. Together we walked through the maze of slot machines and blackjack tables, past the bar and the steakhouse, past the flyers for burlesque revues and up into the nightclub.And there, having spurned the vices of Vegas, we indulged our own, clustered around our team’s answer sheet as a quizmaster barked questions at us. The weekend, Geek Bowl XIII, had been put together as a blowout for quiz fiends who attended bar trivia nights across the US and still yearned for more. Friday was a warm-up quiz: calisthenics before the big game. On Saturday, 240 teams spent the evening packed into a Hard Rock auditorium, sweating their brains over 65 questions. You could buy beer and snacks while you quizzed, but no one seemed particularly keen on alcohol. You drink to forget you quiz to remember. The only Elvis impersonators I saw that weekend were part of a special round in the quiz, in which Vegas street-theatre performers staged cryptic re-enactments of famous movie scenes. (We had to identify the movies.) Another round had questions to which the answers all included types of cheese: Alison Brie, Goat, Grand Coulee Dam. In a third, we had to construct portmanteau phrases from images of snacks and celebrities. NutElla Fitzgerald. OvalTina Turner. Desmond TuTuna Helper. No quiz I’ve ever attended has provoked this much pained groaning at the answers.Which is saying something, because I’m entering my fourth decade of addiction. In my quizzing, there is to be found a story of my life. It is the single constant to which I’ve clung as I bounced between schools, universities, jobs and cities. In India, where I grew up, my obsession began with inter-school quizzes: teams of two or three, sitting behind desks, fielding questions in turn. When I was eight, I took part in my first, in Delhi. We missed out on winning on a tie-breaker, and for a week afterwards, I replayed that moment in my mind so vividly that I found it hard to fall asleep at night. In 1999, when I went to an American university to study journalism, I discovered Quiz Bowl tournaments, for which we practised once a week, iding up into teams and holding mock-contests in empty classrooms late into the night. I returned to India and, while working as a reporter, sank into the circuit of “open” quizzes, so-called because anyone is free to form a team and take part. Three years ago, after my wife and I moved for a brief stint to Ireland, I joined the Dublin Quiz League, conducted in pubs but otherwise a serious affair with difficult questions.Everywhere I have lived, I have attempted the World Quizzing Championship – an exam-like solo affair held all over the world on a particular June day. Last year, nearly 3,000 people took part. Its 240 questions, to be answered in two hours, are set by a tight group of enthusiasts who run the International Quizzing Association. For much of the year, I begin my days with a dose of six questions emailed to me and thousands of other subscribers of Learned League – an online quiz that solicits new players only through referrals from existing ones, ides us all into small brackets, and pits us against each other. (This morning, bound as ever by honour to refrain from Googling, I answered questions on shibboleths, umami, Assassin’s Creed and Indian princely states, but blundered on Dora the Explorer and surf guitar.) During holidays with friends who are fellow addicts, we’ve sought out pub quizzes: light fixes when we were craving the hard stuff. I wish I could say that we thought of them as dips into the local pub culture of Colombo, or Madrid, or Seattle, or Edinburgh, but we really went just for the questions. Whatever I’m doing at any point of the day, it is probably safe to assume that I would rather be quizzing.We ended up not doing very well in Vegas 100 teams and 25 points separated us from the winner of the $13,000 top prize. It was a reminder of how my quizzing has not only defined my life but has, in turn, been defined by it. Even in our age, when practically all the information in the world is available on our phones, what you know best is often a product of where you have been. In my team were five men who had grown up in India. The sixth, the lone American, had to bear the burden of recalling Tuna Helper, Yoo-Hoo and other snacks from his childhood he was also the one we turned to when we needed to know the number of Canadian teams in the National Hockey League or the name of the country singer Tammy Wynette’s husband. We felt like a basketball team playing with our shoelaces tied together.That we got many answers right nonetheless was the result of a remarkable shift in quizzing culture over the past two decades – another way in which quizzing has closely tracked my life. I started quizzing when I had the sticky memory of a teenager my mind held facts without effort and yielded them instantly. Back in the 90s, quizzing demanded this quality above all else. As I got older, my mind shed some of its retentive powers. But quizzing, too, has changed its questions have come to privilege not just memory but also breadth, deduction and lateral thinking. This new shape was a response to the rise of the internet, and it called upon a truer, more natural form of our relationship with knowledge – of what it means to know the answer to a question.There isn’t even a word for us, really. Quiz players? Trivia fanatics? I prefer quizzers. But when I use that to describe myself to a civilian – to a non-quizzer – the inevitable inquiry follows: “What does that mean?” For that question, ironically, there is no easy answer.The problem is not that no one knows what a quiz is. Quite the contrary, in fact the problem is that nearly everyone has quizzed, or has at least seen a quiz, at some point in their lives. They have caught clips of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Or they have played a multiple-choice Friends trivia game online. Or they have been set a general knowledge quiz in school. Or they have learned to avoid the local pub on Tuesdays, when it hosts Trivia Night in 2013, The Publican, a trade magazine, found that 23,000 out of the UK’s 60,000-odd pubs have at least one quiz a week.Everyone knows how a quiz works: a question asked, an answer ventured, a binary verdict of correct or incorrect handed down, next question please. They suspect that quizzing depends upon an ability to soak up facts: capitals of US states, currencies of countries, names of authors, Academy award winners. Where they flounder is in imagining how something this commonplace can turn into a passion, into a marker of identity. A quizzer? It’s like describing yourself as a doodler or a shower-singer.The most visible quizzes, the ones on TV, are also those that least graze the lives of quizzers. I have been on the Indian edition of Mastermind, and I have friends who have appeared on Only Connect, Jeopardy! and Millionaire. But these were one-offs. The selection process is competitive, and there are too few shows to sustain the ardent quizzer. The most frequent, hardcore quizzing always happens under the radar, attended by the few dozen regulars in each city who never stop wondering why their tribe isn’t larger. For the Dublin Quiz League, we borrowed corner tables in pubs on slow weeknights: a quizmaster and two teams at each table, questions murmured out of earshot of the patrons sipping Guinness at the bar. In universities, Quiz Bowl tournaments requisition classrooms. In Bangalore, quizzes take place in a seminar hall rented from the Institution of Agricultural Technologists during holidays, when there isn’t an agricultural technologist for miles around. So many quizzes happen on Sundays that a passerby peeping into one of these rooms anywhere in the world might take in the hushed conferrals and the gnostic atmosphere and believe that a Christian cult’s prayer meeting is in session.In such quizzes, the material rewards are scanty, often non-existent. You compete for pride, and even that can only be enjoyed within the small, cramped confines of this subculture. The more pathetic the prize, it would seem, the greater the sincere quizzer’s dedication. In Amsterdam, where I once happened to be on holiday on the day of the World Quizzing Championship, I came an all-Netherlands third and won a Jabra Bluetooth earpiece. It is my most sophisticated piece of quiz loot ever. I still haven’t figured out how to sync it with my phone.When I was a member of the Pennsylvania State University Quiz Bowl Club, we would pool our money to rent a car, drive across two or three states and stay in a cheap motel near another university that was hosting a tournament. We would lug along “the Judge” – a buzzer set built into a briefcase, with protruding red and green lights, looking for all the world like a B-movie bomb. (If you brought along your own buzzer, you got $5 or $10 knocked off your registration fee.) All weekend, our squad of four played half-hour University Challenge-style games against other teams, buzzing inidually on 10-point questions and conferring on 30-point bonuses. The scorelines often ran tight, but the real drama was private, internal: the mortification at buzzing wrongly on a question your teammate surely knew the glee at encountering a question your team had come across in practice only the previous week. Nominally, the tournament produced a champion: the team that had won the most games, and that often received just a kitschy trophy for its labours. Come Sunday evening, we would pack up the Judge, hop back into the car, and reach our dorms close to midnight. Sometimes, we would read questions to each other on the way home.In India too, the most intense quizzing events occupy all of a weekend. Quiz festivals, we call them, as if we’re recognising them as rituals in the calendar of some deviant paganism. If you pass through the written preliminary round into the eight-team final, you will encounter some of the most elaborate quizzes on the planet one film quiz I attend every June plays almost 100 minutes of video, short snatches patiently clipped and reclipped to offer a clue or reveal an answer. Across seven or eight quizzes over three days, a quizzer might face as many as 600 questions. By Sunday evening, you feel as if someone has been punching you in the head you also feel deeply sorry that the weekend is over.To attend these contests, quizzers rearrange the furniture of their lives, budgeting their time away from their families, or ensuring that they don’t travel overseas for work during a quiz weekend. I know one quizzer who switched jobs because his city’s quiz scene wasn’t active enough I know another who scheduled his wedding to avoid a clash with a quiz. Once, while we were waiting around for a popular annual quiz to begin, a friend remarked that his wife was heavily pregnant he hoped she wouldn’t go into labour over the next few hours. That would be unfortunate, we agreed.“No, you don’t understand,” he said. “If my daughter’s born today, that means she’ll have a birthday party on this date every year. Which means I can never come to this quiz again.”Admitting to such a fevered love isn’t a good look, I realise. The very premise of quizzing can appear to be a fetishising of book learning: of facts memorised for their own sake, instead of being learned from any true engagement with life. At best, this can feel charmingly antique in the 21st century, when the internet and its infinite electronic lobes do our remembering for us. At worst, quizzers are thought to suck up facts only to win meaningless contests that cater to their intellectual vanities they are typecast as people who have such a transactional relationship with knowledge that they really can be said to know very little at all.But at its finest, quizzing today is never about shallow recall it’s an exercise in nimble thinking, and possibly the only forum where the entirety of your life – everything you’ve ever seen, read, tasted, heard, heard of, or lived through – can be marshalled as pure knowledge. A friend of mine, an English professor in a college in Bangalore, once called quizzing an act of bricolage – a term that the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used to describe how even a small number of ideas may be mixed and combined to create something novel and unforeseen. The process thrives on freshness and play, and it holds a sense of limitless possibility – of producing many, many things we never knew out of the few things we do know.The deconstruction of a question is one of quizzing’s high pleasures. Here’s one that I set for a quiz a few years ago. The root word is the proto-Indo-European bhel. Out of this springs a host of related words (in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese) and also an English word. Strangely, the English word is precisely the opposite of the others. The reason, it has been surmised, has to do with fire, bhel. The words of the Romance languages refer to the brightness of fire, but the English word refers to its final remains. What words are we talking about?The question is designed for teamwork and deductive leaps, not for quick familiarity with proto-Indo-European etymologies. The brightness of fire and its final remains evoke two images: the white heat of flame and the char left behind. They are opposites, most evidently, by virtue of their colours. If the English word describing the char is “black”, then the Romance counterparts must be translations of “white”: blanca, blanc, bianca, branca, all words that might very conceivably have derived from bhel.It’s a difficult question, but I love it for its feat of bricolage – for how it does so much with so little. The foreknowledge potentially required to answer it is minimal: really, just the word for “white” in any one of a number of European languages. You don’t need to speak fluent French or Spanish to have come across terms like carte blanche” or Casablanca, and the merest curiosity about their literal meanings will have yielded all that you require.But with this single key, such a rich universe is unlocked: the evolution of language, and its elemental roots the beautiful, contradictory union of black and blanc: everyday words which, at the slightest inquisitive tug, ulge their history. The answer is satisfying even if you don’t solve it. It has what University Challenge’s question-setters call “inherent interest”, and what Indian quizzers call “funda”, short for fundamental: an easy appeal for anyone, and a burst of joy at encountering an unsuspected elegance in the world.When I was 15 or 16, in 1997, we got our first internet connection at home, and I discovered Quiznet, a mailing list full of junkies like me. You could set a quiz and send it out people wrote to you with their attempts over the subsequent week, and then you released their scores and the correct answers. In my first Quiznet quiz, which included seven questions on cocktails, I asked: “Which cocktail, made of bourbon, sugar and mint, is associated with the Kentucky Derby?” Answer: the mint julep. I had read about the Kentucky Derby in a book I’ve forgotten its title, but the mint julep has stuck.This standard model of quizzing – short, stiff questions, to which you either knew the answer or you didn’t – had been around in India for decades. Its progenitor, in quizzing lore, was a Calcutta man named Neil O’Brien who had spent time in England, grown fond of its pub quizzes and taken the concept back with him. Even when he conducted his first quiz, at a parish hall in 1967, quizzing was a relatively young pursuit, in comparison to the life s of other pastimes. The Romans did not quiz. Neither did the Aztecs. We have no evidence of quizzing in Mughal India or Ming China. It didn’t feature among the parlour games of the 19th century. The Victorians preferred charades or squeak piggy squeak, a variation of blind man’s bluff – perhaps understandably, because at the time, to ask questions about distant countries or art or literature would have presumed an implausible breadth of access to texts and education.The first quizzes emerged, naturally, in schools, where students could be tested on a shared body of knowledge. King William’s College, on the Isle of Man, has wrung answers out of its pupils in an annual quiz that began in 1905. In 1934, the year O’Brien was born, the quiz’s categories included bishops, coinage and literary queens, and its questions already wore the garb of the cryptic-crossword clue for which it later became famous. “Who balked who of his fame ‘with a worm’?” If you didn’t recall that phrase from the 288-line Tennyson poem A Dream of Fair Women, you had only the slenderest hope of responding correctly with Cleopatra and Caesar. This was not a quiz for lackadaisical readers.In the US, the military tested basic knowledge as part of its Alpha examination of recruits. (A 1921 multiple-choice form asked: “The Penguin is a: Bird, Reptile, Insect.” No intimacies with Tennyson were required.) But for a while, as Alan Connor recounts in his book The Joy of Quiz, the purpose of this pursuit remained foggy, if intriguing. The two authors of Ask Me Another!, a compendium of questions published in 1928, thought it a fine idea to quiz celebrities and record their performances, but they were often met with confusion. “I didn’t quite understand just what it was he wanted to do to me,” the humourist Robert Benchley wrote after being approached by one of the authors. The book sold well, but it didn’t seem to spread the love very far. Why would anyone wish to commit such arcane details to memory, reviewers wondered. “A man who treasures up a piece of information like the height of the Brooklyn Bridge has a screw loose somewhere,” the New York World decided.By the time the second world war ended, though, the culture shifted, and quizzing came to be appreciated as entertainment, not imposition. The knowledge “bees” on British radio inspired quizzes in pubs and youth clubs. On US television, shows such as Twenty-One and The $64,000 Question drew rapt audiences. In 1953, US universities also started to compete in a radio programme called College Quiz Bowl it moved to TV as College Bowl and provided the template for University Challenge in Britain, which first aired on ITV in 1962.The questions in Quiz Bowl, College Bowl’s direct descendant, are thickly academic. When I first quizzed at university, I needed a few months to calibrate myself – to get used to dredging answers not out of my recreational reading but out of my textbooks and classroom lectures. But I came to relish the density of the toss-ups – the starter questions, as they are called on University Challenge – and how they unwrap themselves in orderly fashion. A question starts with the most opaque clues: “A wreath of flowers sent to this politician’s funeral is the origin for the name of the Primrose League.” More facts follow midway, perhaps at “He controversially took a loan from Lionel de Rothschild”, there is just enough light and enough material to buzz in with a guess. Certainly at the transparent end – “Name this Conservative prime minister of Jewish descent, the rival of William Gladstone” – we know the answer is Benjamin Disraeli.The delight lies in how certain facts may be obscure to some and immediately clear to others, or how even the same information may be held and organised in different ways by different minds. Once, at a tournament, I buzzed after three words – “President Cheddi Jagan” – and, in wild surmise that the question would ask for a country, ventured: “Guyana”.I was right, but there was no reason for me to have known that – except that, years ago, I’d seen Jagan in a cheesy Unesco advertisement that played throughout the breaks of an India-West Indies cricket broadcast. He appeared above his name and title, offering such a cheesy thumbs-up that I’ve never forgotten him. In the same game, I came up empty while trying to remember the name of the Deccan Plateau – the triangular chunk of southern India, where I lived for much of my childhood. There is nothing to be done about the caprices of memory – but somehow, that makes quizzing more exciting, not less. And it sweetens the sudden, climactic illumination: the microsecond when the brain, acting almost outside your will, pulls the clues together to recognise the answer, as cleanly as if you had known it all along. The quest for that moment is the source of the addiction.There are so many different formats of quizzing that no one can be described as the world’s best quizzer. But Pat Gibson can certainly stake a claim. He’s won the World Quizzing Championship four times. In 2004, he won a phlegmatic million on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in 2006, he won Brain of Britain, the BBC Radio 4 quiz. Today his diet involves three quiz leagues in which his team takes part. “Serious quizzing,” Gibson said approvingly, describing the leagues to me when we met in November. Additionally, five or six weeks a year, he takes the train from Wigan, where he lives, to Glasgow, to appear as an Egghead on the BBC show of that name. The format often requires a challenger to take Gibson on solo. You have to feel for the challenger.Gibson, 58, didn’t properly start quizzing until he was in his early 30s. Growing up in Ireland, he devoured atlases and maps, but he only ever went to one major quiz: the Brain of Ireland, where, as a teenager, he got stage fright and didn’t say a word. After moving to England, he worked as a software engineer, and in the 90s, a colleague roped him into a quiz league. He got so good that, a decade later, he decided to do it more seriously.Gibson has built himself software into which he keys facts that he comes across on some days, he will add as many as 100 facts to his database, culled from books, TV or his perusal of The Times over breakfast. If he is driving and he hears something compelling on the radio, he will pull over and scribble it down in the notebook he always carries with him. He sets time aside for revision. He may decide, next week, that it’s been too long since he brushed up on the Vietnam war, so he will call up the file and study it. He has built files on all sorts of subjects. Sometimes he wonders if he could acquire an appreciation of, say, Ibsen’s plays purely via his Ibsen file, without watching or reading any of the plays themselves.Frequently, Gibson talks about questions as if he were Genghis Khan surveying central Asia: “All those inidual little fortresses, each one begging to be conquered,” he says, practically licking his lips in anticipation. People often assume that his only weapon is his tenacious memory. “Well, yes, remembering is obviously important,” he says, “but it isn’t decisive.” Even after mastering a database, there is no way to know every possible question-answer pair cold nearly always, a quizzer is making a reasoned guess, even when they are certain that their answer is correct. What Gibson values far more than memory is his capacity to submerge himself in a topic. “If you answered a question about Alexander the Great, it’s because you were interested in Alexander the Great, and you read about Alexander the Great,” he said. “Curiosity – there’s a big payoff for curiosity.”Within the philosophy of quizzing, it isn’t easy to define what precisely makes a fact worth retaining. It has to have the ring of novelty, or the tilt of oddity, or the gloss of some human achievement it has to sit at an angle to all the rest of the information that continually laps at our feet. “The number of eggs produced every year in Cambridgeshire – that isn’t interesting to a quizzer,” Gibson says. Unless the number is zero, it isn’t distinctive other counties produce eggs, too, and the statistic says nothing intriguing about Cambridgeshire. On the other hand, on the morning of the day we met, Gibson had prospected a nugget out of the newspaper: that the actor Eddie Marsan has situs inversus, a condition in which the positions of major internal organs are flipped into the opposite side of the body. That only seemed to beguile Gibson into further inquiry. How common is situs inversus? How does the human frame handle this inversion? Who else has situs inversus? The fact went straight into Gibson’s database.Every quizzer practises some such form of information triage. (On my phone, a Notes file is dedicated to gobbets of fact that I’ve come across and want to pursue. The latest entry: “The names of hydrogen and oxygen – Greek for ‘water-former’ and ‘acid-former’ respectively – should actually be reversed. It’s hydrogen that forms acids and oxygen that forms water.”) This habit can make quizzing out to be a kind of intellectual escapism – a constant flight from the big, boring everyday into the eccentric or the significant. But it is, in fact, the opposite. Quizzing invites us to pay extra attention, not only to what we read or watch but also to what is around us. For all its flaws, Slumdog Millionaire got that part about quizzing right. In the movie, Jamal Malik, a young man from Mumbai’s slums, goes on a hot streak on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, prompting suspicion in everyone. How would a kid like this, with his narrow, limited existence, know the statesman whose portrait appears on a $100 bill or the city in which Cambridge Circus lies? But he had been tipped $100 by an American tourist while working as a phoney tour guide at the Taj Mahal, and he had served tea in a call centre where the clusters of cubicles and their aisles were named after British cities and their streets. That’s how he knew.In less dramatic, Oscar-winning ways, that has happened to every quizzer: an answer pried out of some ancient circumstance, like Cheddi Jagan from a Unesco advertisement. In psychology, episodic memory is distinguished from semantic memory. The first recollects autobiographical events – past birthdays, a first kiss, a car accident – while the second stores facts, like names of cities or Ballon d’Or winners or chemical element symbols. In our minds, during a quiz, these categories don’t feel nearly as separate every slice of episodic memory seems to be embedded with facts that we can pick out, like plums in a pie. During one of his Mastermind runs, Gibson got a question about the USS Pueblo, a spy ship once captured by North Korea. “It was like a Proustian moment,” he said. “In a flash, I was back to being a boy, sitting on the floor of our house in Letterkenny, reading a Reader’s Digest article on the Pueblo.” Even our most secondhand knowledge is tied intimately to our first-hand experiences. If you stay alert and inquisitive, the best preparation for quizzing can be life itself.My time in quizzing has overlapped tidily with the web’s renovation of the sport. Mainly, its effect has been to vastly expand the realm of subjects that might feature in quiz questions. In the US, the more academic style of Quiz Bowl was supplemented in the late 1990s by Trash tournaments, which quizzed students on video games, comic books, pop music and decidedly non-classic TV and cinema. The web held reservoirs of detail about these topics that made it possible to frame sound questions about them in an earlier era, setting a Trash question pack by relying on the library would have been a punishing task.European quizzes grew more capacious as well. “I’ve looked in old quiz books, and the questions are dreadful, frankly,” Jack Waley-Cohen, one of the question editors for the BBC show Only Connect, told me. “There was an assumption that everybody knew the same things.” Now, quizmasters don’t ever ask who the chancellor of the exchequer was in 1973, he said. “For one, someone who is an expert in television or music has an opportunity to demonstrate it, because there are questions on that. But also, the questions I like don’t test absolute knowledge. They test lateral thinking, and your ability to access knowledge.”The greatest internet-driven transformation has occurred in Indian quizzing, where questions have bloomed into intricate puzzles, strewing clues through wordplay, snippets of video, clips of audio, and photos. My morsel about the mint julep would never make the cut today: it’s too dry, too plain. Questions are longer and denser now, and devised to be unlocked in multiple ways, as in the blanc-black case. Logic and teamwork are indispensable. In these quizzes, one may even lavish the compliment “Good answer!” – not for the right response, mind, but for a guess that makes inventive use of the facts provided. The creativity of this style of quizzing, I’m convinced, is also a reaction to the stodginess that infects Indian education. Studying in India involves scant imagination and heavy doses of rote learning examinations admit no such notion as a “good answer”, merely correct and incorrect ones. Just as the internet offered its bottomless resources to those with wide, various interests, quizzing became a canvas to express these interests.The more perplexing issue is that of gender. The subculture tends to be overwhelmingly male – a problem that has been visible wherever I have quizzed, from Ireland to India. Local patterns of sexism might account for some of it. But the universality of this imbalance suggests that the old, male domination of systems of knowledge – even informal ones – is still solid and immovable, like a boulder across a road. As a result, quizzing lays itself open to the accusation that it doesn’t try hard enough to be inclusive, and that it is content largely to be a space into which men can escape to hang out with other men – like poker nights, but for nerds who happen to know why a two-pair of black eights and aces is called a Dead Man’s Hand. (When Wild Bill Hickok, the American frontiersman, was shot in the head during a poker game in a South Dakota saloon in 1876, these were supposedly the cards he held.) For all the quick intelligence that quizzing demands, it can also be slow and witless in avoiding the worst traits of the culture it inhabits.This is unfortunate, because quizzing really is, in principle, among the most equitable of sports. A well-set quiz will not cater exclusively to any inborn prowess. Instead, by being wide-ranging and original, it takes as its premise a powerful truth: no one knows everything, and everyone in the room knows something that the others don’t. Each fresh question is played on a newly levelled field, offering the distinct possibility that the newcomer may beat the veteran to the answer. The guy on the couch never watches Ben Stokes get bowled in a Test match with the certainty that he could have done better. But he might well watch an Oxford team on University Challenge fumble an answer that he knows and be sure that, within that pocket of erudition, he has proven a winner.These inidual triumphs can come about because no two lives experience the world in identical ways. There is something beautifully human about that, just as there is something beautifully human about the very act of remembering – especially now, when we are fast ceding our intelligence to our machines. We don’t always need to remember facts any more, given that we can look them up or store them more and more, we relieve our minds of this duty. But that’s precisely why, in a quiz, it’s gratifying to excavate answers from our memories, as if to prove to ourselves that we are still capable of it. And it feels pure and liberating that this is knowledge stripped of any practical purpose. It has lodged in our neurons not because it has been programmed in to serve a function, as with computers, but because the human brain is an insatiable, indiscriminating sponge.For the moment, too, it appears as if we have this caper of the intellect just to ourselves. The machines are already defeating us at chess and Go, solving mathematical problems, and identifying fake works of art. But as of now, they can only hoard deep reserves of facts, producing one of them when queried specifically for it. They only know what they can store they don’t yet have a way to go from not knowing to knowing, the way we do so unconsciously in quizzing. It is true that, in 2013, an IBM supercomputer named Watson trounced two former champions on US quiz show Jeopardy! But it turned out to be a perverse badge of pride for our species that IBM spent billions of dollars on the machine, deployed it in a quiz show where buzzer reflexes matter as much as answers, and had to discard its brute, fact-crunching approach for an algorithm that sifted hypotheses, appraised language, processed allusions, and made associations. Thinking like a human, it turned out, is still something that humans do better than machines.No other quizzing computers have come forth since. Which isn’t to say that they won’t ever in fact, we may turn into such devices ourselves, if we elect to install the kind of brain-machine interfaces that Elon Musk and others want to develop. I suppose this will be like having a Google search bar in each of our heads, the cursor blinking, ready to ransack every viable bank of information. Maybe the power to know absolutely everything will result in some elevated, as yet unimaginable form of quizzing, but I have my doubts. Quizzing depends too much on not knowing. I don’t mean this in the hard-nosed, free-market sense that only deficits of knowledge can determine winners and losers, or as airy solace that our limitations make us beautiful. I mean that the purpose of quizzing is to discover the answers, to work with meagreness, to build sufficiency out of insufficiency. It is to fashion your own lamp and guide yourself to the truth that black and blanc are shoots with the same root. In this manner, the world comes slowly into focus, question by question.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf954fca5b1f653f5040dd6c1c42554cb710597e/0_0_5952_3571/master/5952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f444f9a9a2f182965d6757c7ac969db","title":"life after auschwitz podcast","story":"Ivor Perl and Susan Pollack were 12 and 13 when they were transported to Auschwitz.

The site had been evacuated by the Nazis just days earlier. Thus ended the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. Precise numbers are still debated, but according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1 million to 1.3 million Jews sent to the camp.

Starmer received 88 nominations from MPs, Nandy received 31, while Long-Bailey received 33.The development reflects tensions between rival wings of the party – and supporters of the four remaining candidates for the leadership – over the conduct of the contest, which comes after Labour’s worst general election result since 1935.Clive Betts, the chair of the housing select committee who nominated the current favourite Starmer, said there is “a lack of even handedness” in the way the party has made decisions over the leadership battle.“Momentum have got their information and they are using it. As an MP, I have got to have the right to communicate my views to my constituency’s members during a crucial election. We can’t have a discussion about what went wrong in the election without talking about iniduals.“It is wrong that the party sent out these rules without having a discussion with the parliamentary Labour party first,” he said.Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn and a Starmer supporter, said: “My local members are some of the most engaged in the country – if I take a shower I get emails asking how hot it was – so to not be able to communicate my own feelings to those members who I work with on the biggest decision facing the party for years is staggering.”Vicky Foxcroft, the MP for Lewisham Deptford and a Nandy supporter, said: “There is only one membership list that can be used at the moment and it’s the Momentum one, and only one team has access to it.“We want more democracy and to make people accountable whilst choosing our next leader. But without membership lists with which you can communicate with members, how are we supposed to have those important conversations?” she said.In an email sent on 6 January from Labour HQ, MPs were warned that “elected representatives or their staff must not use their access to members contact information to communicate about the election including the promotion of a preferred candidate.

It would ensure Jerusalem is both the capital of Israel and the Palestinian people.“I would urge him rather than being so characteristically negative to reach out to his friend, my friend, our friends in the Palestinian authority, to Mahmoud Abbas – for whom I have the highest respect – and urge him for once to engage, to get talking rather than to leave a political vacuum.”Corbyn hit back that Trump’s plan “will not bring any move towards peace, has no support from any Palestinian anywhere in the world”.Trump has unveiled his vision for Middle East peace in a White House launch on Tuesday, standing next to the smiling Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.The US leader announced details of the 181-page plan to cheers and applause but Palestinian leaders were absent from the launch, having rejected his proposal.The plan, released by the White House, said the proposal intended to:Abbas, the Palestinian president, criticised the deal as a conspiracy that “will not pass”, while in Gaza, the Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhr described the document as worthless. “Palestine will prevail, and Trump and the deal will go to the dustbin of history,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account. I could make my own decisions, and buy the kids the things they needed, without having to beg or fear his anger.HSBC UK is working with local housing and homelessness charities to provide bank accounts to people without a fixed address, helping to break the cycle of financial exclusion.

There they interact with gases in the atmosphere, including oxygen and nitrogen, increasing the energy of these gases – energy which is subsequently released as light.“This is the same as neon lamps,” said Minna Palmroth, a professor of computational space physics at the University of Helsinki. “Basically we can say the auroras are celestial neon lamps.”The northern lights have been seen in many forms, including “quiet arcs”, spirals and corona.But now, thanks to the work of amateur enthusiasts, Palmroth and colleagues say they have discovered a previously unknown form, a pattern they claim resembles sand dunes.The discovery came about when Palmroth was invited to join a Facebook group for aurora enthusiasts to explain the science behind the different forms of the phenomenon.As part of the project Palmroth asked the community of citizen scientists to capture images of particular forms. But there was a conundrum. “Some of them asked me ‘what about these stripes, which form are they?’,” she said.With the pattern apparently new to scientific literature, Palmroth asked the citizen scientists to take further images of the aurora. “I was basically sitting on my couch and sending real-time messages to the observers saying ‘take these kinds of pictures’.” The community did not disappoint – the images sent included two taken at the same time from different sites in Finland.That allowed Palmroth and colleagues to determine the altitude and other aspects of the phenomenon, such as the spacing between the ripples of the “dunes”.Palmroth said the green colour of the display is produced by excited oxygen, with further work revealing its form is probably down to disturbances in the atmosphere, known as gravity waves – these are the same sort of ripples that form when a pebble is tossed into a pond. In the atmosphere, however, waves often travel vertically upwards – and there are many of them. That, said Palmroth, offered a clue.Palmroth explained that mechanism could be an unusual event called a mesospheric bore, whereby a particular wave is filtered out and bent, allowing it to travel horizontally between two layers in the atmosphere. The phenomenon, she said, is similar to a tidal bore seen in rivers. Palmroth said this can happen when, unusually, the temperature of one layer of the atmosphere is slightly higher than both the layers above it and below it.The dune-like appearance of the aurora, the team say, is down to the wave producing peaks and troughs in the density of oxygen.Details of the discovery are published in the journal AGU Advances.• The subheading of this article was amended on 29 January 2020 to remove the suggestion that the discovery itself was made by people in a Facebook group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f9e5ca8c07c86f496a87d90e36d7ec26a87e50/0_2350_7110_4265/master/7110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f83eb6885cc615ff0b91e76b52066a24","title":"child cruelty case triggers call for home schooling review","story":"Northamptonshire parents jailed for neglect and abuse of ‘home educated’ sonChild protection experts have called for a national review of home schooling following an inquiry into a case in which a violent stepfather and his partner subjected their young son to extreme neglect and abuse.The boy – known as Child AB – endured four years of cruelty including being beaten, locked in his room and forced to defecate on the floor, fed stale food and banned from speaking to his siblings.He was taken into care in 2016. His parents, a 34-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman were convicted of five counts of child cruelty last May, and jailed for seven and three years respectively.An official serious case review published on Wednesday by the Northamptonshire safeguarding children partnership, found significant failures by social workers and NHS staff who it said had missed early chances to remove the boy.“Fortunately, in this case, Child AB did not die. If children’s social care and police had not acted when the school passed on the concerns arising from disclosures by Child AB’s siblings, then the outcome could have been very different,” the review said.“However, by not instigating child protection procedures when previous referrals had been made to children’s services Child AB was left to endure continuing neglect and serious abuse for years.”It highlighted the controlling and manipulative nature of the stepfather, who singled out Child AB for acts of “extreme cruelty”, while seemingly treating the boy’s other siblings differently. Although he had no parental responsibility, safeguarding professionals failed to challenge him on this, the review found.The stepfather took total control of decisions regarding Child AB between 2012, when he entered the family, and 2016, refusing to engage with professionals, not taking him to health appointments, and effectively cutting the child’s mother out of any communication with the school and social workers.The boy’s mother, the review found, “abdicated her responsibilities and duties as a parent” to the stepfather.Although at one stage Northamptonshire county council social services set up a “child in need” plan, it closed the file after three months after deciding there were no concerns for the child’s welfare.The review states: “Within weeks of closing the case, stepfather made professionals aware of his intention to electively home educate Child AB. These decisions resulted in Child AB not being seen by any professional for over a year. In effect, child AB was hidden from view and the abuse perpetrated by stepfather, with a lack of protection by mother, continued.”However, Child AB was never home educated as his stepfather never submitted an application form. This resulted, the review says, “in the child being out of school, effectively out of sight for a period of 14 months”. Attempts by the school to get the forms completed appear to have been rebuffed.The review recommended that national plans in regards to home educated children should be reviewed, and that more resources should be made available to assess and monitor children who are taken out of school to be educated at home.The report states: “Whilst it is currently a parent’s right to elect to home educate their child, the sanctions for not complying with the local authority requirement to visit the child’s home, interview the child, see the child’s work and provide information concerning the programme of work produced by the child, are limited.”Northamptonshire county council’s cabinet member for children’s services, Fiona Baker, said: “We are deeply sorry for any poor decision making and mistakes which may have contributed to this awful case of abuse. Children’s services in Northamptonshire are on an improvement journey and although much progress has been made there is still a lot to do.”The case is the third high-profile serious case review in recent years involving Northamptonshire county council children’s services.Last year two reports found that professionals missed crucial opportunities to save two toddlers who were murdered by men with histories of domestic violence, crime and drug use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6705246f45b60f6cccb5c4c057165534081e5add/0_362_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55c4c919bc359965c66a7478b1befc0b","title":"i always wanted to be a dad the rise of single fathers by choice","story":"A growing number of men are pursuing parenthood through surrogacy, adoption or fostering – without a partner. Here, dads who have gone it alone share their storiesThe first night Joe Norton brought home his adoptive sons, Tarren and Owen, he considered his new life, then thought: what have I done? “It’s a monumental decision you’re making, and you’re making it on your own,” says the 54-year-old educational manager from Yorkshire. “The enormity hit me.”Going from being a single man to the sole carer for two children was tougher than he had expected. There was the misbehaviour, particularly when the boys, who are brothers, began to settle in. (Experts call this period “regression”, but it is usually a sign that children are beginning to relax around their new parents.) He was also stumped by unexpected questions – what size socks did the boys wear? Norton had no clue what to buy. “You have an idea what size a T-shirt should be, but socks are a different thing,” he says, chuckling.But it was rewarding, much more so than Norton had hoped or dreamed. Three months after the adoption was completed, in October 2012, Norton took Owen and Tarren – then aged six and five respectively – on a break with family friends. On that holiday, the boys started calling him “Dad”. “It was emotional,” Norton says. “It was all starting to happen.”Norton is one of the growing number of men in the UK who are choosing to become single fathers. Whether through surrogacy, adoption or fostering, these men are deciding to go it alone. While there are no reliable figures documenting the number of men starting families on their own (rather than becoming the primary caregiver after their partner leaves or dies), experts agree that it is becoming more common. There was a record number of single-parent adoptions in 2018. The singer Ricky Martin had twin sons via a surrogate, while the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is rumoured to have used the same method to have his eldest three children.“We are seeing more men wanting to adopt than in recent years,” says Natalie Gamble, a lawyer specialising in fertility and surrogacy law. In addition to the spike in adoptions, Gamble tells me that single-father surrogacy is becoming more prevalent after a long-awaited change in the law enabled single parents who use surrogates to apply for full rights over their child. “Parents have to apply to the family courts for a parental order previously, only couples were able to do this.”Without a parental order, a surrogate could, theoretically, reclaim their child at any moment – a prospect that terrorised Ian Mucklejohn for many years. In 2001, Mucklejohn, a business owner from Newbury, became Britain’s first surrogate single father. Then 58, he used an egg donor and a surrogate in the US to have triplets – Piers, Lars and Ian. Although Mucklejohn was their biological father, he would have had no legal recourse to keep the boys if the surrogate, Tina Price, had chosen to claim them. “All she had to do was get on a plane and come and get them, no matter what she had signed,” he says.The law changed in January 2019, after Gamble brought to the high court a test case involving a British single father who had had a son, “Z”, via a US surrogate. (Having initially contested the case, the government conceded that the law discriminated against single parents when the president of the family ision of the court declared it incompatible with human rights legislation.) Now, solo parents who have children through a surrogate can apply for a parental order listing them as the child’s only legal parent. Gamble was there the day that the father of “Z” obtained his parental order, the first in the UK to record only a father. “It felt really monumental,” she says.Thanks to the legal change, more men are considering surrogacy. “The options are opening up,” Gamble says. “More British surrogates are willing to be matched with fathers.” Dr Sophie Zadeh of University College London is researching the men who choose to become single fathers, in conjunction with the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Family Research. She tells me that many men decide to go it alone for the same reason that many women do – none of their relationships have worked out and they want to have children before they are too old.This was the case for Norton, who separated from his wife in 2009. “I’d always grown up expecting to have children,” he says. “I’m the oldest of four and three of my siblings are adopted, so when my marriage broke down without children I decided that adoption was the best way.” But going through the adoption process on his own was difficult – it is an intrusive process that can take years, and there is no one to share your frustrations with.But not everyone who becomes a single father does so in the wake of a failed relationship. “I always knew, from a very young age, that I wanted to be a dad – and also that I never wanted to be a biological father,” says 35-year-old Ben Carpenter, a stay-at-home parent from West Yorkshire. “There were vulnerable children out there and I wanted to adopt them.” Carpenter applied to adoption services aged 21. “I knew it was what I wanted to do. Instantly, I completely found my niche.”Over the next decade, Carpenter adopted five children: Jack, Ruby, Lily, Joseph and Teddy. All have special needs – Lily is deaf, Ruby is blind, Jack is autistic and Joseph has Down’s syndrome. Teddy died last year, aged two, from complications relating to Cornelia de Lange syndrome. “He was a wonderful little boy,” Carpenter says. “We’re all gutted.” They set a place for Teddy at the dinner table this Christmas, as a reminder that he was still part of the family.Being a single dad can be challenging if, like Carpenter, your children have special needs. Carpenter’s mother lives with the family and helps with childcare. Even so, he can end up being pulled in more directions than he can manage at any one time – he wasn’t able to get to all the children’s nativity plays, because they attend different schools and the schedules clashed – but he is adamant that his parenting responsibilities are manageable. “I do find time for myself,” he says. In fact, he is considering adopting again. “It’s so rewarding to see a child – whose future is, in some cases, so bleak and dark – flourishing into a child who is thriving and cared for.”Carpenter receives an adoption allowance and child benefit, but still has to budget carefully each month to make ends meet. Indeed, using a surrogate from abroad is an option only for well-off people: the majority of Zadeh’s research cohort who used surrogates had high incomes. “I feel so privileged to have been able to do this,” says 54-year-old Simon Burrell, an educational manager from Brighton. His son, William, was born to a US surrogate late last year. William’s birth was dramatic – he was born two weeks early, on Boxing Day, meaning that Burrell had a mad rush to get to the US and missed the birth. Meeting his son for the first time felt wonderful, he says, but was less overwhelming than he had expected. “I felt like I knew him already,” he says. “I didn’t have that feeling of being overcome or in tears. I was his only parent, he needed me, and I was already a day and a half late getting there.”As we speak, William is sleeping in another room in Burrell’s rented apartment in California he is waiting for William’s paperwork to come through so he can bring him home. Burrell estimates that the surrogacy process, which was arranged through the British agency Brilliant Beginnings, cost about £200,000. Burrell funded it through the sale of his home in London. “It’s unfair that other men who would also be good fathers can’t do this, but they don’t have the option.”Adoption and fostering are alternatives for which you don’t have to be wealthy, says Carpenter. “You can be from any walk of life, as long as you go through the process and are deemed to be a suitable person to adopt. There is no set adopter.” In addition, foster parents are eligible for financial allowances that adoptive parents don’t receive.“My own experience of fostering was that they were incredibly open to single fathers,” says Gareth K Thomas, 34, from south Wales. He has been fostering two boys, aged 13 and 10, and their seven-year-old sister since 2017. “The people going through your fostering application aren’t interested in your sexuality or your marital status. They just want to know that you’ll be a good parent to these kids.” He advises single men who want to foster to get experience of being around children – Thomas volunteered with the Scout Association.He has taken to fostering with great happiness – and relative ease. “Sometimes I have to pinch myself,” he says, laughing. “We go away for weekends, camping, take the dog for a walk, go for hot chocolate. I think: it’s my job to do this? Someone is going to find me out soon.” He hopes to encourage other single men to consider fostering. “The door is wide open,” he says. “That’s the message I would like to get across.”But not everyone’s experience of fostering as a single father is so positive. James, 39, a business owner from London, applied to become a foster parent in January 2018 after attending a fostering roadshow. “I’d wanted to do it for a while,” he says. “I didn’t have much desire to have kids of my own, because I thought it was better to sort out the kids we already had.” After being approved in November 2019, James was introduced to Carl, the 14-year-old he would be fostering.As a single carer, James expected support from foster services, but this was not to be the case. “All the promised support evaporated,” he sighs. It took 10 weeks for James to find Carl a school placement, meaning that he was unable to work. His finances began to unravel. He pleaded for more support from fostering services, to no avail. “I was going to them breaking down in tears.” Eventually, James had to end the placement. “The last thing I wanted to do was let this kid down, but that’s what ended up happening. It was really upsetting and stressful.” He wishes that the foster services had been more realistic about how much support they could offer. “I’d come to care about the kid to have to end the placement was horrible.”In a society that is set up to regard women as primary caregivers, being a single father can feel alienating. Zadeh says: “Men get questions asking whether it’s Mum’s day off.” Even in relatively progressive California, Burrell gets comments. “They say: ‘He’s so cute! How’s the mother?’”Single fathers can also be viewed with suspicion or seen as unfit parents. “People assume they can’t parent properly because they are male,” says Zadeh. Her research indicates that fathers are subject to greater scrutiny from healthcare visitors than mothers. “They’re seen as that bit more unusual,” she says. When Burrell told his friends about his plans to have a child, some questioned whether he was biting off more than he could chew. “We’re used to the idea of women as single parents, but there seems to be an assumption that men can’t do it on their own,” he says.Worse still is when people allege that single fathers are predators. Social media trolls have accused Carpenter of molesting his children. “They tell me that they hope I’m arrested for my crimes of abusing children, and that’s the only reason I wanted to adopt. They cannot cope with the fact that a man wants to love and care for children.” But Carpenter emphasises that those people are in a minority. “Nine out of 10 times, the feedback is so supportive and wonderful.”Mucklejohn has seen attitudes towards single fathers change since he became a parent. “In 2001, I was described as selfish, or undertaking a business transaction to get the children,” he says. Although no one writes about the family critically now, those years caused damage – Mucklejohn’s son Ian struggled to cope with the negative press. “It made him want to be invisible at school,” Mucklejohn says. “He kept a very low profile for fear someone would tap his name into a search engine.”As society becomes more accommodating of single-parent families, whether male or female, it is likely we will see more solo fathers on the school run. But there is still a way to go. “Whether, in 50 years, there will be such a societal shift that we see men doing most of the primary caregiving, I’m not sure,” says Zadeh. She points out that statutory maternity leave is up to 52 weeks, whereas statutory paternity leave is up to two weeks. (However, adoption leave is equivalent to maternity leave.) “These conditions would have to be levelled out before you saw more men taking on non-traditional roles.”About a week after William’s birth, the emotion finally came. Burrell had woken at 7am, fed the baby, made coffee and looked out at the beautiful mountain vista he can see from the window of his rented apartment. “It hit me,” Burrell says. “I’m his daddy. It’s real. This is how we’re going to be now, until he leaves home. That’s when it finally dawned on me.” He felt his heart expanding with love, and he was calm.Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c12ceb45733f603e5fcab326ad5ce8f667d26645/0_48_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc4371c5f7d4ecec2cead99ebdc5363b","title":"life story books adopted children","story":"Life story books can help adopted children understand their past, but are often not prioritised by social workersBaby Charlie* was unable to live with his birth family, but they were determined that he would know where he came from. Although it was sometimes painful, Charlie’s birth mother and his maternal birth grandparents all spent time sharing memories and anecdotes, and explaining what happened in their own words.Charlie’s mum also pointed out where his cot used to be (the glow in the dark stars were still visible on the ceiling) and his scan picture on the fridge, allowing me to take photos that his adopters can show him when he is older. The family shared many photos and a video.Charlie’s grandmother said: “It’s going to be a long time until we get a chance to see and talk to him as an adult, and so much better for him to read about us and feel secure about his origins and how much he was loved and cherished.”Growing up, most people’s narratives and identity are shaped by those around them, who carry their histories and their memories. Their parents might remember the first thing the midwife said when they were born. Older siblings might recall their first words or the fall that explains the scar still there on their top lip.Yet for children who don’t grow up in their birth families, many of these memories and their context can be lost. Poet Lemn Sissay wrote:Memories in care are slippery because there’s no one to recall them as the years pass. In a few months I would be in a different home with a different set of people who had no idea of this moment … This is how you become invisible.Life story books are a way to help adopted children understand their past and where they come from. The books should include information about birth family, when the child was born, previous foster carers and why they were adopted, as well as information about the here and now to help the child start and end their story in a place of safety. My job is to help families write and use these books.Sharing Stories was set up three years ago by specialist voluntary agency CCS Adoption to address this gap. Staffed by two experienced social workers, we are dedicated to gathering life story information, writing books and supporting adopters.Separate from the court process, we can spend time with a wide range of birth family members gathering information, pictures, objects and anything else they want to share. We then co-write the life story book alongside the adopters so they can have input into language and feel ownership of the book.Most children, if they get a book, tend to get just one but occasionally multiple stories are written, which can be used at different ages.Charlie’s adoptive mum said of his books: “I’ve cried a fair bit reading it. You’ve dealt with the sensitive issues so well, thank you for the time and care you’ve put into researching all the details and describing hard truths in a gentle way.

Even once?Kaepernick is relevant this year, and not just for his activities off the field. He was the 49ers quarterback the last time the team reached the Super Bowl, in 2013, and played a huge part in their success that season – it stands to reason he would be discussed when we look back at the team’s last title shot. But you’d be smart to emphatically place your money place on Kaepernick not getting a single mention on Sunday. After all, his name wasn’t uttered when 49ers running Raheem Mostert broke Kaepernick’s postseason rushing record during the NFC Championship game earlier this month, a game televised by Fox.The Super Bowl is supposed to be a national party, a raucous, lighthearted event consumed with family and plenty of food. It’s the league’s biggest opportunity to hide its many stains. Yet despite the NFL’s best effort to erase Kaepernick from the history books on Super Bowl Sunday (and every other day) his treatment both permeates the league and transcends it.It’s been more than three years since Kaepernick last played in the NFL. In August 2016, he was caught on camera sitting during the national anthem, his first rendition of a peaceful protest. After a conversation rooted in mutual respect with former Green Beret turned NFL hopeful, Nate Boyer, Kaepernick quickly reverted to kneeling.Kaepernick’s bold decision to use his platform to give a voice to the voiceless came on the heels of a slew of African Americans, such as Tamir Rice and Michael Brown, being fatally shot by police officers. He had also engaged in a deeper understanding of his own background.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he explained to reporters at the time. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”To Kaepernick, the national anthem and American flag did not just symbolize military greatness, they also represented a deeply unequal country dripping with racism. To the NFL, the national anthem and American flag mainly represent the armed forces. The star-gled optics have always been present in NFL stadiums but spiked when the league collected more than $6m in taxpayer money from the Department of Defense between 2011 and 2014. The league’s forced patriotism paired well with Donald Trump, who soon entered the fray and attacked Kaepernick with bombastic shots, such as the suggestion that he leave the country. Trump continued to brand Kaepernick and his supporters as un-American and turned protesting NFL players into a hot-button topic.Kaepernick’s protests were driven by a greater sense of purpose. And he knew the career risk. Though only 28, and just a few years removed from playing in the Super Bowl, he opted out of his 49ers contract, hopeful that he would become a prized free-agent. But NFL owners, many of them friendly with Trump, appeared to shut Kaepernick out of the league. At first, Kaepernick’s unemployment seemed strange, considering the need for talented quarterbacks, but as time passed the reality set in. It’s almost as if his opponents thought by banishing Kaepernick, we would somehow forget him.Boy, did they underestimate the fervidity and sheer size of Kaepernick’s supporters.In mid-2018, the NFL chose a new course of action when it entered the social justice space by funding the Players Coalition, a group of activist minded player that once included Kaepernick and his best friend, Panthers safety Eric Reid. The Players Coalition coordinates NFL athletes’ social justice efforts and works on policy issues such as bail reform. How much of the NFL’s funding was to quiet Kaepernick supporters rather than engage in genuine altruism is debatable. But as the I’m With Kap faction grew even stronger, for some the notion of doing any form of business with the NFL while Kaepernick remained unemployed was met with disdain.Kaepernick’s banishment is the reason artists like Cardi B and Rihanna have turned down the Super Bowl halftime show. It’s the reason the NFL’s partnership with Jay-Z, designed to amplify its social justice efforts, was instantly panned.The latest effort to quiet the Kaepernick crowd came in November when the NFL made an unprecedented move to host a workout for Kaepernick. He was finally going to get his big chance … or not. The workout was fraught with problems – Kaepernick had virtually no notice, it was to be held on a Saturday, when NFL teams prepare for Sunday games, and no one other than the NFL could film the session. Kaepernick switched locations at the last minute and livestreamed a workout starring a man who looked NFL-ready. Yet the league tried to brand Kaepernick’s rogue quest for transparency as the key issue.And now in perhaps its greatest act of hypocrisy yet, the NFL has released a PSA about Botham Jean, an unarmed black man who was fatally shot by an off-duty police officer. It’s a powerful story that sheds light on the continuing crisis of racial inequality. It’s also the exact type of story that Kaepernick got banned for bringing attention to.To this day, Kaepernick is said to wake up early to work out on the off chance an NFL franchise calls. He has spent much of his days working tirelessly on a slew of philanthropic projects. In the process, a once shy man has found his voice and embraced his role as a spokesperson for the unheard.The 49ers are striving for their sixth Super Bowl ring on Sunday. Fox will likely delve into the 49ers’ glory years and laud team greats such as Joe Montana and Steve Young. The NFL will surely hope Kaepernick’s name is not mentioned. Yet no matter how much energy is put into erasing Kaepernick from our memory, he will be far more remembered in 100 years than the vast majority who have ever played in a Super Bowl.

He has just dropped Thomas Muster, a former world No 1 and French Open champion, after a short spell working together.Speaking to the media after the match, Nadal said: “Hey, I was wondering if you know whether Rafa shook hands with the umpire after the match? Btw I’m not surprised by the result. Anyone who watches the clay court season knows Dominic was always going to do this to Rafa in time. He is younger. It amazes me how hard he hits it given his size. I assume it must be timing. Go Thiem.”Looks like a handshake happens just before just after the 8secs point in this clip … I get the sense that Nadal was infinitely more frustrated by the occasionally forgiving nature of the net cord than the umpire on this occasion.Here’s an early report from the match …Some more post-match comments from the Austrian:I think all the match was on a very good level, I think we were both on great form. We already had this epic match in New York two years ago.Today I was really feeling I was lucky in the right situations. The net cord was really on my side. He’s one of the biggest legends this sport’s ever had so you need some luck to beat him. I’m full of adrenaline, full of happy moments.”Some of the key stats from a gripping quarter-final …Courtside with Jim Courier, discussing the topsy-turvy fourth set, Thiem said:I just wanted to stay in the match. It was a special situation for me, serving for the match against Rafa. It’s such a mentally tough situation – I couldn’t handle it! But I turned it around in the tie-breaker.It’s a little bit ‘demons in the head’, as Roger has said. I was just rushing too much … changing my tactics. You have to deal with these situations almost every single game.”Cheers Tom, and blimey. Once again serial lunch-delayer Nadal made a two-set deficit look like the merest of blips, but Thiem managed to overcome some late-fourth-set jitters to see it out. Did anyone really think that was going to be a straight-sets victory for the world No 5? If anything it’s more of a surprise that it didn’t go to a fifth.Still, the Austrian progresses to a first Melbourne semi-final where he will face Alexander Zverev.Phew. That was quite the absorbing encounter, at which point I’ll pass the baton over to Stuart Goodwin to gauge some reaction and post-match analysis. Thanks.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem A fantastic crosscourt backhand pass from Thiem flicks the netcord again, but he deserved it for the shot’s stylish audacity. It’s another match point – and this time he’s got it, forced wide by Nadal’s return but keeping him pinned to the back of the court, and the Spaniard dumps it into the net to seal a superb win for Thiem. Rafa’s Melbourne angst goes on. What a display of steel and, at times, style this has been from the Austrian. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem Thiem loses his footing during another absorbing rally, but recovers swiftly and eventually has the point when Nadal pushes a backhand wide. Nadal makes no mistake next point to pull it back to 5-3, and prevails in another punishing rally to reduce the deficit to only one. A brilliant first serve from Thiem is then netted to give him two match points. But he chokes again! Thumping what his mind was doubtless telling him was a historic forehand winner into the net. He’s lost the mini-break. Then, strangeness, as Thiem’s lob is called in, Nadal half-heartedly challenges, and is vindicated, as it is indeed out. The Spaniard stays in the championship. Ah man, this is absurdly tense. Can Thiem regroup again?Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem They have to replay the point when the line judge is caught in two minds about a Thiem shot that initially looked heading out but wasn’t. And it continues to go against serve as Thiem’s aggressive tenacity induces an overhit forehand from Nadal. He then nets needlessly to put Thiem in the box seat again at 3-2. Can he make the next point count? He can, following one of the rallies of the match, settled with a low backhand volley that’s too good for his opponent.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem First blood in the tie-break to Thiem, forcing an error from the back of the court from Nadal to gain a mini-break, but he squanders the advantage by netting a lame angled drop shot, a wild backhand then gives Nadal the advantage.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem ( *denotes next server) If Thiem wins this match from here, it’ll reflect very well on his temperament. Rafa’s temparament, we know rather more about. And his talent of course, which manifests itself here in a stunning backhand volley on the stretch at the net for 0-15. Thiem responds well with a couple of fine first serves, and then gets some more net-cord fortune with a diagonal forehand that just plops over the net with Rafa beached. An effortlessly wonderful forehand down the line from Nadal makes it 40-30, but he overhits a return next point. Rafa’s what-the-hell challenge is ruled out and it’s a tie-break. Again.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-5 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Nadal, bit between teeth now, races to a 30-0 lead on his serve, though an overhit backhand grants Thiem the next point. The Spaniard then nudges Thiem around the court to induce a lame return to the net, but his opponent’s response is good, a steely forehand volley at the net taking it back to 40-30. But it can’t stop Nadal wrapping up the game with another strong wide first serve. Now Thiem must serve to save this set.Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 5-5 Thiem ( *denotes next server) And Rafa roars back. Thiem begins confidently, bullying a bouncing forehand down the middle past Nadal, but then the yips strike. The Austrian overhits a low return next point. Then, a horrible double-fault that can only be attributed to jitters – the second was a metre or so too long – and a cramped forehand into the net then hands Nadal two break points. A nerveless first serve saves the first of them, but not the second, Thiem overhitting a cross-court forehand. Nadal is back back back in this match.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 4-5 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Nadal cruises to 30-0 as if he hasn’t a care in the world, but then pushes a long forehand too wide following a brief rally. A slanting ace was never going to be reached by Thiem, who responds well by pressuring from the net on the next point and forcing the error for 40-30. But Nadal serves well and keeps the pressure on Thiem as he prepares to serve for the match and a fifth grand slam semi-final place. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 3-5 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Thiem begins with an ace but Nadal skilfully outlasts the Austrian in the next, very lengthy, point, eventually being offered an easy forehand pass at the net. A wonderful whipped forehand to the corner is Thiem’s response before Nadal nets a spinning backhand for 40-15. Thiem loses another challenge, when he erroneously queries a first serve out. He challenges on the next point too following a fine forehand down the line. And this proves to be a vital challenge, which he could easily have bottled. It’s in! He’s one game away from the semi-finals.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 3-4 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) The luck is with Thiem as one of those gruelling, nerveless rallies is more or less settled when a slight net-cord deflects the Austrian’s winner past a motionless Nadal, who then dumps a low forehand on the half-volley into the net for 0-30. An uncompromising serve wins Nadal the next point, and a forehand into the net from Thiemn then brings parity. Another decent serve from Nadal is returned out by his opponent, and the No 1 seed goes on to hold. He might not be broken again, so Thiem’s got to make his next two service games count.Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 2-4 Thiem ( *denotes next server) A lovely raking Thiem forehand is unanswerable at the back of the court for Nadal, but the Austrian overhits his next attempt at an expansive winger, pushing his diagonal forehand too wide. No matter, a glorious low forehand winner down the linen makes it 30-15, and a miscued return is then sent skyward by Nadal. Which is as good a time as any to send an ace down the middle to put Thiem two games away from a semi against Zverev.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 2-3 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Brilliant from Thiem, as - unperturbed by a potentially deceptive net-cord he manages to crown a brilliant rally with a lovely diagonal backhand that Nadal can’t handle. Strong serving and that trusty forehand swiftly take Rafa to 40-15 before a rare double fault, and a particularly poor one, but Nadal prevails following a nerveless long back-court rally to hold. This is still going to be a hell of a challenge for Thiem.Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-3 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Confident serve-volleying gets Thiem underway on his serve, and he eventually forces an overhit from Nadal during a long rally to take the next point too. Nadal pulls back to 30-15 before a booming, bouncing serve from Thiem is scooped off court by Nadal and beautifully caught one-handed by the umpire, Rafa’s mate. As easy a hold as Thiem has had for a while.Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-2 Thiem * ( *denotes next server) The importance of that previous hold is underlined as Thiem breaks! Earlier, he gets his challenge in to a line call earlier in the game rather quicker than Nadal did in the previous one, but it’s the wrong call. Nadal’s ace down the middle for 30-15 was in, unlike the crosscourt backhand in the next rally that gets Thiem back to 30-30. Thiem then outpoints Nadal around the back of the court to induce a mistake that gives him a break point, which he converts, Nadal slicing a whipped forehand too high and out of court. Is the top seed on his way out now?Fourth set: Nadal * 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-1 Thiem ( *denotes next server) A vital hold for Thiem, saving three break points. Thiem larrups a forehand drive-volley at the net past Nadal at the corner of the court to get underway, but a fine return makes it 15-15. An unforced error from Thiem ensues, and Nadal has two break points when the Austrian’s horribly soppy drop shot gives Nadal the initiative in the rally, which he consolidates on his next visit to the net with a volleyed winner. A better drop shot from Thiem saves the first break point while a much better first serve gives him the advantage in the rally that he smashes home the net for deuce. But then – agh! - he dumps another wayward forehand into the net to give Nadal another break point. It’s saved with a fearless diagonal forehand just inside the line. An ace down the line is challenged by Nadal, but too late. More grumpiness ensues, as do boos from the paying punters. A slugfest of a rally is then edged by Thiem to seal the game. How important might this be?Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-0 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) The old Nadal comes out now, as he begins the set with a remorseless grinding back-court rally that he never looks like losing it’s 30-0 when Thiem’s admirably ambitious top-spun passing shot goes out at the back of the court, but the Austrian’s flair is rewarded when he follows up an acrobatic return of serve with a glorious backhand crosscourt winner. Nadal’s strong first serve lands him the next point, before Thiem’s strong first return induces a miscued scoop from Nadal for 40-30. An overhit forehand from Thiem hands Nadal the game. You have to say Nadal looks the stronger of the two players now, but not by much.Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 6-4 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Suddenly Nadal looks to be more sprightly around the court, taking advantage of Thiem’s first-serve woes to boss an aggressive rally that ends with Thiem’s backhand straying over the line. Another fierce whipped forehand induces an error that takes Nadal to 0-30. Thiem responds with a timely ace. But Nadal continues to have the upper hand and earns two set points, the first of which is squandered with an overhit return of serve but the second – following another poor first serve – is not, and Nadal digs in during a lengthy rally to ensure that Thiem blinks first, sending a tame return into the net to reduce the deficit. It’s two sets to one. Is another big comeback by one of the big guns on the cards here?Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 5-4 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Nadal’s best service game for a bit nonetheless begins badly wh en he clatters a forehand into the net following a medium-length back-of-court rally before Thiem errs when hitting his forehand return too far wide, perhaps deceived by the bounce. Nadal finally gets a rally he control that ends with his opponent netting from miles back. A slightly wayward return makes it 40-15 before Nadal bosses another rally to wrap up the game. We’re at a big pressure point now, for both players. And it’s a big test of Thiem’s cool, with the prize so near yet seeming so far.Third set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 4-4 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Thiem’s easiest service game of this set begins when a lovely crosscourt forehand is whizzed past Nadal to get Thiem’s service game underway, and it’s followed by an easy smash for 30-0. Thiem serve-and-volleys effortlessly for 40-0, pushing Nadal back and around the court, and a scuffed forehand out of the lines by Nadal gives Thiem the game.Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 4-3 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Thiem misjudges an inviting back hand opportunity down the line to get Nadal underway in his fourth service game of the set, which the Spaniard follows up with a booming serve for 30-0, but Thiem wins the next point after pushing Nadal to the back of the court and inducing a backhand error. Other than that, Nadal’s serve is too strong – it’s the part of his game that’s looking strongest at present – and he wraps up another fairly, but not totally, comfortable hold.Third set: Nadal* 6-7 6-7, 3-3 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Nadal slashes his forehand return to start Thiem’s service game, but the Austrian then serves up a third double-fault. Again, his first-serving is a little awry, as is his volleying, when he ends a long rally by approaching the net and overhitting a too-tricky low volley. A couple of forceful first serves make amends to put him 40-30 up before a gruelling rally finally ends with Nadal slightly overhitting down the line to seal the game. Excellent defensive focus from Thiem.“Nadal is giving the ball girls an unbelievably bad time,” writes Christine Herbert. “Seems to have been on at them all match. Shockingly out of his usual behaviour. Think descriptions don’t convey that... this is more than tetchy or fidgety, it is downright rude bullying, and the umpire should pull him up for it.”Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 3-2 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) “This match feels like at least a semifinal match or even a FINAL match,” says Lela in the US. “Impressive games played by both players that I haven’t caught any moment of sleep but glued to the television. Regardless of who wins this, they should both be proud and walk out with their head held high. I have to add though that in the past two sets, Thiem’s past experience with Nadal in the French Open Final might have helped here in reading Nadal’s shots.” Nadal races to 40-0 in no time, then seals the game with a diagonal ace. Suddenly, that was very easy for the No 1 seed.Third set: Nadal* 6-7 6-7, 2-2 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Thiem finds this one tougher, struggling to land his first serve, but he toughs it out. He starts by erring after a long rally, miscuing an awkward backhand volley at the net out, but he hits back to end a long exchange of back-court slugging with a wrongfooting forehand to make it 15-15. More smart court-manouevring sets up Thiem for a crosscourt forehand winner but Nadal hits back when Thiem mishits a forehand that comes onto him quicker than expected. A beautiful under-pressure backhand down the line is Thiem’s wonderful response, and that sets him up to hold.Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 2-1 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Another hold that was never in doubt. Nadal cruises to 30-0 before lazily dumping a volley into the net. Forceful serve and volley action lands Nadal the next point before he steers Thiem all around the back of the court in a lengthy rally that eventually induces an error and wraps up another comfortable hold. But there’s more fidgety agitation and chatter from Nadal at the changeover he’s apparently unhappy with the air flow inside the arena.Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 1-0 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Thanks Jonathan. It’s tense here, even with Thiem two sets up and deservedly so, and Nadal tetchier than usual. The Spaniard duly starts the third set with an unremarkable and comfortable service hold to 15.Ok, to see you through the remainder of the match it’s Tom Davies.Second set: Nadal 6-7 6-7 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal tries to drop but the execution has way too much height and a man as rapid as Thiem has no problem gobbling it up for two set points. He only needs one! A net cord lands his way meaning Nadal can only pat a gentle backhand in Thiem’s direction. The Austrian has time to pick his spot and power home in exuberant fashion.Second set: Nadal 6-7 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) After the change of ends a good first serve from Nadal brings him back to just one point behind, then Thiem hits wide mid-rally under no pressure - and we’re back on level terms! If the Austrian is feeling the occasion he hits his way out of his anxiety with that glorious inside-out forehand to inch ahead once again, but we’re back on serve. Second set: Nadal 6-7 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) Thiem has a clear mind, coming in behind another first serve to move up 4-0 at the net. Nadal scrambles tenaciously to claw back one of those mini-breaks then his opponent loses focus, ripping a forehand into the net way before he needed to pull the trigger. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal is edgy. He doesn’t commit to the opening point then he’s too conservative at 0-15 and Thiem’s Matrix-like shot pre-emption makes him pay both times. He claws back a point then goes for the money shot, pounding a forehand into the corner from a deep Thiem backhand. Thiem responds in kind though, hustling the Spaniard then mugging him with a backhand on the run into unguarded territory. The crowd lifts. And Nadal follows, saving set point with a one-two serve-forehand combo that’s too hot even for Thiem’s astonishing pace. Deuce doesn’t last long then Nadal holds, improbably, with a backhand clipping the outside of the line after Nadal asked for a review.To another tiebreak we go. Second set: Nadal 6-7 5-6 Thiem* (* denotes server) While Nadal is fighting his demons Thiem is quietly returning to his form of the opening set and eases up 30-0 with some blistering groundstrokes. Nadal pins a point back in possibly the point of the match - heck, maybe even the point of the tournament - full of amazing court coverage, shot selection, power, and precision. You can tell by the sound sometime, the venomous pop off the racket followed by squeaks from the sneakers on the court. But that’s as good as it gets for Rafa, Thiem lands a couple of first serves and he’s guaranteed at least another tiebreak. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 5-5 Thiem (* denotes server) “12 points to five in favour of Dominic Thiem since the time violation” Lleyton Hewitt says on TV. That quickly becomes 12-7 when the No 1 seed nails a couple of serves but he hands both points back soon after when he slaps consecutive forehands wide. 30-30 feels tense the crowd hushed but Rafa does enough to provoke a backhand error from Thiem, then thunders down his second ace of the game for a very valuable hold.“Regarding the watch,” emails Shervin Abdolhamidi, “he’s been wearing that for the past 5-6 years at least. He gets paid a tremendous amount of money for it, but it weighs next to nothing, which is why it doesn’t seem to bother him. But I was surpirsed when he started wearing it as well.”Nadal is blowing up on the changeover. This time it’s about the aircon unit at his chair not working properly. Second set: Nadal 6-7 4-5 Thiem* (* denotes server) Energised by Nadal’s gift giving Thiem puts his pedal to the metal and scorches to 40-0, showcasing a return to serving form. Nadal then pushes a backhand wide to drop the game and he stomps off to his chair wrestling a few demons. Huge service game coming up for the Spaniard. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 4-4 Thiem (* denotes server) Here we go. Thiem streaks to 0-30 with a couple of winners - the first ending a powerful point, the second a fortunate stretch that just lands inside the baseline. Nadal then dumps a sloppy forehand into the net to face three break points. And he gives it up with a double fault! That was a poor double too, his second serve hitting midway up the net. Nadal is rattled. He engages the match referee, perhaps still bothered about the earlier time violation. Second set: Nadal 6-7 4-3 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem holds a scrappy game to 30. “I notice Nadal is wearing a wristwatch - while playing a major quarterfinal!”  emails an incredulous Robin Prior. “How much do you think he’s getting paid to do that, or is he wearing it by choice?” Nadal is so meticulous it’s impossible to believe he would do anything that was not in accordance with what he believes is in the best interests of his game. However, a quick Google suggests he sports a timepiece that retails at $725,000. So probably a little column a, a little column b. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 4-2 Thiem (* denotes server) The first long exchange in some time arrives at 15-15, and it ends Thiem’s way, the Austrian repelling some massive topspinning forehands from Nadal before edging into court and fizzing that majestic backhand down the line. Another scintillating rally follows, bang, bang, bang, like a shooting range, from one corner to the other, each man giving his all to hang in the point until Nadal finds the winner. “You don’t like good tennis” Nadal bemoans to the umpire after he receives a time violation.

Now, he thinks it’s here to stay.“That overwhelming sense of mortality is the hardest, biggest thing that I suspect I’ll be spending the rest of my life really wrestling with,” Ohanian, 36, says. The multimillionaire venture capitalist is speaking from Palm Beach, Florida, where he is working from home, having just collected Olympia, now two, from “school”.The US is one of only three countries in the world not to have any federally mandated parental leave, and the vast majority of American workplaces do not offer it.But things were different for Ohanian, who was able to take 16 weeks’ paid paternity leave from his then employer Reddit (he now works full time for Initialized Capital, an early-stage venture capital fund which he also co-founded).“I couldn’t imagine going through that as a husband and having to decide or even think for a second about choosing between your wife and your career. That is an inhumane choice to expect someone to make in a modern society.”The experience had such a profound impact on Ohanian that he has since become a prominent voice in the US on fatherhood and an advocate for a national paid family leave law.“My wife and I … we have means, we run our own careers, we have family, we have literally every advantage we could ask for when a newborn shows up, and yet still it was such a traumatising period,” he says.Williams, 38, narrowly escaped with her life when she suffered a pulmonary embolism after giving birth by emergency C-section. Following multiple operations, she was bed-bound for the first six weeks of Olympia’s life and many of the childcare duties fell to Ohanian. He had never held a baby before.“I learnt how to do a diaper and I learnt how to do all these things and just get comfortable with this tiny little person that I was now responsible for.”That crash course gave him the self-belief to handle future challenges. “I feel a confidence and a calm that is a direct result of having that time early when I had no fucking clue what was happening. But I figured it out and it worked.”From the beginning he has shared his experiences of fatherhood on social media, which he believes is uniquely placed to normalise fathers as caregivers and undo negative stereotypes such as the “Homer Simpson incompetent dad”.He believes a culture change is under way – evidence of which he claims can be found in his social media feed and group chat which he says is full of “dads doing dad things”.As more high-profile US figures take time off for the birth of their children, such as Chance the Rapper and the baseball player Daniel Hudson, Ohanian says, there has been “a bigger sea change in perception around fatherhood, around masculinity”.Ohanian and co-founder Steve Huffman started Reddit after graduating from the University of Virginia in 2005 and sold it the following year for a reported $10m to $20m. It’s now one of America’s most popular websites.He says a big part of encouraging men who have access to paternity leave to take it is about redefining what male success looks like. “These things are not mutually exclusive. A man can be just as career-driven, just as passionate, just as effective whether or not he takes time off to be with his family when welcoming a new child.”Ohanian says he did not consider the practicalities of paternity leave until he was about to become a father. When Reddit first introduced its policy he thought it was “reasonable” but admits he did not compute its significance.“It wasn’t until a couple of years later when I was using the policy that I realised this is indispensable and it’s something that a lucky few get access to in America, that really everyone should.”Last year, he went to Washington DC with other fathers to meet with members of Congress to talk about the issue as part of Dove Men+Care’s Pledge for Paternity Leave. He says they “came away from that trip feeling pretty optimistic because everyone there on both sides of the aisle agreed that this is something that we need”.The biggest questions, he says, were around how to fund it, but that he is “glad we’re already at that part in the conversation”. He also takes hope from recently passed legislation entitling 2.1 million federal workers to 12 weeks of paid parental leave.Ohanian will not single out which of the multiple proposed bills on family leave he supports, but in terms of paying for it, he thinks the paid family leave policies that have been introduced in some states – through an insurance fund model – could work nationally. While in an ideal world he would like to see new parents get six months off, he appreciates that may be ambitious.Having lost his mother to brain cancer, he would ultimately like a family leave bill to include time for caring for sick relatives. “I knew what it was like in my early 20s to have to take care of a dying and really debilitated parent and luckily, again, I was an entrepreneur and so I could build the schedule that I wanted to build and I had that flexibility, but the reality is not many people have that.”In the absence of a national law, private companies, especially in the tech industry, are increasingly offering paid family leave as an employee benefit. When Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced his leave after the birth of his second daughter, he took it as an opportunity to publicise the company’s four-month policy.Ohanian, who excitedly refers to the competition between companies on parental leave as an “arms race”, predicts that in the next 10 years, as demand for tech talent rises across other industries, more companies will start offering it.It’s also valuable for employee retention and productivity. “My instinct here is that yes, an employee will be more productive if they have some sense of peace over how their castle is doing, how their home is doing.”Initialized Capital offers 16 weeks’ paid parental leave. Last year, a quarter of their employees – including three fathers – took it. Ohanian, who refers to himself as a “business dad”, has also started investing in “family tech” companies like The Mom Project, a recruitment service for mothers, and the childcare app Kinside.To get to gender equality, though, he says it’s essential that men take as much parental leave as women. “No matter who’s getting pregnant, if both parents are taking leave then it sort of nullifies that penalty for having a uterus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0493ee05953c194f7bd0f1f23a12693064c671d/0_55_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4964d90d80df9689aaa4170d0841754","title":"harvard professor accused of lying about ties with chinese government","story":"A Harvard University professor has been charged with lying about his ties to a Chinese-run recruitment program and concealing payments he received from the Chinese government for research.Charles Lieber, the chair of the department of chemistry and chemical biology, is accused of hiding his involvement in China’s Thousand Talents Plan, a program designed to attract people with knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property to the country.Lieber was arrested at his office at the Ivy League university early on Tuesday, officials said. He remained in federal custody after a brief court appearance later in the day, pending a detention hearing scheduled for Thursday. A message seeking comment has been left with his attorney.Authorities also announced charges against a researcher at Boston University, who is accused of lying about her ties to the Chinese military. Yanqing Ye, who prosecutors allege is a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army, worked on behalf of the military while studying at the university, such as conducting research and sending documents and information to China, officials say.There was no attorney listed in court documents for Ye, who is now in China.Massachusetts US attorney Andrew Lelling called the charges “a small sample of China’s ongoing campaign to siphon off America’s technology and knowhow for its country’s gain”.“No country poses a greater, more severe or long-term threat to our national security and economic prosperity than China,” said Boston FBI agent Joseph Bonavolonta. “China’s communist government’s goal, simply put, is to replace the US as the world superpower, and they are breaking the law to get there.”Under Lieber’s Thousand Talents programme contract, prosecutors say, he was paid $50,000 a month by the Wuhan University of Technology in China and living expenses up to $158,000. He was also awarded more than $1.5m to establish a research lab at the Chinese university, prosecutors said.In exchange, prosecutors allege, Lieber agreed to publish articles, organise international conferences and apply for patents on behalf of the Chinese university, among other things.Lieber has been placed on administrative leave, Harvard officials said.“The charges brought by the US government against Prof Lieber are extremely serious. Harvard is cooperating with federal authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, and is conducting its own review of the alleged misconduct,” the school said in a written statement.Last month a medical student from China was also charged in Boston with trying to smuggle vials of research specimens to China in a sock in his suitcase. Zaosong Zheng, who was in the US on a visa sponsored by Harvard, is accused of stealing the materials from a lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.Zheng was held without bail by a judge, who ruled he was a flight risk. His attorney, Inga Bernstein, said in an email on Tuesday that they were “looking forward to a jury trial so our client can be found not guilty”.“All of them were either directly or indirectly working for the Chinese government at our country’s expense,” Bonavolonta said of Lieber and the others who had been charged.The cases underscore Justice Department concerns about Chinese programmes that recruit scientists with access to cutting-edge technology in the US and encourage them to conduct research for Beijing’s gain and even to steal the work of American academics.In recent years, according to a Senate subcommittee report issued last autumn, the programs have been exploited by scientists who have downloaded sensitive research files before returning to China, filed patents based on US research, lied on grant applications and failed to disclose money they had received from Chinese institutions.The Associated Press, relying on hundreds of pages of documents obtained through public records requests, reported last year that the FBI had been reaching out to colleges and universities across the countries to warn them of the threat of economic espionage on their campuses."},{"url":null,"title":"paternity leave us policy","story":"The most generous countries for paid leave for fathers are Japan, South Korea and Portugal, according to the Unicef reportWhile paid paternity leave (a period of absence offered for new fathers) is usually shorter than maternity leave, it is often better paid, with 16 countries offering full pay for those on average earnings.As attitudes change and countries increasingly start to recognise its importance, access to paid paternity leave is improving. The number of countries with statutory paternity leave provisions globally rose from 40 to 94 between 1994 and 2015, the International Labor Organization found.The most generous countries for paid leave for fathers are Japan, South Korea and Portugal, according to the Unicef report. The least is the US – the only country analysed not to offer any kind of paid leave to mothers or fathers.Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show the average length of paid leave reserved for fathers among its members is 8.1 weeks.Here’s a look at paid leave for fathers around the world.There is no stipulated paternity leave in Australia and parental leave – 18 weeks paid at minimum wage (A$741, or about $508, a week before tax) – automatically goes to the mother unless she opts to transfer it over to the father. But “dad and partner pay” gives new fathers and partners of mothers two weeks’ pay, also paid at national minimum wage, for taking unpaid leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e67c0d0ce72d815c1f89136430307fa181ebb5/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0af91e5e820f97f4fcc03e7a9528af5","title":"france moves to ban mass live shredding of male chicks","story":"Agriculture minister announces an end to cruel mass culling method, and castration of piglets without anaesthesiaFrance has said it will ban the controversial but widespread practices of live-shredding male chicks and castrating piglets without anaesthesia, in a move cautiously welcomed by animal welfare activists.Some 7 billion male chicks, unwanted because they provide neither meat nor eggs, are culled around the world every year. Many are ground up alive, others are gassed, electrocuted, or asphyxiated in plastic bags.France will be one of the first countries to ban the mass culling of chicks using any of these methods, starting next year.“From the end of 2021, nothing will be like it was before,” agriculture minister Didier Guillaume said on Tuesday in Paris as he announced the measure long demanded by campaigners.Guillaume said he hoped a method would be found soon that would allow farmers to determine the gender of a chicken embryo in the egg before it hatched. Researchers have been working on devising a viable method for years, but to date, the science requires each egg to be pierced to take samples – a technique that is not economically viable on an industrial scale.Switzerland banned chick shredding in September last year, though it was a rare practice among Swiss poultry farmers.Germany, where 45 million male chicks are macerated each year, outlawed it too, but a top administrative court ruled in June that the slaughter could continue until a method was found to determine the sex of an embryo in the egg.France and Germany announced last November they would work together to put an end to the chick massacre. An EU directive from 2009 authorises shredding as long as it causes “immediate” death for chicks less than 72 hours old.Also from next year, Guillaume announced, France would require anaesthesia be given to piglets being castrated.Neutering is done to encourage slaughter animals to grow fatter and prevent a potent smell said to emit from the fatty meat of non-neutered boars.France prides itself on its meat and poultry industries, but there have been growing tensions in recent years between producers and activists calling for radical changes in farming methods.A series of French butcher shops have been vandalised by activists who say eating meat is an immoral violation of the rights of other species.The Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) animal lobbying group said the real aim should be to stop the castration of piglets altogether, and expressed disappointment that Guillaume did not announce a ban on eggs from cage-raised chickens.For its part, the French L214 group which opposes all meat consumption, said the measures were “not ambitious” and “do not address the basic problems”. “There is nothing on slaughter conditions, nor on how to exit from intensive animal farming,” it said.Guillaume said agriculture ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday decided to put in place a responsible husbandry labelling system on all European animal-based products, starting next year.An opinion poll in January found that three-quarters of French people did not believe the government was doing enough for animal protection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ec502892bf51eb7666aa17b03004d1cdf40553e/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39daca5c38d4b31fd80ea7dd28ffb884","title":"our worst nightmare uk family face being split up as coronavirus evacuations begin","story":"Sindy Siddle, who has a Chinese passport, told she cannot leave with her husband and childA British family trapped in the centre of the coronavirus outbreak are facing their “worst nightmare” after being told wife and mother Sindy Siddle will not be allowed on the plane evacuating them from the country.Siddle travelled to Hubei province with her husband, Jeff, and nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, to spend lunar new year with her family in the village of Hongtu.The UK Foreign Office (FCO) has told her that since she has a Chinese passport, she will not be allowed to board the plane evacuating British nationals in the next few days. China does not recognise dual nationality any citizen who wants to get a passport from another country has to give up their Chinese one. Many people unofficially managed to hold two passports, by acquiring a second nationality without informing Chinese authorities. But in recent years, driven partly by an anti-corruption campaign, there have been greater official efforts to crack down on dual nationals.A 42-year-old accounts assistant, Siddle has had a visa for permanent residency in the UK since 2008.“My head is spinning. It’s just horrendous,” said Jeff Siddle, 54, an IT software developer. “This ordeal just turned into our worst nightmare … How can they put a family in this position? Having to leave Sindy in China would be the worst thing that anyone could be put through. How am I going to tell Jasmine that her mum has to stay behind?”Sindy Siddle said she was devastated when she found out: “This is a very difficult time for us because my daughter is just nine years old and I don’t want to put her at risk staying here for a long time. But anything that can help my daughter get away we will try, so we made a decision that Jeff and Jasmine will go.“I want to be with my family and look after them, especially my daughter, because I don’t know how to tell my daughter, you have to go without mum.”The family, from Prudhoe, Northumberland, said there were no health warnings in place when they flew out on 15 January, but they have since become caught up in an outbreak which has claimed more than a hundred lives.“There was no indication that there was any danger. It’s all just escalated since we arrived,” said Jeff.The Siddles’ situation was echoed by another family. Natalie Francis, a 31-year-old kindergarten teacher from York, said she had been told her three-year-old son, who has a Chinese passport, would not qualify for evacuation.“They said anyone with Chinese nationality or other citizenship is not being allowed to go on. And then he went on to ask if I still want to go, and I’m like, ‘So yeah, you want me to just abandon my son in China, and go home?’“He was probably just trying to do his job but it’s a ridiculous question.”The Siddles are trapped in the village of Hongtu near Jingmen city, a three-hour drive from Wuhan, with no communication over the last few days from the British authorities in Wuhan and Beijing, which Jeff Siddle said had been closed for the lunar new year. Other British citizens in Wuhan have expressed frustration over the lack of clarity from the UK government.“There hasn’t been a lot of help from the UK side at all,” he said. “The roads from our village are not allowing cars through, so we effectively can’t leave the village. We haven’t left the village for about four days now.”The family finally received confirmation that a flight would be available for British nationals to leave the country in the next few days, but still face the task of making their way to Wuhan airport, 150 miles away, when most roads are closed.The FCO said it would make a note on its file that Sindy is the mother of a British child, but could make no guarantees about her evacuation.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 27 January, the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 2,700 cases and 56 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the more than 70 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Foreign Office is urgently exploring options for British nationals to leave Hubei province. Details are being finalised, and the FCO will confirm these as soon as they can.”The FCO advised Britons in Hubei to ring one of two dedicated 24-hour telephone numbers before 11am on Wednesday to register their desire to be evacuated.The family are determined to campaign to get the decision overturned so that Sindy will be allowed to leave. In the meantime, they do not know when they will be reunited again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2050347cf7fd43d8c6d909f62d468c7dc6d47e/0_185_5397_3238/master/5397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4081079042159a960c047d31b63825ee","title":"vanessa nakate interview climate activism cropped photo davos","story":"Nakate was cropped from a photo with white activists. Now she’s battling for ersity in environmental activismWhen Vanessa Nakate addressed a tweet to the Associated Press asking why she had been cropped out of a photo, it was out of curiosity. She didn’t think her question would ignite a firestorm of criticism and spark an international conversation on erasure and ersity within the environmental movement.“When I saw the photo, I only saw part of my jacket. I was not on the list of participants. None of my comments from the press conference were included,” she said. “It was like I wasn’t even there.”The 23-year-old Ugandan activist had appeared at a joint press conference in Davos with other prominent climate activists, including Greta Thunberg, Loukina Tille, Luisa Neubauer and Isabelle Axelsson.But when the news agency published a picture of the event, Nakate had been cut from the image – which showed only the four white activists. Speaking up catapulted Nakate into an unfamiliar territory of social activism: calling out anti-black discrimination and racism. After experiencing “the definition of the word” for the first time in her life, she received messages of support. She said she now felt a greater responsibility to “amplify their voices”.After a wave of outcry, the cropped photo was replaced on the AP wire, and the agency apologized to Nakate, both publicly and in person. “We train our journalists to be sensitive to issues of inclusion and omission. We have spoken internally with our journalists and we will learn from this error in judgment,” said the AP’s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, in a statement.The agency said that the crop was an honest mistake with no ill intent, but Nakate was skeptical.“They changed the photo to where I was in the middle. That means they had other photos and chose to use that one,” she said. “So no, I don’t believe their statement or their apology.”And what some dismiss as an error, she said, reflects the constant silencing of erse voices in climate action groups.Nakate was among dozens of youth activists globally who convened for a weekend of workshops and panels. But media coverage of the event didn’t show the ersity of those who attended. Nakate only learned of the crop after struggling to find images that included her.Jamie Margolin, founder of the climate action group Zero Hero, said this exclusion of activists of color was part of a culture of silencing marginalized communities disproportionately affected by the climate crisis.“Racism, classism and the erasure of marginalized voices isn’t new,” she said. “A photo crop-out is an easy way to describe it but it’s really a metaphorical crop-out from the narrative of climate science in general.”Margolin recalled instances when activists were left out of clips, transcripts and other coverage of events – even those they had organized.While Margolin was initially surprised to hear it was Nakate’s first experience with racism, she said growing up in Uganda may have shielded her from the discrimination minority activists often face elsewhere.“Many of us haven’t spoken out because it isn’t unusual to us,” she said. “Environmental activism has been framed as Europe influencing the world – not the other way around. We’ve become used to our perspectives being excluded.”Climate researchers say that poor, mostly minority communities will face the brunt of the climate crisis, making their presence and power within activist circles vital.Dr Robert Bullard is widely considered the “father of environmental justice”, introducing the discipline in the early 1980s to “dispel the myth or misconception that African Americans and other people of color” don’t care about climate science. He said the cropping incident was “a symptom of a larger pathology” that isn’t “unique to climate or environmental fields”.“Climate activism among youth is perceived by the larger society as a ‘white thing’. The un-cropped photo didn’t fit the model,” he said. “Racism has the intended purpose of making people of color invisible.”A Kampala native, Nakate is the founder of the climate action groups Youth for Future Africa and the Rise Up Movement. She drew inspiration from Thunberg in leading a strike outside the Ugandan parliament to protest against climate inaction and rising temperatures. Nakate has also campaigned for climate initiatives across the continent, including protecting rainforests in Congo.Her Twitter question prompted responses from other black, Latinx and indigenous activists, all expressing their own frustrations at being erased in favor of white counterparts.“As much as this incident has hurt me personally, I’m glad because it has brought more attention to activists in Africa,” she said. “Maybe media will start paying attention to us not just when we’re the victims of climate tragedies.”As a white Latina, Margolin said she understood she had often toed a line between inclusion and exclusion. She recalled instances when she was both “the white girl left in” a photo or “the Latina left out”.

Photograph: Chinatopix via APPreparations are under way to evacuate Irish citizens trapped in the Chinese region at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.As the death toll in China reached 82, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was exploring options, “including commercial options”, for assisting Irish citizens to leave Hubei province, “if required”.However, the offer poses a dilemma for those in the stricken city as their Chinese partners would be left behind and anyone leaving would face another period under quarantine once they got out of the affected area.“The Embassy is in contact with Irish citizens in Hubei province regarding their intentions,” a spokeswoman told The . It is estimated there are eight Irish citizens in the affected region, which has been in effective lockdown since the Chinese authorities imposed severe transport restrictions in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.On Monday, the mayor of Wuhan, in Hubei, acknowledged criticism of his handling of the crisis, and offered to resign. There is growing anger among residents that they were not informed earlier about the risk posed by the outbreak, which is thought to have begun in December.The number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3,000, with 400 of these critical. The number of suspected cases now stands at more than 5,700, but experts believe thousands more could eventually be infected.Stocks markets tumbled worldwide yesterday following concerns about the possible economic impact of the coronavirus.ConcernMembers of the Chinese community in Ireland have expressed concern about the presence here of a tour party from the region of the country where the coronavirus originated.The group left China before restrictions were imposed on travel there, came to Britain and then travelled on to Ireland on the ferry from Holyhead at the weekend. Chinese social media posts show a woman member of the group posing at various landmarks, including Trinity College in Dublin and the Titanic Centre in Belfast. “We are the only tour from Wubei that can travel in UK. That’s not easy,” the woman posted on Weibo, a social media site. She also posted a picture from the Holyhead ferry, on which members of her group had played poker.While there is no evidence the group posed any health threat, its presence in Ireland prompted criticism on Chinese social media. One poster warned the community in Ireland, and in particularly Chinese restaurants, to “be aware” of their presence.Surgical masksMedical suppliers are reporting a big jump in demand for surgical masks in response to the coronavirus outbreak in China, with some Dublin stores saying they have run out of stocks.Demand has been particularly high among the Chinese community, especially from those who travelled home to mark the Chinese New Year at the weekend.The Department of Health said its National Public Health Emergency Team met on Monday to review the ongoing preparedness of the Irish health system for any cases of the virus that occur in Ireland. A statement gave no details of the group’s deliberations but pointed out that no confirmed cases had occurred here.Waterford Institute of Technology said one of its students was in self-isolation after travelling from Wuhan at the weekend.

Photograph: Cnsphoto via ReutersThe Department of Foreign Affairs updated its travel advice on Wednesday to Irish citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China, as the number of coronavirus deaths and confirmed cases continues to rise sharply.The Irish ambassador to China, Eoin O’Leary, advised the Irish community in China of the travel warning in an email on Wednesday.“We also advise that if you are thinking of leaving China, it would be better to do so sooner than later,” he said.“We are doing this primarily in case there are further restrictions on travel to, from or within China by the Chinese or other authorities.”The epidemic’s reported death toll jumped by 26 on Wednesday to 132.The number of confirmed cases of the rapidly spreading virus has hit 6,078, surpassing the number of cases China had in the Sars epidemic in 2002-03 that killed 774 people worldwide.Suspected cases also rose overnight by more than 2,000 to a total of 9,239, Chinese health officials said.The Irish embassy in China was not currently planning to evacuate staff, and the embassy were not warning citizens to leave, Mr O’Leary said.“I would stress that we are not advising people, who have no plans to leave China, to leave and we as an Embassy and Consulate team plan to remain in China on the basis that this current situation is not of sufficient seriousness to leave,” he wrote.On Wednesday, British Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China after the British Foreign Office also warned against “all but essential travel”.US and JapanThe United States and Japan on Wednesday flew citizens out of Wuhan, the city in Hubei province at the epicentre of the outbreak where the virus emerged last month in a wild animal market.The central province of about 60 million people is under virtual lockdown.“I was extremely worried that I was stuck there while the situation was changing very rapidly,” said Takeo Aoyama, who arrived in Tokyo on a chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals out of Wuhan, with more flights planned.“I feel really relieved,” Mr Aoyama, an employee of Nippon Steel who was wearing a mask, told reporters at the airport in the Japanese capital.Concern is also growing over the impact of the virus on the world’s second-biggest economy, with airlines cutting flights to China and global companies curbing employees’ travel there.Sectors from mining to luxury goods have been shaken by concerns about the possibility of a worst-case pandemic.Breakthrough?But in what could be a major step towards reining in the disease, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside China. They said they would share the sample with the World Health Organization and others.As infections spread and the number of cases rises, numerous countries are scrambling to get citizens out of Wuhan while, at the same time, hoping to keep the virus at bay.A US government official who declined to be identified told Reuters a US charter plane had left Wuhan. It had 220 people aboard, a US diplomatic source added, with 50 diplomats and contractors among them.Australia said it would help some citizens leave and then quarantine them on Christmas Island, a remote speck in the Indian Ocean best known for housing asylum seekers.US officials said the White House was weighing up whether to suspend flights to China in what would be a drastic measure to control the spread of the disease.“All options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions,” said US health secretary Alex Azar.TransmissionWhile some experts believe the new strain, known as “2019-nCoV”, is not as deadly as Sars, it has created alarm because it is spreading quickly and key features are still unknown, including its lethality.Like other respiratory infections, it is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes, with an incubation time from one to 14 days. There are signs it may also be able to spread before symptoms show.Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, is racing to build two dedicated hospitals for victims, with the first 1,000-bed facility to be completed on February 3rd. The second will have its capacity expanded to 1,600 beds from 1,300, the official People’s Daily said.Nearly 60 cases have been reported in 15 other countries, including the United States, France and Singapore. Airports around the world are screening passengers from China.Authorities in the southern German state confirmed on Tuesday evening the first known person-to-person transmission of the virus outside Asia. –Additional reporting Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153800.1580248276!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hong kong suspends chinese tourist visas as coronavirus spreads","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA health worker checks the temperature of a man entering the subway in Beijing, China. Photograph: Betsy JolesGetty ImagesHong Kong said on Tuesday it would stop issuing permits to mainland Chinese tourists and drastically reduce cross-border travel as the number of Wuhan coronavirus infections continues to soar.High-speed rail and cross-border ferry services to Hong Kong will be stopped, flights from the mainland will be cut in half, some border points will be closed and officials will suspend inidual travel visas for mainlanders, chief executive Carrie Lam said. The efforts to stem the spread of the deadly virus in Hong Kong, a city that was severely affected by the Sars epidemic in 2002-03, stopped short of the total shutdown that was demanded by several politicians and medical workers.Hong Kong has reported only eight cases of the virus to date, but the number of confirmed cases on the mainland is rising rapidly and the pathogen has spread to 17 countries and territories in recent days.Japan and Germany reported the first confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission outside of China on Tuesday. The UK foreign office later issued a statement advising against “all but essential” travel to mainland China due to the outbreak.The European Commission also said it would help fund two aircraft to fly EU citizens home from Wuhan, the city believed to be at the centre of the outbreak, with 250 French nationals leaving on the first flight.China announced 24 deaths on Tuesday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 106. The number of confirmed infections surged to 4,630, from less than 3,000 the previous day, the National Health Commission announced.An additional 7,000 cases are suspected and are awaiting confirmation, it said.The infection is believed to have originated in wild animals in a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where it jumped to humans before spreading rapidly.Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, isolating some 50 million people in an effort to contain the outbreak. With the number of fatalities and infections spiking, they then imposed a range of restrictions nationwide and on Tuesday urged its citizens to postpone overseas travel indefinitely. There are at least eight Irish nationals in the Hubei area under effective lockdown for the past six days. The Department of Foreign Affairs has contacted them and is exploring options to arrange an evacuation, if required.Staying putAt present, the members of the Irish community are opting to remain in China, including Liam Griffey from Ennis in Clare. “I’m staying put. I’m staying here because my girlfriend and the dogs are here. I don’t see why people would leave, especially if they have Chinese loved ones,” he said.He said he ventured out only to walk his dogs or make occasional trips to the supermarket, and apart from that his days are spent in his apartment with his girlfriend following the news, cooking, reading and watching movies.“I’m feeling pretty good about staying,” he said. “I’m enjoying the quietness – no ebikes and no ebike alarms, it’s great – but the days are starting to become a little humdrum.”Several countries, including the United States, France and Japan, are making arrangements to repatriate some of their citizens.World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is in Beijing to meet Chinese leaders, said he does not recommend the evacuation of foreign nationals from the affected areas, according to a report on Tuesday from the Xinhua news agency.The WHO had confidence in China’s epidemic prevention and control ability, the report said, and “called on the international community to remain calm and not overreact”.As Wuhan health officials battle on the frontlines, they have reported a chronic shortage of diagnostic kits, protective gear and hospital beds to deal with the viral outbreak.The city is building two prefabricated facilities and designating new areas in various hospitals to the coronavirus control efforts in the hope of making 10,000 additional beds available within a week “to boost the city’s overwhelmed health system”, an official said.On an inspection trip to the city, premier Li Keqiang said extra supplies and medical staff were being sent to the city, and he urged local officials to quickly make the extra beds available.“We must use every possible means to admit all the patients into a hospital,” he said. “We must fight resolutely to win the battle against the epidemic.” Additional reporting: Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4154924.1580280639!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany confirms four cases of coronavirus in bavaria","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A Kenyan health worker screens a passenger wearing face mask after they arrived  at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi from China.

Four employees have been infected, according to the Bavarian health ministry, at least 40 more employees are at risk and their health is being monitored.The first Webasto employee to fall ill is a 33-year-old man from the Landsberg region. He had close contact with a colleague from the firm’s Chinese operation visiting Bavaria for training. Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety, said the Chinese woman began to feel sick on the flight home on January 23rd.She sought medical attention, was confirmed to be carrying the virus that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The woman said she had visited her parents in the Wuhan region before the trip to Germany.A spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s centre for disease prevention and control, said the Bavarian cases appeared to be the first instance of a “human-to-human transmission” outside Asia.The four patients are being kept in an isolation ward at a Munich hospital and authorities say none have displayed any known symptoms.In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China “for at least the next two weeks”.The virus has so far killed over 100 people and infected more than 4,500 people in China.Cases have also been reported in a growing number of other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Japan. Germany’s federal health ministry has announced a series of precautions, operational from Wednesday. All airlines flying into Germany are required to register the health status of passengers after landing. In addition airlines have been asked to provide seating plans, to help contain any further outbreaks if required.Travellers will be issued with forms, requiring them to detail their travel and whereabouts in the last 30 days.

Faced with that humiliation, he’s clearly decided to go all in by using the week in which Britain leaves the EU to remind the neighbours that they’re minor league players compared to the 27-strong continental bloc, saying: “I don’t think the UK has yet come to terms with the fact it’s now a small country.”It’s no surprise that Varadkar  goes along with that tiresome chattering class cliché but making an issue of Britain’s “colonial history”, even if he had the self-awareness to look slightly sheepish as he did so, is not only uncalled for, but churlish. It’s certainly no way to talk to a country that Varadkar also referred to as an “old friend”.One of the few successes he’s had of late was helping get the withdrawal agreement over the line, which he managed to do by striking up a positive working relationship with Boris Johnson, thereby putting an end to a pernicious period during which relations between the two countries hit rock bottom. Suddenly, having quieted those ghosts, he decides for no good reason to raise them again.If the Taoiseach’s intention was to make himself appear indispensable to the next stage of talks, it’s too late. Irish voters are more concerned with record homelessness and a crumbling health system, and seem to have largely accepted that Brexit, while they might not like it, is happening. They’ve moved on.What’s really spooking Varadkar is the rise of Sinn Fein. The republican party has already seen off Labour, the traditional third wheel in Irish politics, and polls suggest they’re well placed this time to clip the wings of the two main centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.As it happens, polls always give Sinn Fein greater support than they achieve when real votes are cast. In last year’s local elections, the party only won nine per cent.But it’s inconceivable that the republican party won’t pick up seats in February, putting them in a strong position to demand a place in coalition. Both main parties have so far ruled that out, insisting Sinn Fein is unfit for government in Dublin, even as they demand it has an automatic place in government in Belfast but suspicions remain that a grubby deal might still be done.It’s not only younger voters with short memories who are being tempted by a party which still takes its orders from the IRA Army Council. Older voters who suffered during the financial crash also want change.Varadkar would appear to have decided the way to win back these disparate groups of the discontented is to stir the pot of nationalism and invite them all to take their minds off their woes by drinking deep from it. In all likelihood, that won’t wash either.Most of those inclined to vote for Sinn Fein are doing so because they’re attracted to the party’s populist, Corbyn-lite, “tax the rich” economics. That may prove a foolish gamble, but, like other disgruntled electorates around the world, Irish voters yearn for something to disrupt a status quo that isn’t working for them.If anything, rousing the ancient spectre of toxic nationalism will simply help Sinn Fein by normalising their Anglophobia. People in the Irish Republic always liked to boast that they were above the tribal hostilities of the North, but it hasn’t taken much recently to dredge it up again.Brit-bashing may have helped Varadkar domestically in those early post-referendum days, but, in trying to pull the same trick again, he’s just enabling forces which are much better at it than he is, and made himself look the smaller man into the bargain. Either that, or he’s already accepted defeat and is now just using the election to pitch for a plum job in Brussels.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Come on, Finalists, give us your best shot.Professor Beard’s new BBC Two series Shock of the Nude hasn’t even started yet, but already she’s throwing fig leaves to the wind. Professor Beard has told the Radio Times that far too many of the nudes we see on Western gallery walls are simply “Soft porn for the elite.” She asks how a modern woman should look at such paintings. Faced with a come-hither Titian or Hello-Boys Boucher, the female gallery visitor must ask herself: “On what terms can I enjoy looking at a naked woman whose image was drawn and painted, let’s imagine, for the pleasure of the male customer?” What you are absolutely not supposed to think is: I wish my Watteaus were as perky as hers.I joke. But I am troubled by the tendency to impose modern sensibilities on the classical and Renaissance past. Rather than stand in front of every shy Venus and brazen Bathsheba and purse our lips and sigh “problematic,” should we not try to see with sixteenth-century eyes?The art of looking demands a great imaginative leap. Leave the present. Think, see, read yourself into Urbino, Ferrara or Rome. I remember hearing a historical novelist admit to spending his weekends at costumed re-enactment festivals. It was only by wearing the soft-soled shoes of a medieval peasant, he explained, that he realised his hero couldn’t possibly run for his life over muddy fields. He’d have sunk. Understanding the past, down to the last bootlace, made every plot move more convincing. As gallery goers we have to do something similar.Think like a Greek sculptor, a Florentine master, a Pre-Raphaelite. Be the Duke, the Cardinal, the patron with money and power. Then, by all means be the wife, the model, the mistress. Play all the parts. Each is already more interesting than the modern me, me, me.The first part of Professor Beard\u0026#39s documentary airs on BBC Two on February 3I was amazed the first time I was told that the lovers in Rodin’s The Kiss were Dante’s Paolo and Francesca, caught in flagrante, and soon to be murdered by Francesca’s furious husband. Coming into the gallery, you become the husband and villain of the piece. A better role by far than “Outraged Feminist of W2”. The really radical thing is to learn enough to truly get under the skins of patron, painter and the girl who posed for Aphrodite.We’re in danger, too, of neglecting beauty. Take three of the current London blockbusters: Gauguin at the National Gallery, and Picasso and Freud at the Royal Academy. Of course one should understand context, of course we feel uneasy about child brides and bullied mistresses, but all the same: colour, light, line, style!While worrying if Rubens’ Graces were sufficiently enfranchised, it would be a shame if we forgot to notice that the landscape is glorious, the brushstrokes ine and the flesh so pink and peachy that man or woman, woke or an irredeemable bloke, you feel that if you were to reach out and stroke the canvas, the lovely bodies would still be warm.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The discovery of the crater, named\u0026nbspOccator, led some to speculate that it had been constructed by an alien civilisation – though it is most likely just an accident of light and shadow on the surface.In the new research, conducted by scientists from the\u0026nbspUniversity of Cadiz and published in the journal\u0026nbspActa Astronautica, participants were shown one of those mysterious formations on the planet\u0027s surface. They were then asked to describe what they saw, with many people pointing out the unusual formation.The scientists then did the same with an artificial intelligence system, which had been trained to spot squares and triangles in images. The AI also spotted the formations – and, once it had, it meant that participants also saw them too.Both people and artificial intelligence detected a square structure in the images, but the AI also identified a triangle, said Gabriel G\u0026nbspDe la Torre, the neuropsychologist who led the study.\u0026nbspAnd when the triangular option was shown to humans, the percentage of persons claiming to see it also increased significantly.The researchers said the study should warn those hunting for alien civilisations that the use of artificial intelligence could confuse us and tell us that it has detected impossible or false things. But it might also help us spot structures that would never have been noticed by humanity, he said,\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The world is watching to see if the UK and the EU can overcome the political hurdles around Brexit and secure a deal that makes economic sense.\u0026nbsp“With European economies facing significant economic headwinds, it is vital that policymakers keep a sharp weather eye on wider European competitiveness, and seek to maintain open and unfettered access to global capital markets through Europe’s primary international financial centre in the UK.”Separate research conducted by ZYen found that New York overtook London as the world’s top banking hub in September 2018 and extended its lead last year.Despite the increasingly bleak sentiment about London’s future, its financial sector is still expanding at a healthy clip, at least on some measures.The UK’s net exports of financial and related professional services grew by around 5 per cent to an estimated £82.8bn in 2018, up from £79bn in 2017.\u0026nbspIn currency markets, London has consolidated its dominant position, accounting for 43 per cent of global foreign exchange revenues last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Hundreds evacuated from Wuhan as coronavirus death toll rises to 132Apple has shut one store in China, he said, and reduced hours at others because of lower foot traffic, Cook said. Third-party stores that sell Apple products are also facing some closures, Cook said.Apple is forecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast, said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s no doubt about that.”London state school praised by Stormzy secures 51 Oxbridge offersMr Millward added: “I think there’s a real issue about capitalising on the talents across all parts of the country.“Nobody would say looking at the current profile of people going into the most selective universities that that reflects the talent and potential of students across the country.\u0026nbsp“This is really about improving opportunity for people who could benefit from that kind of education and don’t currently. That’s a fairness issue.”An Oxford University spokesperson said: “Greater competition inevitably means more students will be disappointed, but we want the best talent possible for the outstanding education we offer.”They added: “More than 69 per cent of undergraduate offers were made to pupils attending state schools, and a record number to those from under-represented backgrounds.“The changes we have brought in, with widespread support across the university and its colleges, have increased and ersified the pool of students applying to and receiving offers from Oxford.”Only a handful of black academics in top roles in British universitiesUK universities ‘increasingly reliant’ on income from Chinese studentsHalf of bosses at elite universities handed larger pay packetsThe OfS said access to university has been a “postcode lottery”, with young people from the northeast and southwest of England much less likely to go into higher education than those in London.Sir Michael Barber, chairman of OfS, said: “What is an assumed rite of passage for many young people across the country is often viewed very differently in rural and coastal communities, the industrial heartlands and military towns.“The north-south ide crops up in many debates around equal opportunities, and higher education is no exception.”Universities found to have failed to improve access can face sanctions by the watchdog including fines.\u0026nbspChris Skidmore, universities minister, said: “It is damning for the sector that large gaps still remain between disadvantaged students and their peers.”He added: “I am pleased to see universities being ambitious in their plans to reach out to those from disadvantaged backgrounds and to support them through their studies. But for universities which do not meet their registration conditions, I fully support the Office for Students to take appropriate action.”Office for Students\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspUniversity of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those first visitors were expected to arrive later this year.Adding new segments to the ISS could allow more people to travel to the station by increasing the volume, Axiom said, as well as leaving space for new kinds of research such as isolation studies and Earth observation.SpaceX to send Nasa astronauts to space soon, Elon Musk saysOver time, Axiom hopes that the work currently being done on the International Space Station is gradually transferred to its new private segment, allowing for it to continue without interruption when the ISS\u0026nbspis retired.At that point it will be able to detach and serve as a self-contained space station. At that point, Nasa will no longer have to pay for the cost of running the ISS or launching a replacement, Axiom suggested.In 2018, Axiom commissioned designer Philippe Starck to create interiors for the habitation module of a possible space station. He described the result as a comfortable and friendly egg.Starck’s vision was to create a nest, a comfortable and friendly egg, which would feature materials and colors stemmed from a fetal universe, a press release at the time said. The walls are sprinkled with hundreds of nano-Leds with changing colors as a continuation to the view on the universe through the large windows.Just as all the shades of lights and colors of day and night, the egg will also live to the mood and biorhythm of its osmotic inhabitant.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When they arrive at the Earth\u0027s ionosphere, they excite the oxygen and nitrogen atoms found in the upper atmosphere, and that energy is released as lights.Created with Sketch.Northern Lights across the UK - in pictures Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireThe beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireWhile the northern lights are often seen as one phenomenon, they are something like clouds: there are a whole host of different kinds, each of which are formed in their own particular ways.The new discovery began when the University of Helsinki\u0027s\u0026nbspMinna Palmroth looked to collect these different kinds of northern lights, in collaboration with enthusiasts. Those hobbyists took photographs of thousands of different examples of the northern lights, which she picked through and categorised for a book to guide those watching the\u0026nbspaurora borealis.A complete guide to the Northern LightsBut as the hobbyists collected those images through Facebook, they found that many of them included a kind of auroral form that was not part of the existing classification. Those were set aside to be examined later, and the book was published.Just days after it came out, enthusiasts spotted the mysterious form again: they saw a green-tinged, even set of waves that looked similar to dunes on a sandy beach. They told Professor Palmroth, who was able to get to work looking into it.One of the most memorable moments of our research collaboration was when the phenomenon appeared at that specific time and we were able to examine it in real time, says Northern Lights and astronomy hobbyist\u0026nbspMatti\u0026nbspHelin\u0026nbspin a statement.The hobbyists and space researchers worked together to collate photos from across Finland. Combining the images – and looking for clues such as stars in the background – allowed the scientists to discover where exactly the lights were coming from.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their waveform stretched 45 kilometres across.That height put them in a particularly neglected part of the sky: it is where the Earth\u0027s atmosphere collides with the edge of space, and is difficult for satellites to see.Due to the difficulties in measuring the atmospheric phenomena occurring between 80 and 120 kilometres in altitude, we sometimes call this area \u0027the\u0026nbspignorosphere\u0027, she said in a statement.The phenomenon appears to happen because of the bore phenomenon. Scientists say that gravity waves are born in the atmosphere and then rise up – but when they hit a particular layer, they can be bent and stretch out for long distances.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sadly, it seems the negative impact of the smacking ban will only be realised when it has come into force.”A letter from a group made sociologists, criminologists, child psychologists and parenting experts had earlier urged assembly members to oppose the law they called a “dangerous experiment”.​Welsh Conservative assembly member Janet Finch-Saunders claimed last year the ban could deter parents from England from holidaying in Wales.She said: “I don’t want people to be thinking, ‘I’m not going to Wales as I’m unclear about the law and I can’t reasonably parent my children’.“We don’t want reports of people coming on holiday to Llandudno and suddenly getting a knock on the door of their hotel, where somebody has accused them of smacking their child and they’re completely oblivious to this.”But the Association of Educational Psychologists has\u0026nbsppreviously called for\u0026nbspa ban on smacking, which it said “can have negative long-term effects on a child’s development”.Studies have linked corporal punishment of children to\u0026nbspincreased aggression\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspviolence among teenagers.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

German courts ruled egg producers could continue grinding male chicks to death until a scaleable means of determining the sex of an embryo in an egg was found.Shredding of chicks is permissible under EU law, so long as death is instantaneous and the bird is less than 72 hours old.\u0026nbspChick-fil-A to end donations to anti-LGBTQ organisationsHundreds of songbird chicks starve to death in European heatwaveSame-sex penguin couple have welcomed their first adopted chickParent bird spotted feeding cigarette butt to chickMr Guillaume said the same timescale would apply to banning the castration of piglets without anaesthesia, according to AFP.Boars are usually castrated to encourage animals reared for meat to put on weight, and because fat in the meat from uncastrated pigs can apparently gives off a more potent smell when cooked, and is known as “boar taint”. But boar taint only usually affects 20 per cent of uncastrated pigs.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would like to draw readers’ attention to the fact that sadly, the UK egg industry treats male chicks as though they are inanimate waste products, not living, breathing animals who are all iniduals and feel pain and suffering. They are routinely gassed at just a day old.“Laying hens, even in free range systems, can be crammed many thousands at a time into noisy, dusty, filthy sheds, some never able to access the outdoors. This is a far cry from the deceptive imagery on egg box packaging, with happy hens roaming freely in the sunshine, abundant grass underfoot. Once their laying declines and they are no longer deemed economically viable, they are typically crammed into crates and trucked off to the slaughterhouse at just a fraction of their natural life.\u0026nbsp“But really, we have no need to use and abuse animals in food production. The best thing we can do to help end this shocking cruelty is to give up eggs and other animal products and embrace a cruelty-free, vegan diet instead.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The UK will enter a transition period until  December .Before then, the UKs trading relationship with the EU will remain the same while the two sides negotiate a free trade deal.If a trade deal is ready in time, the UKs new relationship with the EU can begin immediately after the transition.Mr Johnson has ruled out any form of extension to the transition period.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable. But whatever the merits of his beliefs on climate change, the brutal fact is that establishment hypocrisy makes most people reach for the mute button.The nation’s honeymoon with Harry and Meghan did not end because we are racist bigots who could never accept a mixed-race woman in the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan were adored.They broke the spell when they wagged their virtuous fingers about climate change while hopping on and off private jets. It was their establishment hypocrisy that killed our love.One law for them and another for us. That makes people switch off.It isn’t complicated. You can fly by private jet OR you can lecture the world about saving the planet.But you can’t do both. Isn’t that screamingly obvious The Royal Family are not the only establishment hypocrites. Labour’s Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, a champion of the working man — thinks we should all send our children to the local comprehensive school.Even though, Lady Nugee confessed to Andrew Neil, that’s not what she chose for her own children.Establishment hypocrite.Harry and Meghan abandoned this country claiming they long for “financial independence”. Yet the millionaire couple always seem quite content to have some poor sucker sponsoring their lavish lestyle.There is no way Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan’s security.It is not politically possible for any Canadian PM to foist that expense on to their taxpayers.Ex-Mountie Larry Busch, who in the past has protected the royals in Canada, predicts the job will take  full-time officers and cost in excess of £.million a year.Who is going to pay for that  The “financially independent” Harry and Meghan  No chance.I can see it now. Mounties will do the heavy lting and British taxpayers will get the bill. THAT is why we went right off Harry and Meghan — their rank establishment hypocrisy.We have been endlessly told Harry and Meghan plan to refund us for the eye-watering £.million it cost to do up Frogmore Cottage, the beautul home in Windsor they no longer need or want.A refund I will believe it when I see it.Can we get a receipt THE Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Thursday. After all the years of pain and paralysis, it was finally official.The UK is leaving the European Union.Yet this historic moment did not even warrant a mention on the BBC’s Six O’Clock News.Incredible.And conclusive proof that the BBC no longer speaks for the nation.So the new Director-General of the Beeb has an existential problem.Because everyone at the corporation voted Remain, the largest vote for anything in our history – leaving the EU – has been treated as the ignorant spasm of .million uneducated, racist bigots.From crappy little comedy- shows to prestige news and current affairs, the BBC has been unapologetically biased against Brexit.The state broadcaster should be scrupulously neutral.In recent years, the BBC has been brazenly partisan.Look, we all have fond memories of growing up with the BBC. But this week I watched football on Sky and BT, drama on Amazon Prime and Netflix.None of the sport and drama I craved was on the BBC.Feeling nostalgic for Top Of The Pops and Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads  is not worth £. a year.The BBC is nakedly biased. And the BBC is increasingly irrelevant. So why does it still get £billion a year from the licence fee WITH Cats bombing at the box office, many of the cast are desperately distancing themselves from the furry turkey, including James Corden, who says he has not even seen the film.The exception is Taylor Swt, who says she has “no complaints”, adding: “I had a really great time working on that weird-ass movie.”But Taylor understands there are greater problems in le than having a flop at the box office.In an essay to mark her th birthday, she writes about her mother’s brain tumour.“Both my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again,” Taylor writes.“It’s taught me there are real problems and then there’s everything .”There is nothing like the loss of a loved one’s health to put le’s little knocks into perspective.THE president of the Durham Miners’ Gala sneers that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than allow newly elected Tory MPs to attend.Alan Mardghum says: “ did their best to destroy the Durham miners and the miners of Great Britain.”Does Mardghum honestly believe the mediocre Marxist muppets of today’s Labour Party have any interest in his community The Labour Party of today openly despises the British working class.That’s why so many ex-miners voted Tory.The proud, hardworking, patriotic communities of the North East have realised the Tories are now the party of the working class.If Alan Mardghum can’t see that, then he is dead in a ditch already. From the neck up.GEARING up for her turn as Catwoman in the next Batman movie, Zoe Kravitz reclines for the cover of the new issue of Elle magazine.You know you are getting old when you are shocked to learn the new Catwoman is the daughter of rocker Lenny Kravitz.A le peerage for a man who has done so much to make our lives a misery.Andthat doesn’t kill off the ermine-clad, silver spoon-sucking upper chamber for ever, nothing will.BORIS Johnson has asked Royal Mail chiefs to release a set of stamps commemorating Brexit to go on sale in January .It will be tough to improve upon the idea in Thursday’s Sun of a two-finger salute in front of the EU flag.The uniquely British gesture dates to the Battle of Agincourt in , when the French promised to cut off the index and middle fingers of English and Welsh archers.As French knights died in the Agincourt mud, our bowmen stuck up two fingers. More than an insult, it is a defiant message.We are still here. As a first-class stamp, it would take some licking.AFTER boasting about masturbating seven times a day preparing for his fight with Deontay Wilder, boxer Tyson Fury promises to bring out his own “w**k lotion” after the bout.“It’s called Tyson’s W**k Lotion,” reveals the Gypsy King.“It’s gonna be a bestseller because every-thing I put my name on goes to No, baby.”Meanwhile, Anthony Joshua is in talks for his own clash with hard-hitting Wilder this year.“A fight with me is what everyone wants to see,” says AJ.“Wilder has a great right hand.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King.

At times since the decisive referendum vote in , it looked asBrexit would remain a distant fantasy, thanks to the determination of much of the pro-EU establishment to overturn the result.But in the end, the will of the public has prevailed over federalist ideology. The dream of national freedom is about to become a reality.This change in status will represent a daunting challenge for Britain. No longer a regional province in the EU’s empire, we will take charge of our own destiny, with control over our economy, borders, laws, trade and justice system.With self-governance comes tremendous responsibility - and doubts and concerns about trade deals. But our nation can rise to the test.Indeed, Brexit could be the cue for the renewal of our institutions and the rebirth of our democracy.After all, we have achieved so much in the past as an independent nation, pioneering Parliamentary rule, leading the Industrial Revolution, and defeating tyranny in two World Wars.Given this heritage, there is no reason why Britain cannot embrace a new era of greatness.Yet that is not how the embittered Remainers see our future. Immersed in their worship of Brussels, obsessed with goal of European integration at the expense of nationhood, they continually preach the gospel of defeatism and despair.According to their gloomy propaganda, Brexit is a disastrous mistake, which will leave Britain hopelessly in decline.In their view, our country cannot survive on its own. The cold winds of isolation will be felt outside the warm embrace of the EU federation.This is the message that the pro-EU brigade has been peddling for years, ever since the referendum was first proposed.During the  campaign, the Government embarked on its notorious Project Fear, full of grim warnings about the dire consequences of abandoning our EU membership.One Treasury paper predicted that a vote for Leave would “represent an immediate and profound shock to the economy,” followed by a massive rise in unemployment and a meltdown in sterling.But these dire forecasts have not been realised. Instead, since , the British economy has proved to be remarkably robust.There has been no recession, no collapse in the property market, no explosion in the dole queues. On the contrary, the British jobs miracle has continued to accelerate.Only last week, official figures revealed that unemployment is down to its lowest level since , while the national workforce is at its largest in history.Particularly striking is the rise in self-employment to over five million, which indicates that the culture of enterprise is flourishing.Investors have not been deterred by Brexit.According to the Financial Times, “UK equities are positioned to outperform their peers in Europe and the USA.Manufacturing is also poised to prosper. Last week a survey by the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the biggest surge in confidence within this sector on record.Commenting on the “bullish” economic mood in Britain, the distinguished German journalist Alexander Von Schoenburg, editor-at-large of the bestselling BILD newspaper, wrote last weekend: “I see a nation with a strong sense of purpose, built on trust in its own capabilities and a powerful economy.I see a vibrant, open place that can attract huge amounts of foreign investment, has an unrivalled record in business start-ups and is a global pioneer in scientic and genetic research.”Von Schoenburg is right. Our independent future can be a golden one. Already the International Monetary Fund, which in  warned of recession, now predicts that over the next two years, economic growth will be twice as fast in the UK as in any other G state in Europe.What the pessimists ignore are the huge advantages held by Britain, like the global dominance of the English language, the cultural reach of our arts, music and entertainment industries, the strength of our financial services and the solidity of our political system - which was recently demonstrated again in the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s quasi-revolutionary Labour party.A recent poll of , chief executives, carried out by the consultancy firm PwC, found that the UK is increasingly attractive to global businesses looking for growth and investment opportunities.Commenting on the survey, PwC’s chairman Kevin Ellis said that “viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability.”Indeed, on the eve of Brexit, the real crisis is faced, not by Britain, but by the EU and its member states.Whereas Britain can show its dynamism by the embrace of global competition and commerce, Europe is still trapped in outdated economic structures, characterised by heavy regulation, state intervention and unaffordable welfare.Almost every European nation is now in trouble, dragged down by sluggish growth and political dislocation.While Germany hovers on the brink of recession, France is in turmoil because of ferocious opposition to attempts by President Macron’s Government to reform its vast public sector and expensive pension schemes.Spain is now in the grip of socialism, Italy in economic sclerosis. Ireland’s current General Election is unlikely to give any one party more than  per cent of the vote, a recipe for more fragility.For the EU itself, Brexit represents a threat to its very existence.That is not just because of the loss of Britain’s budget contributions, signicant though they are.It is more becauseBritain prospers outside the EU, then the justication for Brussels rule would be permanently demolished.All the claims about the necessity of political integration would be exposed as delusions. That is why pro-EU campaigners so dread the possibility of a booming Britain on the continent’s doorstep.Our success would be the EU’s nightmare.There is, of course, no guarantee that Britain will flourish.There could be dficult times ahead, prompted by a global recession or the refusal of the USA to reach a trade deal because of security objections to the involvement of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in our broadband network.Equally, the EU might prove tough in its own negotiations with us about a trade agreement. Already this week the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has “the upper hand” and the “stronger team”.But the cause of British independence has triumphed over serious obstacles in the recent past.With determination and vision, our country can do so again, emboldened by the taste of freedom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems certain people are jumping the gun.Andrews fightback comes as Jeffrey Epsteins victims lawyers have said the royals lack of cooperation with the FBI is a slap in the face and raises more questions.In a dramatic press conference on Monday, the FBI said they had contacted the royals attorneys, requesting an interview, but had been provided zero cooperation.US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who is representing five of Epsteins alleged victims, yesterday blasted the princes lack of assistance, while another lawyer representing Andrews accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre said his failure to cooperate raises even more questions.Speaking to Sky News, Ms Bloom said: He did an interview where he showed zero compassion for the victims and after the backlash he said no, I have compassion for the victims and to prove it Im going to cooperate with law enforcement.And now we find out hes shown zero cooperation.This is really a slap in the face to the victims, to the five who I represent, to the probably hundreds more who allege Jeffrey Epstein assaulted them.Why doesnt he want to cooperate I think thats the question. What is he trying to hide, what is he afraid of.It has since been reported the FBI had been trying to interview the under-fire royal since November.Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, revealed the prince’s lack of cooperation on Monday during a dramatic press conference outside Epstein’s mansion.He said: “The Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew’s attorneys and requested to interview Prince Andrew, and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation.”The top prosecutor said he was revealing the information because the prince “publicly offered, indeed in a press release, to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators”.Speaking at the press conference – held to promote a new law to make it easier for child sex abuse victims to sue – Mr Berman said the probe into Epstein’s network was continuing.Mr Bermans explosive revelation sparked fury from those representing victims of sex beast Epstein – including Ms Roberts Giuffre.The American mum-of-three, now , claims she was forced to have sex with the prince three times when she was a teenager, after being trafficked to him by Epstein.ITS been two months since Prince Andrew vowed he would help in the investigation against his paedo pal Jeffrey Epstein.But the Duke of York was thrown into the spotlight as the FBI revealed they had received zero cooperation from the Queens second son.So what has the -year-old royal been doing while US authorities say they were desperately trying to contact him Instead of helping the FBI, he seems to have found the time to jet off to Spain for luxury golfing breaks, go horse riding with the Queen, help Princess Beatrice plan her forthcoming wedding, attend royal dinners and enjoy Kate Middletons birthday bash.While Epstein victim Virginia Roberts begged him to come clean in August last year, the royal was pictured enjoying a round of golf at the exclusive Real Club Valderrama in Sotogrande, southern Spain.Prince Andrew finally sat down to answer the mounting criticisms three months later in November - vowing in the Panorama interview that he was willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency in their investigations.Yet he seems to have done everything but cooperate with the authorities.In fact just two days later, stripped of his royal duties, he was seen riding with his mother, the Queen at Windsor.The royal then kept a low profile - not conducting any official engagements since then.Instead, the keen golfer has been apparently kept busy with family le with his daughter Princess Beatrices engagement to Mapelli Mozzi.However, the dad was not seen at the couples engagement party in December.Instead, he was only seen heading to Christmas lunch with the rest of the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace.His schedule then saw him a week later attend the Sandringham church service with the Queen before joining the Royal Family celebrating Kate Middletons th birthday.The weekend just gone saw him busy with engagements - again spotted riding horses with friends on the grounds of Windsor Castle.The royal has vehemently denied her claims.Sigrid McCawley, who represents Ms Roberts Giuffre, said: Prince Andrew should take most seriously the deeply held belief in this country that no one is above the law.She added: Prince Andrews continued refusal to cooperate with the authorities after freely acknowledging that he would be prepared to answer enquiries raises even more questions about the role he played in the international sex trafficking ring Jeffrey Epstein and others operated.Jack Scarola, another lawyer representing Ms Roberts Giuffre, told The Sun: “It is obvious that Prince Andrew is persisting in a pattern of non-cooperation which is now been going on for years.“I would certainly believe that he should recognise his moral obligation to participate in the search for the truth.“With all that the victims of Jeffrey Epstein have been through – over so many years – I would say that they expected nothing dferent.”Speaking directly of Andrew’s accuser, he added: “I am sure that Virginia had no other expectations than Prince Andrew would refuse to voluntarily cooperate.”Andrew claried his intention to co-operate with the FBI following his disastrous interview with BBC’s Newsnight in November.During the BBC interview, Andrew said he would have to consult with his lawyers before testying under oath about his ties to Epstein.But in a statement after the broadcast, he said: “Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.”FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are trying to bring justice for dozens of Epstein’s victims – by going after his alleged accomplices.Epstein, , killed himself in jail last year while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking allegations – following numerous bungled probes into his conduct.Prosecutors had accused him of sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida before he hanged himself.Shortly after Epstein’s death, Mr Berman issued a statement vowing to continue the investigation into his co-conspirators.They are now said to be zeroing in on Ghislaine Maxwell – a close friend of Andrew – who is alleged to have acted at Epstein’s ‘pimp’.Maxwell – who is currently in hiding – has denied any wrongdoing.He said he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms Roberts Giuffre and claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on one of the days they were meant to have had sex.When asked whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, the prince said: “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming  Yes.”“Unbecoming ” Miss Maitlis replied. “He was a sex offender.”A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on the FBI claims last night, but a source close to the prince said: “This issue is being dealt with by The Duke of York’s legal team”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

despite the soar in case numbers.During the SARS pandemic, between  and , the number of infections reached , in mainland China, where  people were also killed.While some experts believe coronavirus is not as deadly as SARS, there are fears over it spreading quickly and key features are still unknown, including how lethal it really is.Like other respiratory infections, it is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes, with an incubation time from one to  days.There are limited signs it may also be able to spread before symptoms show.The World Health Organisationhas said it is confident in Chinas ability to contain the coronavirus, but concern is mounting as cases continue to rise.Last night, the death toll rose by  to  - almost all in the province of Hubei - where the virus emerged last month at an animal market in the capital, Wuhan.The central province of about  million people is under virtual lockdown.Concern is also growing over the impact of the virus on the worlds second-biggest economy, with airlines cutting flights to China and global companies restricting employee travel there.In what could be a major step towards reining in the disease, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside China.Efforts are underway to find a vaccine, but even the most optimistic timelines suggest eight weeks to several months of scientic development before human clinical trials can begin.By that time, hundreds more could have died and numerous other countries infected.As infections spread and the number of cases rises, numerous countries are scrambling to get citizens out of Wuhan, while also hoping to keep the virus at bay.The city, with a population of  million, is racing to build two dedicated hospitals for coronavirus victims, with the first ,-bed facility to be completed next week.The capacity of the second will be expanded from , to , beds, the official Peoples Daily said.It comes amid fears over a rise in coronavirus cases in patients whove never been to China.Vietnam was the first country to report a positive coronavirus case spread to a person who hasnt been to China, the World Health Organisation confirmed at the weekend.Since then there have been further cases of domestic human-to-human transmission in patients in Germany, Taiwan and Japan.A taxi driver from Japan, who was driving tour groups of people visiting from Wuhan, where the virus originated, was among those to test positive for the bug.Another included a man in Germany who had come into contact with a colleague who had travelled from China for a training course.The virus has spread across China and to at least  countries globally after the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan.Its terrying spread is being tracked across the globe on a live heat map charting where and when it has struck.The first death, that of a -year-old man, has now been recorded in Beijing, where the youngest case was also reported - a nine-year-old girl.So far there have been no reported deaths from coronavirus outside of China.An outbreak of the virus is understood to have started at an open air fish market in the Chinese city of Wuhan - which has since been put in lockdown after  people died and more than  people were infected globally.A new study published in the China Science Bulletin this week claimed that the new coronavirus shared a strain of virus found in bats.Previous deadly outbreaks of SARS and Ebola were also believed to have originated in the flying mammal.Experts had thought the new virus wasnt capable of causing an epidemic as serious as those outbreaks because its genes were dferent.But this latest research appeared to prove otherwise - as scientists scrabble to produce a vaccine.In a statement, the researchers said: “The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate.Meanwhile, scientists at Peking University also claim that the deadly virus was passed to humans from bats - but say it was through a mutation in snakes.The researchers said that the new strain is made up of a combination of one that affects bats and another unknown coronavirus.They believe that combined genetic material from both bats and this unknown strain picked up a protein that allows viruses bind to certain host cells -

There may be other proteins involved.”The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was  times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox.British Airways announced it has halted all its flights to and from China - as the Governments urgent plans to evacuate Brits from the outbreak epicentre of Wuhan are being finalised.The Government has advised against all but essential travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak.Experts have warned the deadly bug will become a worldwide pandemic  governments do not impose heavy global travel bans.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I trust you’.”The chopper had been climbing out of the clouds when the aircraft banked left and began a sudden and terrying ,-foot drop before its crash.Determining what caused the crash will take months, with investigators scouring the crash site for clues and collecting debris.But the Sikorsky S-B helicopter was missing the terrain awareness warning systemthat warns pilotsthey are flying too close to obstacles, the National Transportation Safety Board revealed yesterday.The transit agency previously made two recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration that the government agency require helicopters carrying six or more passengers to have the technology installed, but the FAA refused.The recommendations were made in March , two years after a similar helicopter – a Sikorsky S-A++ – fatally crashed in the Gulf of Mexico and killed all  passengers aboard, NBC News reported.Though TAWS would have been helpful for the chopper to have, officials said theres no guarantee it would have prevented the fatal crash.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will hold a Cabinet meeting in the north before a night-time TV address from Downing Street, festooned with a projected countdown clock and a light show. million special p coins will enter circulation, Union flags will hang in Parliament Square and outside Buckingham Palace - and despite efforts to, Big Ben wonapost bong. No one can deny itaposs a historic moment. Britain is the first nation ever to leave. But what about beyond the pomp and ceremony  What will actually change for you, your loved ones and the country  Hereaposs a guide to what our leaving the EU on Friday means. This is the legal moment that the UK becomes the first nation ever to leave the European Union - after three failed exit dates of March , April  and October  last year. Itaposs at pm because thataposs midnight Brussels time. At this instant, the EU Withdrawal Agreement Act, passed by Parliament last week, will take effect. It will make legal the apostransition periodapos, continuing EU rules until December , and begin £bn in aposorce billapos payments to the EU which stretch for several years. Meanwhile, No will mark the moment with a speech by Boris Johnson, a light show and a countdown clock projected onto the black bricks of  Downing Street. Just down the road in Parliament Square, Nigel Farage and Tory Brexiteers will hold a rally.  From pm the UK is legally out of the EU and can no longer cancel Brexit by revoking Article . UK citizens will cease to be citizens of the EU. If the UK wants to rejoin the EU, it has to do so under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty, a y process that needs the approval of all  states. Yet nothing much will change in your day-to-day le for  months, until  December . Thataposs because we are in a apostransition periodapos and continue to follow EU rules until then. The Brexit deal says the transition period can be extended by two years. But the government passed a law banning any extension. How much things change after  December depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU. If we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January . If not, we could crash out on aposWTO termsapos - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade. Thereaposs more detail below on the things that might change in January .  But there are still some things that will definitely change from Friday. The Brexit Department will be abolished and a new Taskforce Europe Team within No will lead the UKaposs trade talks - headed by the PMaposs chief Europe adviser David Frost. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will lose his Cabinet job, though he could be given another one where. Blue passports will start being issued to all new applications, instead of the burgundy ones, from mid  and have already lost their European Union branding. Your old passport remains valid though, as long as itaposs in date. The economy will have some security thanks to the deal, but isnapost expected to rocket while speculation continues in the transition period. Some analysis has claimed house prices will rise as buyers move after years of uncertainty, but sellers are also coming on to the market too so the verdict is far from certain. These things wonapost change yet - but you should watch out Travelling abroad  Travel firms are insisting everything will remain the same for UK holidaymakers in the EU after January . That is because there will be no restrictions on travel to the EU until at least January . Queues of lorries at ports arenapost expected either because there will be no extra checks. But again, these could spring up in January  - especiallythere is no trade deal. The shape of the future relationship, trading checks or any travel restrictions is not yet established, and will be part of trade talks over the next  months. Passports and visas  Brits will not need a visa to travel to the EU after January . You can keep using EU passport gates at airports. UK government guidance says you wonapost need a visa from  January  either -youaposre a tourist. But you will have a limited stay of up to  days in any -day period, and you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer. You may also need to show aticket, show you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders. From , Brits must also have at least six months left on their passportsgoing to the EU.  Your passport must also be no more than  years old, evenit has time left, from  January . Driving abroad  After January , a UK driving licence is still the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel in the EU. But after  January  you may need to get an International Driving Permit. There are three types - make sure you get the right one for the right country. A full list is here. The £. documents were once a niche bit of paperwork but million a year are expected to be handed out. After  January  you also need to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance . Allow a month to get this from your insurance firm. You also need a GB bumper sticker. Bringing pets abroad  Pet owners can carry own bringing their beloved animals to the EU on apospet passportsapos until December. But they must prepare four months in advancethey are planning a holiday on or after  January . Current advice for after January  is the animal must have a rabies vaccination, followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But to add an extra layer of red tape, this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. So you need to get your timing right. Healthcare in the EU  Nothing changes from pm on Friday - but you should start preparing for . From the end of , the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work. After that there will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare. Instead it is up to the UK to strike reciprocal health cover with inidual states - a sort of aposweaposll fund your peopleyou fund oursapos system. Back last year the UK and Spain struck an agreement to continue health cover until the end of there was no deal. One might expect a pact after that too, but for other countries itaposs less certain. Because of this, travellers from the UK to EU are being told to ensure they have adequate insurance for the full duration of their trip in  and beyond. For EU migrants to the UK,there is no reciprocal agreement, there is a £-a-year charge to use the health service. EU citizens  EU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for settled status, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Those who havenapost lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for pre-settled status, then again for settled status when they hit the five-year mark. After  January , new EU citizens who want to come to the UK will be subject to a points-based immigration system. They will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary. Mobile roaming  Again, there will be no change from January  - but things could change from  January . Upon leaving the EU, there will no longer be guaranteed free mobile phone roaming for UK customers on the Continent as the issue will be left to the market. Youaposre advised to check with your phone operatortravelling after  January . Moving abroad  UK citizens can continue arriving freely in EU countries to live and work until  December . But to stay after that date ex-pats will need to apply for a residency status. The exact system ies by country but the UK government claims it will be short, simple and either free of charge, or cost no more than applying for a similar document, for example a national identity card or passport. Guides for expats in each country will appear here as they are thrashed out.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA woman who turned to food to smother the grief of having eight miscarriage has lost three-and-a-half stone. In her worst moment, while drunk at a party, Helen Harrington told friends she killed babies, as she battled with her self-esteem and body issues. She gave up any hope of being a mum and even told her husband he had her permission to leave her. Helen says she then turned to food to smother her growing grief. She said: “I was absolutely devastated. I was angry with my body because I felt it had let me down, and I was angry with myself because I felt I had failed as a woman. “I remember being very drunk at a New Year party and telling everyone ‘I kill babies’.” Helen even told her husband, Dean, thathe wanted children he could leave – and she wouldn’t blame him. Now, the -year-old former nurse, from Halewood, Merseyside, has lost ½ stones and is happier than ever before. She said: “I’m the ‘best Helen’ I have ever been. “I’ve lost weight, I have finally got the family I have always wanted and le is amazing. At last, I don’t feel like I’m a failure.” Helen had never had a problem with her weight.  If anything, as a child, she was skinny and underweight – “my mum would try and feed me up with milk and eggs” – but marriage, her traumatic attempts to become a mum and orce from her first husband would see her piling on the pounds. She said: “Up until I was , I was tiny. “I got married for the first time at , and that was when I started putting on weight. At first, it was because I was happy and content. It was , the era of the dinner party, and we were very much into it. It was our way of socialising. “But I was also a crisp demon. I’d think nothing of having five packets of crisps for my lunch. Yet that was nothing, until after she suffered four miscarriages in  months and saw her nine-year marriage collapse and end in orce. Helen said: “It was really hard, I held on to each pregnancy until four to five weeks and then start to bleed and lose it. People would say ‘well, at least it happened early on’, but to me that didn’t make any dference.  “As far as I was concerned, every single time that pregnancy test had a stripe across it, to me that was a bouncing blue-eyed baby on my knee. And, every time I lost one, my hope would dip a little bit more.” After three miscarriages, Helen was referred for tests and diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndromein which the immune system produces abnormal antibodies that make the blood “stickier” than normal. She met Dean, who she describes as “the man of my dreams”. “I was happy. Dean was – is – my soulmate and I thought I was finally going to have this family I’d longed for. I’d get pregnant, have treatment and we’d be up and running,” she smiles. “I had told Dean about my issues but neither of us had had any worries at all about it not being okay.” The couple tied the knot when Helen was  and tried for a family almost straight away. But within a year, in spite of treatment, she had suffered four miscarriages in  months. Helen said: “I was devastated all over again. I managed to keep one pregnancy until  weeks and, for once, I thought that was it. “My mental health started to deteriorate badly. I went down and down.  “I’d discovered, too, that I had what are known as ‘killer cells’. NK cells populate the inner wall of the uterus during formation of the placenta and are known to be a major cause of miscarriage. We added treatment for that which included steroids which made me balloon, to the treatment for sticky blood. But nothing worked. “After the last miscarriage, I sat down and said ‘I’m never going to have a child of my own’. It’s hard to say how it makes you feel but, amid the anger, I was sorry for Dean, because I felt I had let him down, too. Me and my body that didn’t work. “I told him that it was me, not him, and that,he couldn’t cope with not having children,he wanted them, he could leave me and I’d understand. But he told me he loved me and that it didn’t matter. He was going nowhere.” Eventually, they did have a family, a boy and a girl, after they decided to adopt. “That all happened really quickly and we got a little boy and a little girl, brother and sister, aged four and three. We were thrilled.” But Helen’s weight continued to soar as her mental health plummeted. “We were really happy, our family was perfect and we had great days out and enjoyed our lives together,” admits Helen. “But I think the stress of what I’d been through just came crashing down and I suffered from anxiety and depression and, having put on and lost weight previously, all my bad habits ed.”“It was my GP who referred me for weight management and gave me a Slimming World voucher who helped me to turn it around. I was  and I lost  pounds in a year."},{"url":null,"title":"doting kate middleton high fives","story":"NewsKate Middleton names surprise food George and Charlotte love on nursery visitThe Duchess of Cambridge will discuss the survey ‘ Big Questions on the Under Fives’ with staff as she visits Stockwell Gardens Nursery  Pre-school in LondonShareCommentsByRussell MyersDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video duchess-cambridge-arrives-south-london-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news doting-kate-middleton-high-fives-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Duchess of Cambridge, dressed in a bright turquoise coat, black jeans and boots, has taken her landmark survey about childrenaposs development to LEYFStockwell Gardens Nursery  Pre-school. When she arrived, she beamed with smiles as she was greeted by delighted staff and parents. Kate chatted to a dad about how men are more engaged with the early stages of kidsapos lives. Inside the nursery, she laughed as she interacted with the children, high-fiving them, pouring their breakfast cereal and asking them what their favourite fruit was. Kate had added bowls of fruit to a trolley laden with cereals and milk before wheeling it into a classroom. Speaking about healthy foods, she revealed her own young kids love beetroot. When Kate first arrived she met a group of parents who had just dropped off their children, and chatting to one father she highlighted how more men are now engaged with the crucial initial stages of their childaposs le. She said: I think thataposs changed, thereaposs a lot more engagement from parents in general and particularly fathers who want to be involved in this early stage of development. In the kitchen Kate chatted to pre-school trainee chefs Luke Nelson-Neil and Rouchelle Scott-Ashby, who are taking part in a  month apprenticeship run by the LEYF Early Years Chef Academy.  The trio chatted about food nutrition for children and when they started discussing particular foods Mr Nelson-Neil joked about beetroots saying I still canapost get them to eat it. The duchess, who is the mother of three young children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, said: Mine absolutely love it - itaposs one of those things until you try it you donapost know. After bringing in breakfast for the children she joined three little girls who sat down at tiny tables to eat, and the Kate took a shine to three-year-old Lucy, stroking her arm and leaning forward as she asked her what she wanted.  Kate poured out cereal for Lucy and her classmates asking them to say stop when there was enough in their bowls and later she turned to a plate of orange, banana, grape and papaya segments asking what do you think of the fruit, whataposs your favourite  Before leaving she high-fived the trio and joined a group of three and four-your-year-olds playing with shells in a water play pit, and she also joined a another breakfast table of youngsters. Kate will discuss the survey ‘ Big Questions on the Under Fives’ with staff during her trip today. It was launched last week and she has revealed , people had already signed up.  Conducted by Ipsos MORI on behalf of The Royal Foundation, it aims to encourage conversation on early influencing children’s healthy food choices. The Duchess will hear about the importance of nutritious food for a child’s development from apprentices at the LEYF Early Years Chef Academy, before helping nursery teachers to serve breakfast to the children. LEYF Early Years Chef Academy offers a specialist qualication for chefs either working or keen to work with children up to the age of eight and in ensuring strong, healthy foundations for the youngest in our society that will positively affect their lelong outcomes.  Kate, who has devoted eight years to her project, said: It’s great to visit places like this where communities come together to support one another. Last week I launched a UK-wide survey on early childhood because I want to hear society’s views about raising the next generation.  I’m so happy that over , people from all across the UK have already completed it, and I can’t wait to see the results.  Last week, The Duchess launched the Survey during visits to MiniBrum at ThinkTank, Birmingham Science Museum, Ely and Careau Children’s Centre in Cardf and HMP Send near Woking. LEYF is a social enterprise that was designed to strengthen the important roles chefs play in educating staff and parents, and add value to the le of the community and future generations by strengthening local networks. The survey contains five short questions and aims to spark a national conversation on the early years that will ultimately help bring about positive, lasting change for generations to come.  It is designed to bring together the thoughts of as many people as possible – recognising that everyone has a role in ensuring strong, healthy foundations for the youngest in our society that will positively affect their lelong outcomes. The findings should provide a vital source of information for the early years sector, helping it to better understand public perceptions of the importance of the early years, and the first-hand experiences of parents, families and carers. This public feedback will also help to focus Kateaposs work through The Royal Foundation as she endeavours to provide children across the UK with the best foundations to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.  The launch of the survey follows eight years of work by The Duchess of Cambridge in which she has explored how experiences in early childhood often lie at the root of the hardest social challenges the country faces today. What we experience in the earliest years – from in the womb to the age of five – is instrumental in shaping our future lives. Kate has spent time meeting with families across the country and hearing about the issues they deal with day-to-day, in addition to speaking with academics, experts, organisations and practitioners.

He had been accused of murdering his childrenaposs nanny, Sandra Rivett, and had gone on the run following her death. There have been no confirmed sightings of the peer in more than  years and in  he was legally declared dead. But now, Sandraaposs son, Neil Berrimen, claims to have uncovered bombshell evidence that proves Lucan is alive and has carved out a new le in Australia. Neil says Lucan, who is now in his s, shares a home and lives as a Buddhist - and has handed police his dossier of evidence. The -year-old said: He has been alive all this time. Lying about who he is. Lying about it to his new friends. “They are fully aware he is a mystery elderly Englishman and not who he is claiming to be. “The people he lives with know he has a mystery past and what he tells them does not add up. They have had their suspicions for many years. “Lucan is a deceitful conman and he is the man who murdered my mother. “There is absolutely no doubt in my mind he escaped that night, with the help of friends who helped him get across the Channel and get a new passport, and incredibly he is still alive. “From my own inquiries he’s had at least six dferent identities. Neil has spent more than £, of his own money in his quest to find out what really happened to the man who killed his mother. Lucan disappeared after the murder of Miss Rivett at the family’s exclusive mews home in Belgravia, Central London, on November , . Born into a wealthy family, Lucan had plenty of connections and on the night of the murder fled to a friendaposs house. He wrote two letters to his close friend, Bill Shanyd Kidd. In one of them he said: I am only concerned about the children. If you can manage it I would like them to live with you.” Eton-educated, Lucan was one of the early members of the exclusive Clermont Club in London, which prided itself on its A-list membership. Founded in  by John Aspinall, its original crowd included five dukes, five marquesses,  earls and two cabinet ministers. The rich and famous were desperate for a seat at the influential and the club soon boasted A-list members like Hollywood star Peter Sellers, James Bond author Ian Fleming, artist Lucien Freud, and businessman James Goldsmith, father of Jemima and Zac. Despite working as a merchant banker, Lucan quit his lucrative role to become a professional gambler, something he developed a taste for while he was serving in the Coldstream Guards. He earned himself the nickname aposLuckyapos after winning £,, which would be worth about £, today, in just  hours in . But Lucan also had huge losses, which he would brush off in front of his friends, who were among the wealthiest men in the world. He met and married Veronica Duncan in  and the couple welcomed their child, Frances, the following year. In , and by now a full-time gambler, Lucan was even in the running to become the next James Bond but declined an invite to screen test for the role. After breakfasting at am and walking his dog, Lucan would spend most of his days at the exclusive club in Mayfair. The members would while away hours playing poker, blackjack and roulette, along with Lucanaposs favourite fame of backgammon. In his book The Gamblers, author John Pearson said: “At the heart of the Set lay a belief that risk-takers are the people who make civilisation tick. “Cruel, heartless and snobbish, they gambled with their fortunes and kept a stf upper lip when they lost. “This and a loyalty to each other that transcended everything .” Rich and entitled, the members hated Harold Wilson and would gossip for hours about the royal family, many of whom they were familiar with. Bill Shand Kydd was a former jockey whose older brother was married to Princess Dianaaposs mother for almost two decades. His we was Lucanaposs weaposs sister and had introduced the couple. Every member of the club was rich and extremely well connected - which founder Aspinall had planned from the start. However, Lucanaposs betting losses were by now far exceeding his winnings, something he largely kept secret from his we. Two more children followed, George and Camilla, and Veronica suffered from post-mtatal depression. This, coupled with Lucanaposs increasing gambling debts, was taking a severe toll on their marriage and at Christmas in  he moved into a small house close by. Veronica tried to reconcile but Lucan was adamant the relationship was over and all he wanted was custody of their three children. In , Lucan had lost a bitter court case with his we over who would care for their children and the cost of fighting it had left him in serious financial trouble. He was by now drinking heavily and his friends in the Clermont Club were starting to worry, especially when he started ranting about wanting to murder his we. James Goldsmith, a key member of the Clermont Club, acted as a guarantor on a £, overdraft for Lucan, which remained unpaid for years. For decades rumours have swirled that Lucanaposs friends at the club, who had access to private jets and bolt holes around the world, whisked him out of the country following Sandraaposs murder. Then, in an interview eight years ago, the Clermont Clubaposs former secretary, Shirley Robey, said she believed Lucan had fled and had been living abroad for the last  years. Shirley claimed to have overheard a chat between club owner Aspinall and James Goldsmith about Lucan.

Brendan Rowan-Davies is accused of the murder of Kelly-Anne Case, whose naked body was found by firefighters lying on her bed at her home in Gosport, Hampshire, which had been set alight after she had been killed on the morning of July  last year. The -year-old had her throat cut and her hands bound with cable ties, the trial at Winchester Crown Court has heard. William Mousley QC, prosecuting, has told the court that a post-mortem examination showed that Ms Caseaposs throat had been cut several times and she had suffered several other wounds.  When asked by his counsel Kate Lumsdon QChe had killed Ms Case and set fire to her house, Rowan-Davies, who the jury was told has a low IQ and dyslexia, said: No. He went on to describe how he was threatened by someone with a kne in her home and saw Ms Case lying dead on her bed. The defendant said that on the evening of July  he met up with friend Will Vallender and they took a taxi together to Ms Caseaposs home. He said that Ms Case was a bit upset and she pulled out a kne and said she was going to kill herself.The defendant said he took the kne from her, hugged her and told her: Donapost think like that. He said they spent the night talking, drinking vodka and energy drinks and they all took cocaine. Rowan-Davies said that he told Ms Case that he fancied her as a joke which he told her every time I have seen her and he said that she just laughed and he was not upset at her response. He said that during the night, the three of them went upstairs and he filmed Ms Case and Mr Vallender having sex in her bedroom using his mobile phone by popping his hand round the edge of the door and filming them in a mirror.  The defendant said he left Ms Caseaposs home with Mr Vallender but later ed alone because he had left his tobacco at her home. He said that when he went inside and upstairs at the house, a person put a kne to his throat from behind and he saw Kelly dead on her bed with an injury to her throat. He said the person said to him: If you say anything, I will kill you, your family and anyone you tell. He said he felt scared and left the house and did not tell anyone because he was scared for his le.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailColin and Sharon Jamison had two beautul little girls, but they always knew they wanted to have more children. We thought over time that there are a lot of children out there who donapost have homes, Colin told . Rather than bringing more in to the world, letaposs look after the ones already here. That was  years ago, and since then the couple, who live in Belfast, have dedicated their time to helping to raise children as foster parents. Theyaposve had more than  children through their door with placements lasting anywhere between a few days and  years. Colin, , said: We’ve had children who have had multiple carers before us and have lost their identity along the way. It’s important for us to give these young people the security they need. When you see a children develop and you start to see them progress at school, you really feel the benefits of what youaposre doing. A child who has been withdrawn starts to come out of themselves, itaposs really good to see. Sharon, , added: Even seeing them have the confidence to be cheeky back to you, because thataposs natural. Throughout their many years of fostering, the couple have cared for children with a wide range of needs and behaviours, including young people with challenging behaviours, teenagers and those with le-limiting disabilities. Speaking as part of Barnardoaposs Fostering Week, Colin says that as a foster carer “you have to look past what you’re seeing on the exterior and find the young child.” The coupleaposs daughters Nicola and Samantha were six and three when their first placement arrived, and Colin and Sharon admit they were worried about how it might affect them. Sharon said: That was a concern for us. They had to be our priotity. Luckily the girls loved having a new friend to play with and have always been very supportive of having other children in their home. They were really happy about it. They understood that some children need a bit of support. Theyaposre very caring girls. As theyaposve grown up theyaposve got more and more involved. Our eldest did get a bit jealous with our first placement, but she was able to come and talk to us. We understood that and made sure everybody felt included.  Their longest placement was a little girl who had motor neurone disease, who stayed with them from the age of nine until she passed away aged . Sharon said: We were told she couldnapost talk or communicate, she couldnapost even smile. She was just the most amazing wee girl. It was just like a flower opened up when she could give expressions, her eyes just sparkled. She passed away while living with the Jamison family. She had a really lovely le. She had fun and she never complained even though she was in a lot of pain. She inspired up and kept us going. Everybody around her, social workers, family, came together to make sure her le could be good. We look have very positively, everybody made her happy. The couple attended a Barnardoaposs information event after a friend saw newspaper advert at the same time they were discussing the idea of fostering behind closed doors and gave to them by complete chance.  Colin already knew about the incredible work Barnardoaposs does as some of his school friends lived in one of their childrenaposs homes. The couple now focus on giving the children who stay with them happy memories from their childhoods in a bid to ensure they have nice things to look back on when theyaposre older. He said: When children come in to a strange environment they seem a bit confused and scared. Itaposs great having chuldren who are close in age to them. As adults we stand back and let the children do a lot of the engaging. They soon settle in to the routine. Sharon adds: You can have a child that settles within a few weeks and feels like theyaposve been here forever. But some donapost settle for years. The couple once looked after one boy who packed his bags every time they had an argument as he was convinced they would say they had had enough of him and kick him out, even though he had lived with them for four years.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA hero who swooped in to rescue a baby during one of Americaaposs most deadly mass shootings has finally been identied as a homeless man. Authorities confirmed they had managed to confirm the identity of the mystery figure seen in security footage carrying the infant to safety amid the shooting at a Walmart in Texas. Police had issued an appeal to identy the person who saved the baby while the shooter was still on the loose in the horror that killed  last August. The baby was left orphaned following the El Paso massacre, allegedly carried out by -year-old gunman Patrick Crusius. This week, El Paso authorities finally were able to confirm the identity of the figure hailed for his le-saving heroics during the drama after he came forward and gave a detailed account to a local newspaper. Authorities said Lazaro Ponce is credited with saving the le of baby Paul Anchondo, who was just two months old when his family was caught up in the shooting. Mr Ponce, who was reportedly homeless at the time of the attack, potentially saved many lives when he repeatedly ed to the horrors in the store to aid the wounded.  The confirmation of his identity came after Mr Ponce gave a detailed account of the horrors of the day to the El Paso Times. He described how he had gone back into the shop and begun treating injured people when he found the tiny baby. Mr Ponce told the newspaper he had applied pressure to wounds, rushed to the aid of a man in a wheelchair and an elderly woman shot in the arm. He added that he was no longer homeless and had been living in Memphis working as a labourer, and living on a workmateaposs property.  The parents of the baby died in the mass violence, in what became the seventh deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Five months on from the attack, Mr Ponce is being interviewed by FBI agents as a potential witness in the shooting, as the case looks set to go to trial. Both baby Paulaposs mother, Jordan Anchondo, and his father, Andrew Anchondo, died in the shooting, in an account that broke hearts around the world. Reports at the time said Paulaposs mother had been holding the baby when she was fatally shot, but managed to fall in such a way that she shielded him from the gunfire. He survived with only broken bones but was trapped in the store with the shooter still on the loose when Mr Ponce spotted him still clinging to his dying mother.  The -year-old transient labourer said he and his we, Crystal Ann Roberts, , were at the McDonaldaposs inside the Walmart when they heard the shooting begin. This guy started to kill people outside, Ponce said in a Spanish-language interview with the newspaper.I heard the gunshots, understand  At first, I thought someone was playing drums or someone had a festival going on outside. He at first hid from the gunfire but worriedhe stayed put, the shooter would get to him - so he made a run for it. He turned back for his we but couldnapost see her, later finding out she had managed to flee with others to safety outdoors.  Most of the victims were inside a bank in the Walmart, and Mr Ponce said he instinctively began trying to help the wounded. He described how he found the babyaposs motheraposs still alive with Paul on her body, where he had been carried like a aposbackpack.apos He said the mother was perilously wounded and unable to move, so he told her: ‘Let me get this kid in case thiscomes backapos. He claims he ran out of the story carrying the baby and raced him to waiting police and paramedics. Mr Ponce said adrenaline then set in, so he raced back into the bloodbath and continued to help the dead and wounded. He claims he helped an elderly lady whose arm was nearly hanging off from a devastating gunshot wound evacuate the store, as a man he suspected was her husband lay dead beside her with a terrible headwound.  He claims he saw a man in a bulletproof vest he believed was the shooter running toward a mall as crowds began racing away. Mr Ponce said he still gets nightmares about the brutal scenes he encountered,. “I did what I could, he told the Times.At that moment, I wasn’t thinking of anything. ... The scene there looked like a horror movie. People with their heads blown off. Terrible. Terrible.” A fundraising page has since been begun for Mr Ponce in the wake of his actions, with people trying to raise money for the El Paso Walmart shooting hero.  El Paso police officials told US media that Mr Ponce probably saved several lives. He not only removed the baby from among the dead bodies, saving Paul from potentially being suffocated - he also ran the infant out of the store to le-saving emergency services. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, baby Paul became the centre of a high-profile photograph that prompted fierce backlash. Donald Trump was pictured giving the thumbs up as he and we Melania posed with the orphaned child and his family for the picture posted on the First Ladyaposs Twitter account.  The president had been met with protest in El Paso, as critics heaped scorn on the Mr Trump over his gun control policies in the wake of yet another deadly mass shooting. Paulaposs uncle later defended the presidentaposs actions, telling broadcaster NPR he and his late brother were both Trump supporters. Alleged gunman Patrick Crusius surrendered to authorities immediately following the shooting and claimed he had been targeting Mexicans.  The FBI is investigating the El Paso shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and potential hate crime. Authorities found a manesto online following the attack allegedly posted by Cruisus, that outlined right-wing conspiracy theories and referenced the deadly New Zealand mosque shootings that killed  worshippers last March.

The schoolgirl mum-to-be, named Daria, said partner Ivan is the father of the unborn child, and has received vile abuse since her situation was reported. Daria, who lives in the Siberian town of Zheleznogorsk, hit back after a doctor said Ivan could not have got her pregnant. Her mother Elena who is seriously ill with cancer, although she did not say what type. Elena also said that she found out about the pregnancy by chance. She said: Initially, we thought she had food poisoning, but slowly we started to realise that whatever was happening had nothing to do with her belly. We then bought a pregnancy test and it showed up positive. Elena said that she never considered making her teen daughter Daria have an abortion despite her own circumstances, adding that she would be concerned that she would not be able to have children in later le, as can sometimes happen.  Elena also added that despite her terminal-stage cancer, she plans to stay around as long as possible in order to take care of the baby in the future, adding: Now I have a reason to live. After the story was widely covered by the media, the young parents said that it has become dficult for them to venture out in public. The -year-old mum-to-be said: People call me a w**** and accuse me of sleeping with everyone around. Meanwhile, a doctor claimed that the -year-old aposfatherapos is too sexually immature to produce sperm and there are rumours that the pregnant teen had other lovers around the same time. Dr Evgeny Grekov, a urology and andrology expert, said: We rechecked the laboratory results three times so there cannot be any mistake. There cannot be sperm cells. He is still a child.

American merchant steamer the SS Cotopaxi has long been the subject of many conspiracy theories and hoaxes after seemingly vanishing without a trace during a routine voyage in . The disappearance has helped fuel the legend of the Triangle, a notorious section of the western North Atlantic where numerous vessels and aircraft have seemingly vanished in bizarre fashion. The fate of the Cotopaxi, which left Charleston, South Carolina, on November , , heading for Havana, and the  people on board has baffled experts - but now it seems the answer has been there for years.Marine biologist and underwater explorer Michael Barnette, speaking to Newsweek, said: We know that on that voyage something happened because she delivered a mayday message early December saying sheaposs in distress.And then that was it. They never found any wreckage. They never found any leboats, bodies or anything. The vessel just disappeared after that point. So weaposve been trying to determine what happened. The ship was famously aposdiscoveredapos in the Gobi Desert in classic  Steven Spielberg movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, having been supposedly placed there by aliens. While reports in  claimed it had reappeared near a restricted military zone off the coast of Cuba, though this was dismissed as a hoax.  But nearly a century on since its last confirmed sighting, Barnette and his team claim they located it  miles off the coast of St Augustine, on Floridaaposs northeast coast. And the supposed surprise discovery will feature in an episode of Shipwreck Secrets on the Science Channel in February. Barnette is prolic in his discovery of lost ship wreckages and said while all history has always fascinated him, maritime history is my real passion. I like going out and trying to identy wrecks because every one has a fascinating story. Iaposm just a very curious guy, he added. While digging in the archives of Lloydaposs of London, the explorer found documents proving the Cotopaxi sent out a distress signal on December , , something historians had not known previously. A lot of times, itaposs more important to spend more time in the archives researching than it is on the water, because thataposs when you will make the discoveries in all these articles for insurance or things of that nature, Barnette said.  The signals were picked up in Jackonsville, Florida, meaning the ship must have sent them near the famous aposBear Wreckapos off the coast of St Augustine, a thriving port in colonial times - which is littered with shipwrecks. But while most of these are from the th and th centuries, the Bear Wreck - whose real name and background are unknown - is likely from as recent as the early th century and is further off the coast. Diver Al Perkins has been exploring that wreck for  years and collecting ious objects as he goes - including a valve manufactured by a company based just a few miles from Ecorse, Michigan, where the Cotopaxi was built. He gave the valve to Barnette during his investigation who then conducted move es to collect measurements of the Bear Wreck to compare them to the original Cotopaxi plans. He found they were a match before documents were found at the National Archives of New York in relation to a legal case families of the missing crew had brought against the shipaposs operator - the Clinchfield Navigation company, arguing the ship was unseaworthy.  As part of his testimony the company president specied the last known coordinates on November , , which Barnette plotted putting the doomed vessel  miles north of the Bear Wreck on that last date. The co-ordinates appeared to have the Cotopaxi on its expected course to Havana.While according to weather records, a large storm struck the Florida coast on December , which could have sunk the vessel, which would explain the distress signal,it had stayed on course from the previous day.Barnette said: We approach all these shipwrecks kind of like a cold case murder case, right  You know, you have the body there. You try and gain whatever information you can. Thereaposs a whole bunch of tools that we use to try to identy these wrecks. He described the realisation that the Bear Wreck was probably the Cotopaxi as like a jolt of electricity.

It was a bad one. We really never expected it.#The charity believe that Bruce#s former owners were aware that he had swallowed the foreign objects and failed to let them know.Elizabeth said: #I wish they had told us beforehand.#We would have still taken him, butwe#d been told before that he#d eaten those objects we could have removed them through surgery and he might still be here today.#The volunteer also urged people to know what they#re getting into when buying exotic pets.She added: #People need to research. Tegus like Bruce need a lot of specic care and attention, as well as lots of space since they get so big.#They#ve got really long le spans and people don#t know that. They buy them as a novelty without realising that they can live  or  years.#A lot of people would never treat a cat or a dog they way they treat a lizard or a snake.#People need to research the animal they want to get. Don#t buy anything thinking that it#s going to be easy and won#t take a lot of time.#The charity is now raising money to pay for the £ worth of vet bills that looking after Bruce racked up.The group has created a fundraising page in order to pay the bill, which can be accessed through their Small Scales Reptile Rescue Facebook page."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49778915-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49778915-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49778915-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49778915-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee seal loan return for goalkeeper conor hazard","story":"Dundee have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Conor Hazard on loan from Celtic for the rest of the season.The Northern Ireland international played five games for the Dark Blues in an emergency-loan spell earlier in the campaign and s to challenge Jack Hamilton for the No  jersey.Hazard arrived from the champions in October when Hamilton needed surgery after suffering from appendicitis and impressed during his short time at the club.He played in wins over Ayr, Alloa and Morton before heading back to his parent club in November."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/SNS-19792685-Dundee-Utd-Media-Access-940x520.jpg ","title":"dundee united out to show their credentials tonight against hibs in cup replay","story":"Peter Pawlett says Dundee United are determined to show their Premiership credentials at Easter Road tonight.The runaway Championship leaders face a dferent sort of test as they travel to a Hibs side sitting sixth in the top flight.With a place in the fth round of the Scottish Cup and a tie against BSC Glasgow up for grabs, the Tangerines head to the capital on the back of a -game unbeaten streak.That included the first meeting between the sides at Tannadice, where United fought back twice to level through first Lawrence Shankland and then Louis Appere .Despite holding their top-flight opponents, Pawlett reckons the Tangerines can play a lot better this evening.He told the Tele: “Tonight is a big game for us and one we are all looking forward to.“We want to show what we are capable of and get the right result.

We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process.

All week we’d been really positive so we need to go back and build on that for the next game.“I think I showed them my game – bit of pace, drop the shoulder and get a ball into the box.“Cutting in and having a shot as well, that’s the type of player I am.“I’d been playing with the U s at Wigan, Dundee came down to watch me in the Liverpool game a couple of weeks back.“I done well, we won the game and that’s where the interest came from. I’m really happy to be here.“I don’t know much about Scotland or the league but I know it’s a really competitive ision.“Hopefully, I can make an impact by getting a few goals and assists.” vw, px\"  Although not clued up on the Scottish game, Crankshaw is no stranger to the blood and thunder approach having cut his teeth in non-league football after being released by home town club Preston North End and then Morecambe.His route to Dens Park has taken in such footballing-hotbeds as Ramsbottom United, Clitheroe, Colne and Curzon Ashton but Crankshaw believes that has made him the character he is today.“My pathway has been dferent to a lot of other players but I think it shows that I’m hard-working, dedicated and just want to play football really,” he added.“Most people come through the youth ranks but I’ve went my way and it’s a little bit dferent.“Hopefully, I can get where I want to be and have a career in the game. I’ve seen the worst of it but I think that builds you and carves your career.“It builds you as a player to not take anything for granted. You can drop out of the game but,you work hard, you can make it back.”Given their toils of late in the Championship, Crankshaw believes that drive to turn things around is something the Dark Blues can employ to get their season back on track.“We need to find some consistency. I think we’ve definitely got the squad to go and push for promotion.“We need to put a run of games together and get back to winning, where Dundee should be.”He has been made to feel at home in Dundee despite not knowing many people, and is even flat-sharing with back-up goalkeeper Calum Ferrie, as he gets used to the city’s football culture.“All the squad have been really good with me, introducing me to everyone.“I came up late Thursday night and the manager met me. He’s been really good with me.“Everyone’s made me really welcome so, hopefully, we can get back to being confident and up there.

There are already a lot of parking issues with the offices.“If this development is approved there could be another , people living in the area and it is only going to make the problems worse.”He added: “Nobody wants these flats. I have not heard anybody say one positive thing about them.”Carterra already has planning permission to build  flats at the site, but the plans would see the number more than doubledthey are approved.Local resident Michelle Wilson, , added: “I just think it’s mad. The effect is going to be massive in so many ways.“It’s going to have a huge impact on the infrastructure in the area. The traffic situation is bad as it is without throwing another , people in there.”Carterra previously submitted plans to build  homes on the land but those proposals were rejected by Aberdeen City Council having attracted nearly  objections from the public.A subsequent appeal to the Scottish Government was also thrown out.One man who attended the meeting said representatives from the firm had been “hammered” at a meeting on the previous application.And local businessman Hugh Black, one of the owners of the quarry and a prominent campaigner against the development, called on members of the public to make their views on the plans known.He said: “There have not been as many objections to these plans as there were to the initial ones and it is a concern that will mean it is approved.“We need to make sure the public make their voice heard.”Carterra declined an invitation from the community council to send a representative to the meeting to address residents’ concerns directly.Anyone wishing to make a representation for or against the proposal should do so by the deadline of February .Local councillor Martin Greig, who attended the meeting, said: “I would encourage anyone with a view to make sure they participate in the consultation.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/SNS-19808197-St-Mirren-v-Aberdeen-115x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"northern goal the north of scotland football podcast from the evening express and press and journal","story":"Northern Goal is the north of Scotland football podcast from the Evening Express and Press and Journal, with new episodes released every Tuesday.We’ll discuss all of the issues surrounding Aberdeen, Ross County, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Peterhead, Cove Rangers, Elgin City and the Highland League.Apple Podcasts: https:podcasts.apple gb podcast northern-goal idSpoty: https:open.spoty show yJamczTcjQbkEIEcQOr search “Northern Goal” in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces. Girls are also removed from school when they reach puberty because of the lack of safe facilities.Through Toilet Twinning, it costs £ to build a toilet for an inidual family and £ to provide a block of toilets for a school or a displaced peoples camp.To raise vital funds, the group will host a coffee morning at Ardrishaig Parish Church Hall on Saturday January  and invites everyone to go along as it #helps to change the world, one toilet at a time#."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,in  The Argyllshire Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved.

report by election co-ordinators Andrew Gwynne and Ian Lavery, but they did blame a glut of policies for confusing the public.While the MPs accepted there were ldquonegative views of the outgoing leader, there was little blame laid at any of his actions.The increase in membership to what was described as the partyrsquos largest number ever was revealed at an NEC meeting on Tuesday.

entered the election with a stance of holding another EU referendum on the options of Remain and a ldquocredible departure deal.The official report contrasted this policy with the ldquoendlessly-repeated clarity of the Toriesrsquo ldquomisleading promise to lsquoget Brexit donersquo.The ldquoprolonged uncertainty of Labourrsquos position took its toll on support as did its failures in advancing positive proposals for resolving Brexit in Parliament, the report said.This allowed Labour to be ldquounfairly painted as part of an ldquoobstructive establishment thwarting the

priorities and disorientated activists.It accepted there were growing ldquonegative views of the leader which were ldquostrongly affected by the Brexit crisis.ldquoThere is also little doubt that four

them.She also said she was now in a ldquolovely place having taken Twitter off her phone in an attempt to connect with the voters and not the ldquoWestminster bubble.The focus on the social media

ScotWind Leasing will present Scotland as an attractive destination for the signicant investment needed to deliver the scale of offshore wind projects we want to see.’Employment was on the agenda at Campbeltown Community Council’s meeting last week.Chairman Alan Baker said: ‘We discussed the unemployment in the area due to ious redundancies that were issued, namely at Campbeltown Creamery and CS Wind.‘It was felt that after the initial meeting at the MACC premises that nothing further has been forthcoming.‘There is also to be a meeting in March with Fergus Ewing MSP to discuss further action.’The Courier asked both Mr Ewing’s office and the press office at the Scottish Government but no one could confirm the meeting was taking place, or when, by the time we went to press."},{"url":null,"title":"valuable support offered to argyll businesses","story":"As Scotland#s national business advice service, Business Gateway helps thousands of customers to meet their business goals every year.

Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica.

When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

They are able to catch and release Atlantic salmon, and they are able to catch and retain sea trout, should they catch them.ldquoBut at the moment, because of the way in which we grade the rivers and because of the grading of some of the rivers in that estuary, they are not able to retain the salmon.Mr Main made the comments while giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee.He was questioned on possible exemptions for the haaf netters by Scottish Labour MSP Claudia Beamish, who represents the South of Scotland region.She suggested the ancient technique kills less fish because it doesnrsquot use hooks, adding: ldquoTherefore, is it not possible that the haaf netters could keep fish  Is that something yoursquove looked into Dr John Armstrong, director of Marine Scotlandrsquos Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, said he could ldquosee the logic to this.He told MSPs: ldquoThere wouldnrsquot necessarily be a need to take the fish out of the water, which is one of the key issues.ldquoBut anglers typically only catch in the order of  per cent of fish moving up-stream.ldquoAnd now, even of that % theyrsquore releasing %, in that order.ldquoSo therersquos very little damage from catch and release in angling, just by those numbers.ldquoIn terms of where we have rivers that are in poor conservation status, we really just donrsquot want fish killed Irsquom afraid.The Annan Haaf Net Project has been documenting those who still brave the icy waters with their nets, while the Devilrsquos Porridge Museum in Eastriggs, Dumfries and Galloway, is currently staging an exhibition on the practice.Haaf netter Barry Turner recently told the BBC: ldquoIt would be an act of vandalism, cultural and historic vandalism,this traditional activity which is unique to the inner Solway dies.ldquoPlease save us, wersquore desperate for protection. Wersquore unique, wersquore only  people.

Until the UK-EU free trade agreement, or no agreement, is known it is not possible to finalisea policy.However, contingency planning is sensible, and one possibility stands out ndash Scotland joining the European Free Trade Association .That guarantees access to the EU single market, but outwith its customs union and therefore able to exercise a great deal more sovereignty than is possible with EU membership.There is a big dference between asking the Scotsthey want the UK to remain within the EU, as in the  EU referendum, to asking them to vote for independence on the premise that an independent Scotland would re-join the EU whilst the rest of the UK remains out.The EU is a customs union.If Scotland joins that customs union whilst the rest of the UK remains out that would inevitably create a trade border at Gretna.At the very least, there would no longer be ldquofrictionless trade between Scotland and England. As with Northern Ireland, where a new border has been created between Ulster and mainland Britain on the Irish Sea, a parallel border arrangement would inevitably be required between Scotland and England in the event of an independent Scotland re-joiningthe EU.Depending on the outcome of the negotiations about to begin between the UK and EU on their future trading relationship, tarfs and quotas on trade may also be required between an independent Scotland and England to maintain the integrity of the EU customs union. By promising to re-join the EU after independence, the SNP would therefore be handing a gt to our Unionist opponents.They would weaponise the border issue in exactly the same way they did with the currency issue in the  Independence Referendum.The chances of winning the referendum would be unnecessarily and substantially weakened.These issues do not arisean independent Scotland is part of a free trade agreement but not in a customs union.

Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickensrsquos Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name :Anger as gardens left a mudbath by Edinburghs Christmas marketPrinces Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to ldquowild the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi.So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streetrsquos commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the cityrsquos development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers donrsquot want to afford. As they say, Rome wasnrsquot built in a day ndash but a theme park could be."},{"url":null,"title":"last call to nature fund applicants","story":"Nature enthusiasts are being encouraged to submit ambitious ideas to improve habitats, safeguard species and tackle the causes of bioersity loss.Applications are being invited for the latest round of the Bioersity Challenge Fund .But anyone applying will have to be quick – applications for this round must be received by midnight on Monday, February . The Bioersity Challenge Fundspecically encourages applicants with innovative projects that improve bioersity and address the impact of climate change, increasing the resilience of our most at-risk habitats and species and creating large areas of brand new or restored habitat.Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We all have a central role to play in combating bioersity loss and tackling the global climate emergency.“Bioersity loss and climate change are intimately bound together. Nature plays a key role in defining and regulating our climate and climate is key in shaping the state of nature.“People and communities who want to be at the forefront of pioneering work to restore our habitats, protect our species and promote nature can now apply for additional support through the Bioersity Challenge Fund.”Scottish Natural Heritage chief executive Francesca Osowska has been excited by the very high quality of applications received so far, and would love to hear even more bright ideas.“People know that climate change is a big issue but not as many know that bioersity loss is also a global and generational threat to human well-being,” she said. “Pollinators are a vital part of the building blocks of le on earth, and we need to support all of Scotland’s bioersity, from bees and butterflies to pondle and peatlands, because enriching our nature is also an important part of the solution to the climate emergency.“Nature is at the heart of what we do, and we will continue to deliver the transformational change needed to bring a nature-rich future for Scotland.”More information about the fund can be found at Bioersity Challenge Funddata-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The fire service is eager for us all to avoid the devastating consequences of white goods catching fire in our homes.\"  Fires caused by white goods are a daily occurence viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"10k of free shopping up for grabs at lidl","story":"Scottish Lidl shoppers are in with the chance to win #, of free shopping this Saturday .In celebration of the retailer’s th store opening on Burn’s Day in Cowdenbeath, the first  customers through the tills at all stores across Scotland will be in with a chance of winning £ of Lidl vouchers.Customers will receive an exclusive goody bag of Scottish products including a box of Deluxe Scottish Selection shortbread – with one in each store containing the lucky winning voucher.Alongside the competition, the retailer will stock over  Scottish favourites for under £ each from Saturday, including brands such as Mrs Tilly’s, Nairns and Baxters.Ross Millar, Lidl GB Regional Director - Scotland, said: “It’s a year of momentous milestones at Lidl as we celebrate our th year in Scotland and look forward to opening our th store on Saturday.“Since opening our first store in Scotland, we have built a network of over  Scottish suppliers and, as our estate grows across the country, we will continue to support local producers and proudly serve communities from Kirkwall to Stranraer.”The retailer is currently undertaking a fun-filled tour of music and food with Scottish singer songwriter, KT Tunstall.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpeg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Doric Board chair, Frieda Morrison, said the Doric Board was delighted to be able to support this terric range of projects from all across the North East.\"  Doric Boards New Year awardsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The partnership is part of a national drive preventing and eradicating violence against women and girls at a local strategic level.\"  Aberdeenshire partners set out plan to tackle Violence Against Women viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"good turnout for wildlife group event","story":"About  people attended the first meeting of the Bailies of Bennachie Wildle group recently.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For those who campaigned and voted for Brexit, this will be a cause for celebration. For others, our departure from the EU after more than  years will be a matter of despair.I didn’t vote for Brexit in the  referendum, but as a democrat I believe that the outcome of referendums should be respected.If I feel any emotion at all on Friday night, it will probably be one of relief, that we are finally making some progress in getting Brexit sorted, and the country is at last moving forward after three-and-a-half years of stagnation.: Brian Monteith: It is my last week as an MEP, here is what I’ll do: Why Brexit means we could be  times more at risk from dodgy chemicals – Dr Richard DixonFor too long, Brexit has dominated our national discourse.

Perth’s River Tay is transformed into a winter wonderland for the Riverside Light Nights event, while in Edinburgh the BurnsBeyond festival has an East Asian feel to celebrate the confluence of Burns Night and the Chinese New Year.Yet these global spectacles are accompanied by a hint of poignancy: by the time they finish next month, Scotland will have been taken out of the European Union, an international community that is as much about exchanging cultural experiences as it is about trade and policy.Brexit threatens to be catastrophic for Scotland’s creative and cultural sector. Outside the EU we risk being deprived of vital funding for cultural projects, and of the international talent that makes our festivals the envy of the world.With EU exit now a certainty on Friday, and with a no-deal withdrawal still a real threat on  December, I want to outline the steps the Scottish Government is taking to protect this vital sector and ensure that Scotland remains a dynamic, open cultural nation.: Brexit: How Scotland will be in big troubleEU migrants stop coming – Steve Cardownie: Edinburgh Fringe reviews:  shows about BrexitLet’s start by looking at just some of the benefits of EU membership. Thanks to free movement, the EU gives us access to a market of  million people who can come here freely to write, act, perform, or contribute to our cultural le in other ways. Being in the customs union allows our world-class musicians, bands and ensembles to tour across Europe without the hindrance of customs checks between borders.Cross-border cultural exchangesAnd of course, there’s the funding: the Scottish culture sector received at least £ million from the EU between  and , supporting  projects. Many of these were supported through the Creative Europe programme, the EU’s principle funding initiative for the European culture sector. From a festival of string music featuring the Scottish Ensemble alongside musicians from Germany, Estonia and Norway, to a dance and theatre project involving young people from countries including Scotland, Belgium and Denmark, these were projects which facilitated collaboration and cultural exchanges across borders. Many of them simply couldn’t have happened without the support of the EU.With our access to these benefits set to come to an end, today I’m welcoming leading figures from Scotland’s creative and tourism sectors to a round-table discussion to consider the best way the Scottish Government can support them as they prepare for the many implications of leaving the EU.Thousands of talented performersAmong the organisations represented will be the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, National Galleries of Scotland and the Scottish Contemporary Arts Network. These organisations stand to be affected by Brexit in a iety of ways. A fth of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra’s players are from where in the EU, for example, and will be impacted by the UK Government’s new immigration rules. I’m pleased to have the chance to hear from them directly about their specic concerns. I will also be making the case for Britain to remain part of the Creative Europe programme after Brexit, retaining a crucial source of funding for our creative sectors.On Saturday I’ll be helping to promote Scotland’s creative industries to a global audience at the th anniversary celebrations of Showcase Scotland at Celtic Connections. This event introduces international producers, directors and other music industry professionals to emerging Scottish artists, with the aim of securing global touring opportunities. Every year it partners with a dferent country, and this year will be Finland’s turn. As well as offering six Finnish bands the opportunity to perform in Glasgow, this is a chance to build on Scotland’s links with our European neighbours – links we will continue to support and build on in the face of Brexit.As the year progresses, attention will turn inevitably to the Edinburgh Festivals. These world-famous events involve nearly , non-UK participants – a third of whom are from the European Economic Area – drawing audiences of about . million and generating more than £ million in cultural tourism value every year. After Brexit we risk losing access to thousands of talented performers who help to make the festivals so successful.Visa problemsConscious of the potential impact on all UK festivals from the loss of free movement, I have invited representatives from the UK Government and the Welsh and Northern Irish administrations to a summit in Edinburgh to explore the problems festivals face in relation to UK visa and immigration policy.The current process for non-EU citizens is y, complex and costly, with attendees or organisers sometimes spending thousands of pounds on visas and associated costs for a visit that often only lasts a few days. With European performers now facing a similarly dficult process to be able to perform here, summit participants will work together to develop practical solutions for visiting artists and performers in what is likely to be an increasingly restrictive immigration system.The initiatives I’ve outlined here are just some of the ways we are seeking to protect Scotland’s creative and cultural sector from the worst effects of Brexit. Scotland may be leaving the EU, but we will remain a proudly European nation, and the Scottish Government is working tirelessly to ensure we continue to play a central role in the continent’s cultural le.Fiona Hyslop is Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs and the SNP MSP for Linlithgow©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood to vote today on plans for second scottish independence referendum","story":"The First Minister will argue her government has a \"clear mandate\" for a such a vote as she leads debate on Scotlands future.: UK nurses paid less because lsquocaring is what women dorsquoIt comes two days before the UK is formally due to leave the European Union - with the Scottish Government saying this marks a \"material change in circumstances\" from the  referendum - when Scots voted to stay part of the UK.As the UK heads towards the EU exit door, Ms Sturgeon will argue that independence could give Scots an alternative future in which they could still be part of Europe.Earlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson flatly rejected the First Ministers calls for Holyrood to have the power to hold a second independence vote.But the Holyrood motion, which could be passed with the backing of SNP MSPs and the pro-independence Greens, calls for the UK Government to reach an agreement with Scottish ministers \"on such a referendum taking place on a date and in a manner determined by the Scottish Parliament\".The SNP leader has already said she wants to have that ballot in the second half of this year.Ms Sturgeon said Wednesdays Holyrood vote gives the Parliament the \"opportunity to endorse a fundamental democratic principle - that this country has the right to choose its own future\".: Why Brexit could be catastrophic for Scotlandrsquos cultural sector ndash Fiona HyslopShe added: \"This week, Scotland will be pulled out of Europe against its will and without its consent - an event which marks a signicant and material change in circumstances since .\"Throughout the Brexit process, the views of the Scottish Parliament, and the people of Scotland, have been consistently ignored.\"This Government has a clear mandate - to exercise the right of this country to take its future into its own hands.\"That mandate comes directly from the freely exercised will of the people, and simply cannot be ignored or denied indefinitely.\"There are now fundamental issues of democracy at stake - quite simply, Scotland must have the right to choose its own future.\"Our proposal is for a referendum offering the people of Scotland the choice of independence to take place this year, on a date and in a manner to be determined by the Scottish Parliament.\"The signicance of todays debate should not be underestimated.

If a situation occurs outside anticipated parameters then electronic control can be useless. Aircraft have landed in the wrong place and landed unexpectedly at Sumburgh. In such circumstance everyone is safer when the situation is within view of a live controller in the airport tower. Such a lookout may also assist aircraft in dficulties, and react tovandalism and other hazardous outbreaks.They should do away with all that glass windows in the control tower as well as all the windows in control towers all over the world as they are clearly not needed. All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks!

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. An old ambulance found at a derelict property“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”A well lived in roomHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. Some of the items left behind“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”The scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening PrayerA photograph taken in Hilden Mill"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

She had previously been a Stormont Spad for eight years and has also served as a junior minister.She will be joined in The Executive Office by former hospital doctor and ex-Craigavon councillor Dr Philip Weir.He has previously worked as a Spad for three DUP Health Ministers - Edwin Poots, Jim Wells and Simon Hamilton.Stormont sources said that former Sinn Fein special advisers Stephen McGlade and John Loughran were likely toto their roles.Ms Little-Pengelly last month told the Belfastthat she hadnt decidedshe would remain in politics following the loss of her Westminster seat.She said she needed time to \"reflect and recharge\" after her defeat and to consider her next career move.The DUP woman also outlined her plans to head to the jungle to volunteer with an animal wildle sanctuary.She said she hoped to spend a few weeks working in an orangutan sanctuary in Borneo.\"I think it will be a really interesting challenge and I want to learn about animal sanctuaries and conservation,\" Ms Little-Pengelly said.She was special adviser to both the Rev Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson in the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister from -.She then ed to Stormont as a South Belfast MLA and was appointed a junior minister in The Executive Office, but lost her seat two years later.She was elected South Belfast MP in  but was defeated by Ms Hanna in December.Spads have secured salaries of up to £,. Mr Allisters bill seeks to reduce the maximum salary to around £,.It would also create a specic criminal offence for a minister or special adviser to communicate confidential government information to a third party.Finance Minister Conor Murphy last week published an updated code for Spads but Mr Allister believes this doesnt go far enough.The new code includes an £, salary cap. The three broad paybands for Spads - up to £,, £,-£, and £,-£, - will be set independently by Department of Finance officials.The new code makes it clear that ministers are responsible for the appointment, conduct and discipline of Spads.It will also require special advisers to declare details of gts and hospitality and meetings with external organisations, to keep good records, use official email accounts and serve the Executive as a whole, as well as their appointing minister."},{"url":null,"title":"solidarity people before profit pledges free transport in climate action plan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The numbers of cars on the road have massively increased over the last decades.“This is because there were massive cuts to our public transport system during the austerity years, most of which has not been reinstated in terms of the numbers of buses on the roads and the numbers of trains on the tracks and the frequency of buses and trains.“One of the radical policies we’re proposing is free and frequent public transport and that would actually help to alleviate the huge problem with our inequality, to reduce our emissions.“It will also improve the lives of people, improve their health and improve the quality of their lives.”The party said it opposes the implementation of a carbon tax because it said that most of the houses in the State are poorly insulated.“We need a huge overhaul of how the SEAIhave given out the grants for retrofitting,” Ms Smith added.“It is absolutely and completely inadequate. The question of retrofitting is an expensive question, but it can be funded through the public purse and it will save money because it can reduce by more than half the energy that’s being spent in a home.”Richard Boyd Barrett said that Solidarity-People Before Profit has the best record of putting forward radical environmental and climate change policies in the Dail.“I challenge anybody to disprove it because being green isn’t a colour, and it’s not a political brand,” he said.“It’s about actually proposing and fighting for measures that will make a dference, and I really feel the public are owed the truth about these things.”He said the party “spearheaded pretty much alone to fight to stop the sale of our public forests, which had been agreed by Fianna Fail and the Greens, and was then attempted to be implemented by Fine Gael and Labour”.In a bid to target Green voters, Mr Boyd Barrett said thatthe public want radical climate measures, Solidarity-People Before Profit is offering that radical agenda."},{"url":null,"title":"56 lloyds halifax and bank of scotland branches","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Western Trust has revealed that its final business case will be handed over to the Department of Healthfor approval in February. Last February, the Trust entered an “initial” twelve-month agreement with site owner the Department for Communitiesto enable the Trust to further develop the proposal of locating a new Cityside Health and Care Centre at Fort George. During that time no further marketing of Fort George took place. The DfC has however said that once it receives the complete business case it will consider the best way to “maximise” the site’s potential. googletag.cmd.push A Western Trust spokesperson commented: “The Western Health and Social Care Trust can confirm that as part of the business case development process for the provision of a major city side health and care centre, it has been engaged in the identication of a site suitable for the purposes of bringing together GP and associated healthcare services in an integrated model. “Fort George is likely to be the recommended site deemed suitable for future service provision within the city. “The Trust and Department for Communities have entered into a joint Memorandum of Understanding allowing the Trust to progress the completion of the business case and to secure the necessary Departmental approvals. googletag.cmd.push  The development of a Cityside hub is anticipated to bring up to  whole time equivalent permanent jobs, new and relocated, which will deliver mostly nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles. It would enable both Trust and GP Medical Practices to work together to further expand and enhance local health and social care services currently spread across the city. If delivered, the hub is expected to support people in improving their health and well-being, particularly around the areas of physical activity, nutrition, smoking cessation, alcohol misuse and mental health. Once established, it would optimise the potential of communities to become more active in improving their own health and well-being. ‘No timescale’ At a Derry City  Strabane District Council meeting in November , a new project was put on the table for a poundm - poundm multi-purpose development at the Fort George site. This would comprise of a “world-class” Maritime and Emigration Museum, -star hotel, public realm development, office space incorporating a technology and research  development hub, plus two residential blocks with car parking at the former army base. Speaking at that meeting, well-known Derry businessman, Garvan O’Doherty said projects brought forward by the city lacked ambition and with central government support the museum could be the fourth major tourism pillar in Northern Ireland alongside Titanic Belfast, The Giants Causeway and the Wild Atlantic Way. He felt the health hub could be located at a dferent site, adding, it is imperative to look after both the economy and people of the city. A Department for Communities spokesperson explained that it is awaiting the Western Trust’s final business case before considering the best way forward for the site but could not put a timescale on that process. He said: “The Department is awaiting receipt of the final Business Case from the Western Health and Social Care Trust but officials have been regularly engaging with the Trust and signicant progress has been made. “Once the final Business Case has been received, consideration will have to be given to the optimum way to develop Fort George. At this stage we do not have a timescale for when that decision will be made.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

Following the meeting with representatives the utility said the main towns of Cookstown, Dungannon and Magherafelt have been identied as a focus for population and economic growth to promote sustainable development and to support the efficient use of public services, facilities and infrastructure.But NI Water has warned that it can only spend within its annual public expenditure budget and plans for water and wastewater can only happenthey are funded.Steve Blockwell, Head of Investment at NI Water said:“Since the presentation was given to Mid Ulster Council, I would like to welcome the New Decade, New Approach Deal and the Executive’s commitment to invest urgently in wastewater infrastructure which is at or nearing capacity in many places across Northern Ireland, including Belfast. “Providing safe, clean, drinking water supplied to houses and business is always the top priority for NI Water. While we have been able to maintain safe clean drinking water, the huge constraints on our capital budget has meant that Wastewater issues have largely been left unaddressed as highlighted in our PC Business Plan our PC business planning process has identied ninety-nine areas where new housing and businesses may be unable to get connected to our sewerage system throughout the province.”“The funding made available in PCby NI Government to date for water and wastewater infrastructure is not keeping pace with what Northern Ireland needs.“Signicant investment is needed for wastewater and water infrastructure. NI Water knows Northern Ireland’s growth ambitions, we know what needs done and we have the plan and the skills to deliver it. However,funding continues at current levels there will be signicant constraints on economic growth, damage to the environment and risk to people’s health.” googletag.cmd.pushIf you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has proved to be an exhilarating not just for the young people involved, but for their parents and the coaches. “Any sort of coaching is good but you get a better feeling from something as unique as this knowing that you are helping these kids,” McKeever said. googletag.cmd.push  Group pictured at the Football for Visually Impaired Kids held in Templemore Sports Complex. Included on left, is Danny Hutcheson and on right, Chris McKeever, coaches.  “Sometimes people are a bit wary of it, thinking that because there is visual impairment and because football is a contact sport it might not be the best thing, but the unique training and the way we go about this means that the kids are gaining confidence. “The parents see that as well and we are always trying to get more kids to come and join in to experience this.” At present, the Wednesday night session is the only class of its kind in the city, but with the right support, McKeever, Hutchman and everyone at Trojans is hoping that Visually Impaired football can become a permanent fixture locally.“Its unique to Derry,” Chris agreed. “I know there is Visual Impairment football in Belfast now and that has really taken off. “It didnt take off overnight however, it does take time and thats what were trying to get here. “We need as much support as possible. The parents are % behind us and they do see the dference to in the kids that come to us.“At the minute we rely on a lot of word of mouth. Weve been around a few primary schools and we have posters up. “We are promoting it also on the Trojans Facebook page but a lot of it comes down to word of mouth. We have also been to the RNIB and they have put a poster up in the eye clinic in Altnagelvin Hospital just so people are aware what is there for the younger kids.” A year in it may be, but the development of the scheme is still in its initial stages and McKeever sees great potential for the expansion of the class, not just locally, but nationally.“Our aim is just to give kids with Visual Impairment the same opportunity as other kids,” he explained. “In the long term we would love to get a league goingother teams were thinking about it as well. Theres no reason why kids with visual impairments cant get into football and learn the sport. “Im sure there are kids with us who have brothers and sisters playing for football teams and maybe they feel they cant do it because of visual impairment butwe can get a league going that gives everyone the opportunity. Hopefully that is something we can start to look at from the start of next season, maybe even having a friendly against the team in Belfast, just to get the word out there about it.” googletag.cmd.push Humble beginningsVisually Impaired Football first started over a year ago when Trojans coach Gerard Bradley was contacted by his sister Kathleen about the possibility of starting a class for her two children and others with similar challenges. Bradley wasted no time in getting to work and with the support of the Irish Football Association, who provided coaches, equipment and time, the first foray into the world of Visually Impaired sport in Derry began.Bradley is no longer directly involved in the coaching side, passing the baton onto McKeever and Hutchman but his experience in Visually Impaired football is one which has stayed with him.“We can taken everything for granted but its amazing what some of these kids come through,” he said. “The course is going grand and theres a good attendance every week. “We have specialist footballs which dont bounce but other than that its just normal football and normal coaching sessions. There are dferent kinds of vision problems involved. There are also glasses which imitates what someone with visual impairment sees and it really is interesting.” Sponsorship neededTrojans are hoping to continue the weekly classes and the help of a new sponsor will ensure that those local kids with visual impairments can continue to enjoy the benefits of their Wednesday night sessions. “Were keeping this scheme free,” Chris added. “We dont charge the kids coming down but we are looking for as much support as possibleanybody in the community wants to get in contact to offer support. Were trying to keep it a free scheme and were happy enough doing that butwe were able to get a sponsor on board that would really help everyone involved.”The VI football training takes place every Wednesday night, between  and pm at Templemore Sports Complex and is open to all children with a visual impairment.

Nilson became Derry Citys sixth new signing and arrives just in time with the new season less than three weeks away. The striker comes highly rated with Devine extremely enthusiastic about bringing the -year old to the club. A lot of people would have seen him on Wednesday night, but the work was done well before that and it didnt matter how he did, because we wanted to bring him to the club, he said.Hes a proven player, a proven number nine, that has played at a very high level and from our point of view as staff we think hell only enhance the group moving forward,” he stated.Centre-forwards are like hens teeth at the minute, they are very dficult to get no matter what level you are at. “There are absolutely none in Ireland that are at Tims level.For us we had to make sure that we brought a number nine to the club that was a top level player and we are delighted today because we feel that we have done that by bringing in a top, top level player and I think moving forward Tim will be a fantastic signing for us.”Devine admitted that the club had been working hard to get the deal for Nilsson over the line, and the manager was at pains to keep the strikers name out of the headlines to avoid other clubs becoming aware of their interest.We have been looking at Tim for about four weeks but things only started moving about  days ago,” he explained. “First of all, when these things happen, you have to find outthe willingness from the player is there. Thankfully it was. “You then have to deal with dferent types of people in terms of trying to make the deal work and when we showed him about, he was very positive.We were very, very keen to get him to the football club and we had to do our business kind of quietly becauseTim Nilsen was out there in terms being available I think there would have been a lot of other clubs other than Derry City also tracking his movement, so thankfully we got our business done really quickly.” googletag.cmd.push Next appearanceNilsson gave City fans a glimpse of what he will bring on Wednesday past and is sure to be involved against Institute, with the striker keen to get minutes under his belt.He wanted to take part in half the game,” Devine stated. “It was probably more so for him to see the way that we went about our business and the style of players we have, but it was irrelevant whether his performance was of a good level, because for us it was all about getting him into the number nine jersey and thankfully hes in it now and hopefully hell stay in it for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those fans who were in attendance at the game against Finn Harps last Wednesday saw the former Waterford player star in the - win, a game also notable for two goals from new striker Tim Nilsson and a fine strike from new signing Stephen Mallon. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Derry City player Ciaran Coll Declan Devine has hinted that Figueira will play a forwards role in the new season and having watched the talented Londoner in action for a few weeks now, Coll is as excited as any fan about what he can bring to the team this season.“Seeing him in training you dont know what way hes going,” he laughed. “Hes tricky but its good to see the likes of Walter here at the club. “Last year he was playing with Waterford and he gave us a bit of trouble but its good to have him here now. Hes flying in training and give him the ball to feet and you dont know what way hes going to go, left or right, or straight through.”The addition of Walter is arguably the highlight of the six new faces who have joined the club in recent weeks, but with the highly-rated Nilsson now joining the likes of Mallon, Conor Clford, Conor McCormack and Colm Horgan, Coll believes there is no reason why City cant push for an even better year in .“We finished last year on a high and we qualied for Europe and we just dont want to be looking back,” he insisted. “We want to kick on from where we stopped last year. “We want to push on for the top of the table, we want to be right up there. Theres Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers there but we want to push for that place where theyre at.“Its pre-season still and were a couple of weeks in so the games mean a lot. We just want everyone to get  minutes under their belts and keep working hard. “We have been working hard over the few days and the trialists have been in and one of them scored two goals, and Stevie as well whos just in the door scored after a great build up. Hopefully the god times are happening for us.”City have won both pre-season games so far without conceding a goal, and whilst the victories have been welcome, Coll believes that match sharpness and fitness at this time of year is the priority.“Its good to get  minutes under your belt, especially on our own patch,” he continued. “It got the rustiness out of us so hopefully now we can just kick on again for the next one.“Last year I had a very good season and hopefully or myself and everyone , I can kick on and dont look back and just keep going forward and working hard.”A key factor in Citys success last season was the emergence of young players like Jack Malone, and Coll believes that there is enough experience in the current squad to help ensure that any young player breaking through has enough support going forward into .“You have to take it on a wee bit and help the younger boys through and keep pushing everyone,” he stated. “There is that bit of experience there with Peter, Gerardo, big Eoin Toal and Ally, so theres plenty of experience there. “We just have to keep everyone on board and keep working hard.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development.

Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting. The generosity of spirit that local people have displayed since my first appeal continues to be overwhelming..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Red.jpg","title":"Red High back in business  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, booked their place in the MacLarnon Cup play-offs against Carndonagh Community School and are now just one win away from the quarter-finals.The holders didnrsquot start that well as St Louisrsquo grabbed the first two points through Aidan Scullion at the Dub last Wednesday, but as the first half progressed it became clear that St Patrickrsquos were the more accomplished team.Although St Louisrsquo still led at the break by - to -, the writing was on the wall for the mid-Antrim boys with the pace of the Downpatrick wing-forwards and wing-backs, plus the presence of Aodhan Harney, Tom Smyth and Ruairiacute Connor down the centre was always a problem for them.St Louisrsquo looked good in the opening few minutes with Scullion lively and Ruairiacute Hagan and Ryan McQuillan pushing forward, but that penetration was arrested before the end of the first quarter and the scores dried up.Their hopes of remaining in the tie against the strong breeze in the second half rested on a penalty in first half injury-time when Ronan McKillop fed Ryan McQuillan and the Glenravel man was taken down.But Scullion pulled his shot wide from the spot kick and that two points lead did not look good enough.Tom Smyth, Tom Savage, Chris McIlroy and Dermot Donaldson all pointed in the opening six minutes of the second half and the result was not in doubt from then on.Some of these were well taken scores, but the cream of the crop was a seven-player move down the left wing which finished with Conor Murray slinging over the second of his four second half scores in the nd minute.Six minutes later the Red High slammed the door shut on Ballymena.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers. This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsParents dipping into kids savings to supplement everyday living costsBy Group ReporterTuesday, th January , : pm\"\"Parents are dipping into their kids savings to supplement day-to-day living costs, a study has found.Researchers polled , mums and dads and found one fth have borrowed money from their childrens piggy banks and accounts in order to pay their living expenses.Nearly half of those have taken cash out of their little ones savings to pay household bills, with  per cent borrowing money to cover the cost of groceries.And, ironically, more than one sixth have done so in order to cover childcare.The research was commissioned by comparethemarket as part of their latest Parentdex report on pocket moneyJody Coughlan, Money Manager, at comparethemarket said: \"Fortunately for kids, the wider squeeze on the household budget seems to have had little impact on the generous amounts parents wants to give their children.\"That said, parents do need to ensure that they are able to give their kids this pocket money, without needing to dip into it to cover wider household bills.\"The report uncovers the spending habits of British children who receive an average of £ a month, totalling £ every year and giving them the equivalent of £.billion to spend collectively.Research also found kids savings accounts are relatively healthy, with the average child having a signicant £. stashed away.In fact, one fth of children have £, sitting in their savings.It also emerged children are generating a second source of income, with four in five parents giving their offspring extra money to cover unforeseen requests such as new clothing or nights out with friends.These ad hoc requests see one fth of parents topping up pocket money once a fortnight, and more than a quarter giving these extra handouts once a month.Meanwhile, the Bank of Gran and Grandad appears to be another fruitful source of income for kids.One quarter of grandparents find themselves contributing to kids income, with two thirds giving their grandkids generous handouts as and when they see them.Unsurprisingly, children in the capital are the recipients of the highest amount of pocket money compared to anywhere  in the UK, with the average parent in London giving £ to their child each month.In contrast, children in the east of England are given £ a month while those in the south west who are given £.Fortunately, the poll also shows mums and dads are confident in their childrens ability to manage their finances effectively, with almost three quarters believing the youngsters will be well equipped to handle money as they approach adulthood.In the absence of financial education at schools, this could be down to discussions at home, with nine in  stating they have talked about money management with their children.However, parents clearly feel their children would benefit from additional teaching in schools, with four fths of those polled believing schools should do more to teach financial education.Jody Coughlan added: \"Its incredibly encouraging to see the number of parents who are willing to talk to their children about financial management from such an early age.\"Not only will this do more to prepare them for financial responsibility in the long run, but it should also help to lessen their long-term dependence on the Bank of Mum and Dad as a result!\"\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\"

according to new figures.By The NewsroomTuesday, th January , : pm\"\"Janaury has proved a dficult month for retailersThe CBI’s monthly distributive trends survey showed that retailers saw sales volumes flatline for the third month in a row.It said Britain’s high street will brace itself for “another tough year for the sector”, as it predicted sales would remain flat through February.Sales were “poor for the time of year”, the CBI said, predicting they will remain below seasonal norms for the year to February.Anna Leach, deputy chief economist at the CBI, said: “Both official data and business surveys are painting a picture of subdued activity for retailers.“A challenging Christmas has extended into the New Year, with little expectation of any improvement soon.”Department store sales were particularly good during the month, but were offset by weaker performances by DIY retailers and furniture shops.The survey data also revealed that orders placed with suppliers fell as retailers maintained high levels of stock.Stagnating retail sales will add to the uncertainties of the wider economy, ahead of Mark Carney’s final monetary policy committee as governor of the Bank of England on Thursday.The CBI also called on the Chancellor to stimulate the retail sector by overhauling the current business rates system.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said: “It is still early days to see what impact December’s decisive general election result and imminent UK exit from the EU on  January with a deal has on consumer behaviour.“The initial signs are that it has lted confidence but this - so far at least - has not translated into higher spending.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.
