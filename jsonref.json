Because instead of his projected 18 months, Graham\u0027s build dragged on for more than ten years — much of which he and Mandie, an NHS worker, spent living in an old holiday caravan in the garden with her two sons from a previous relationship and, from 2012, baby Eva, too.Blimey. All those years in a caravan in the garden, with two teenage boys and a baby? I am astonished Mandie is still here, let alone beaming so proudly, telling me how great he is and how very proud of him she is.\u0027It was surprisingly comfortable,\u0027 says Graham. \u0027We had heating and TV and an oven and everything.\u0027The saga started back in 2008 when, after snapping up a very dated bungalow in Ringwood, Hants, for about £240,000, a builder friend — \u0027a lovely bloke, I trust him\u0027 — persuaded Graham to knock it down and start again.         Now after spending a further £140,000, the house, pictured, is worth around £500,000         Graham studied DIY manuals and watched instructional videos on YouTube to complete the job         The job took a decade because Graham was completing the work on his own, while running his own IT business  \u0027He had a quick look round and said, \u0027You can do this, mate. It\u0027s not rocket science. Give it a go. If you get stuck, give me a shout.\u0027 \u0027Luckily, Mandie trusted Graham implicitly. Not just with their life savings, but also their home and the next decade of her life.Even so, the sight that confronted them the day after the bungalow was demolished (by local contractors for just £2,000) came as a bit of a shock. \u0027Suddenly, it seemed like a very big plot with no house on it,\u0027 he says. Mandie realised immediately that he would not keep to the timescale.\u0027The first year was mostly spent digging up the garden — just getting the pipes down took months,\u0027 she says. \u0027But it didn\u0027t feel helpful to say anything.\u0027Because while Graham worked whenever the light would allow, seven days a week (\u0027though very quietly, of course, at the weekends\u0027), he was also trying to run his IT business. \u0027So I\u0027d get up in the morning, mix up a load of cement, get my bricks ready and start,\u0027 he says. \u0027But when I\u0027d done ten or so bricks, my mobile would ring and I\u0027d have to jump in the shower and go on an IT job.\u0027And so things progressed — stop start, stop start — at snail\u0027s pace.Of course, most people don\u0027t literally build their own house. They bring in an architect, a project manager and a team of builders, electricians, plumbers and plasterers who work on it together.Not Graham. They had no spare money, so he did everything — and not just the work, but the planning, the ordering, the measuring, the negotiating, the heavy lifting and the worrying in the dead of night. Which was exactly how he liked it. There was a brief spell when Mandie\u0027s dad helped out — but not for long. \u0027He got the cement ratio wrong once, so he was out,\u0027 says Graham, firmly. Once, Gary from next door helped him swing the roof rafters in. Other neighbours lent him tools, advice and moral support. (\u0027Apart from one neighbour, they\u0027ve all been brilliant,\u0027 says Mandie.)         Finally though, after some prodding, he admits that he\u0027d love to do another renovation, if the opportunity aroseGraham has always been good with his hands and was never one to shy away from a challenge. Aged 13, when his parents refused to give him pocket money, he got a job in a local car body shop.When he was 18, he set up his own company, which he ran until he was 30. But he wanted more from life, so he taught himself about computers at home and duly set up an IT company. (It was while fixing the computer of a friend of Mandie\u0027s that the pair met.)\u0027I am very logical, I like following instructions,\u0027 he admits. So, he says, in an odd way building a house from YouTube videos and DIY books suited him perfectly.But even he couldn\u0027t have predicted the toll the build would take on his body — his bones, his joints, his brain, everything. \u0027When I started, I was in great shape but, somehow, the harder I worked, the more weight I put on. I never had time to go to the gym any more.\u0027Naturally, there were moments when it was all too much.When, for instance, Graham became tearful and overwhelmed. And when, before meeting his mates for a pint, he\u0027d ask them not to mention the house or to take the mick. (This had the effect of making them do it more.)The real pressure, he says, came from wanting to provide for Mandie. \u0027She was incredibly supportive, but I knew what I was putting her through, and I couldn\u0027t go any faster.\u0027 It didn\u0027t help when, all around them, neighbours\u0027 extensions rocketed up. \u0027They\u0027d say, \u0027I hope it won\u0027t inconvenience you\u0027 and the whole thing would be done in three months and we\u0027d go over and admire them and I\u0027d be like, \u0027Oh Mandie, I\u0027m so sorry.\u0027 \u0027She, meanwhile, had her own challenges — managing with two teenage boys in a small caravan, producing Christmas dinners from the tiny oven, dashing out in the rain to get peas from the freezer in the garage.\u0027I am very organised,\u0027 she says stoically. She\u0027d have to be. Two years into the build, Eva was born and, suddenly, there were four of them in the caravan.\u0027In many ways she made things better,\u0027 says Mandie.Then, in 2015, when Eva was three and the stairs were about to go in, Mandie was in hospital with back surgery — having two vertebrae fused — and came home to a building site to recuperate.So did she ever really blow — ever shout and scream and hurl pots and pans about?\u0027There were days,\u0027 she says. \u0027There definitely were days . . .\u0027When she wished it had never started, when she \u0027vented\u0027 to friends over a glass of wine about how long it was taking, about what a perfectionist he was.\u0027But I always knew that he had to finish it, otherwise he\u0027d just feel like he\u0027d completely failed. What was the point in getting halfway?\u0027 So to Graham, she\u0027d simply say: \u0027You\u0027re amazing, just keep going.\u0027He did his best, but there were endless delays — from rain, flu, long, cold winters and him wanting to get it right.Then, in 2015, he was offered a job he couldn\u0027t say no to as head of procurement for a care-home company and stopped work on the house for two years. A lesser woman would have walked out but, somehow, Mandie held it together — finding the silver lining at every setback and delay.Her faith was finally rewarded last April when they got sign-off on their five-bedroom home, complete with three bathrooms, a gym and a TV room in the garden, as well as a utility room-cum-garage.It might not be to everyone\u0027s taste, but Graham\u0027s attention to detail means the finish is exceptional — so good that officials asked him to enter it into the local authority building competition. \u0027That felt pretty good,\u0027 he beams.It has clean, perfect lines, empty surfaces, a mint-green bedroom suite and a gorgeous, girly bedroom for Eva, now eight. There is also a floating kitchen counter, slate-grey kitchen units, a computerised sound system and a vast downstairs wet room. Amazingly, Graham has no regrets. Not even the time it took. \u0027I can honestly say, there is nothing I would have done differently,\u0027 he says.The build cost about £140,000 and has produced a house worth nearly half a million, though they are reluctant to talk figures. They both insist it is their home for life.But I am not so sure about that. Because while Graham always vowed he would never do another build and deliberately sold or gave away all his building machinery to remove the temptation, he is already twitching.\u0027I love sitting on the sofa and looking up at my crisp lines,\u0027 he says. \u0027But I miss having something to do. It\u0027s like being on a treadmill, you can\u0027t just stop suddenly.\u0027So he has taken the engines out of both of their cars and replaced them.He\u0027s about to strip down an old bike and add new parts, and tells me how, every now and then, he gets on his hands and knees to buff his already immaculate grouting with a toothbrush.Finally though, after some prodding, he admits that he\u0027d love to do another renovation, if the opportunity arose.And somehow, after years of camping out in a caravan with three children in the garden, Mandie does not go bananas. She smiles proudly, and quickly clarifies: \u0027But not while we\u0027re living in it, next time . . . please.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"JANET STREET PORTER Canada cool Meghan Canadians choose live abroad","story":"Share this article This relatively young couple seem anxious to escape the restrictions of the UK monarchy, the snobbishness and small mindedness of some Brits - so picking somewhere far away - underpopulated Vancouver Island, with fir trees in every direction, freezing winters and a brief six week summer - might seem understandable.But in reality it\u0027s just plain weird. Instead of Lake Como, they\u0027ve got a rocky beach, with grey skies overhead. Instead of Venice Beach, Los Angeles, there\u0027s the local steak house. It\u0027s not as if they\u0027ve escaped the paparazzi - walking in a local park with Archie, Meghan was furious to discover a photographer snapping away with a long lens, hidden under a tree. Canada might have stricter privacy laws, but this couple will always be the subject of media attention, and to think otherwise is naïve.Perversely, Harry and Meghan have turned their back on celebrity hangouts (which come with well organised security) where pals like Serena Williams live - California or Florida, for example - and rented a mansion on the waterfront of South Vancouver Island built in a bland international style. It could be on Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, or in Chicago.From cute Frogmore Cottage with Windsor Castle down the road, ensuring access to a private chapel and millions of pounds worth of art, to this?          Prince Harry is pictured with baby Archie during his and Meghan\u0027s six-week Christmas break on Vancouver Island last year Their rented house certainly has pretentions to grandeur - 10,000 square feet of space, with a large guest house and 8 bedrooms, it features an imported 17th century fireplace, a games room, and a wine tasting cellar- sounding more suitable for the Beckham squad than Harry and his healthy-living wife and baby Archie.Perhaps growing up in a series of stately homes with servants around every corner might pall after a while (it wouldn\u0027t for me) but Harry and Meghan have opted for a lifestyle I can only describe as \u0027international first class departure lounge\u0027.Have we Brits really upset the Duke and Duchess of Sussex so much they prefer the hum drum existence of downtown Victoria, with it\u0027s limited choice of fine dining and trendy cafes? They\u0027ve turned their backs on the sarky humour of the Brits for the gush of clean-living middle class Canadians. This is a country where the press don\u0027t like to talk about politician\u0027s affairs in case it deters people from standing for public office!If Canada is so fabulous, how come so many famous Canadians live elsewhere?          The couple stayed in this $18million property on Vancouver Island, British ColumbiaBryan Adams lives in Chelsea, Ryan Gosling in Hollywood, and Celine Dion is either on the front row of a fashion show on Paris or singing in Las Vegas.My good friend is a Canadian film producer who admits that his countrymen\u0027s main drawback is an unfailing capacity to be nice, so nice in fact, you want to scream. He\u0027s chosen to live in London, where people are edgy, sometimes rude, and there\u0027s new art galleries, funky cafes and great theatre to stimulate and engage you.To spend six weeks (as the Sussex pair did over the Christmas holidays) on Vancouver Island surrounded by trees and a big television might be a novel experience. But would you opt to put down permanent roots in a country where satire is non existent? Where there\u0027s no Have I got News for You or Frankie Boyle?Meghan certainly enjoyed living in Toronto for seven years, but during that time she was constantly working on Suits and tended to hang out with her workmates. Toronto is hardly London, but it\u0027s the centre of the civilised world compared to Vancouver or Victoria. It\u0027s not as if the empty wide spaces of Canada produce clean-living youth. The average age they start drinking is 13 and there\u0027s a huge alcohol problem - maybe it\u0027s the lack of things to do.         They will still keep their Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor, but will start paying commercial rentI married a Canadian with family in Vancouver. To cope with my difficult mother-in-law, we spent our time fishing, sailing and staying in a log cabin on Gabriola Island.Never again. After you\u0027ve spent fourteen days walking up and down trails looking at nothing but pine trees, caught more fish than you can ever eat, and bought a sweater with a whale knitted on it, what else is there to do? Pooing in a composting toilet has scarred me for life - but I don\u0027t imagine that\u0027s something Harry and Meghan will be experiencing, no matter how keen they might be to establish their eco-credentials.How can this stylish couple opt for somewhere as unstylish and dreary as Canada? What cuisine has Canada given the world - apart from Maple syrup, bacon and a disgusting dish called Poutine, which consists of cheese curds, chips and brown sauce.Smiley Canadians also seem to have a secret chip on their shoulder, anxious that their country should be seen as equal to (if not better than) anywhere else in the world- particularly the UK and the USA.Some Canadian newspapers have stated that the ex-royal couple can\u0027t get too grand, because that would \u0027impinge on Canadian Monarchy\u0027 – I think they mean that Canada doesn\u0027t want anyone Royal upstaging their Prime Minister - yes, Justin Trudeau the man notorious for his inappropriate fancy dress and who blacked up not once, but at least three times during his college years.Harry and Meghan, it\u0027s not too late to come back home."},{"url":null,"title":"The world way track meeting climate targets","story":"Share this article Countries are expected to increase their action to tackle climate change.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said: \u0027We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for.\u0027This report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Eating healthily really DOES make glow pigments vegetables","story":"Share this article          The study, published in Frontiers in Psychology, said these pigments have a vital role in the body as anti-oxidants – neutralising toxins which would otherwise cause damage to the body’s structure.

Investigators found the sexual harassment occurred over the three decades he held senior positions at the companyThe LA Opera investigation, conducted by the law firm Gibson, Dunn \u0026amp Crutcher, said Domingo was one of 44 people interviewed and that the singer had \u0027denied all allegations of unwanted contact and maintained that all his interactions were consensual.\u0027The report added that investigators \u0027often found him to be sincere in his denials but found some of them to be less credible or lacking in awareness.\u0027It also said that investigators \u0027found no evidence that Mr Domingo ever engaged in a quid pro quo or retaliated against any woman by not casting or otherwise hiring her at LA Opera.\u0027Nancy Seltzer, a spokeswoman for Domingo, said he had no immediate comment on the findings.Two weeks ago, Domingo issued a pair of conflicting statements after the American Guild of Musical Artists concluded that he had \u0027engaged in inappropriate activity, ranging from flirtation to sexual advances, in and outside of the workplace.\u0027The union did not release specific findings but people familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity said that investigators found 27 people were sexually harassed or had witnessed inappropriate behavior by Domingo in the 1990s and 2000s. The incidents happened while he held senior management positions at the LA Opera and the Washington National Opera.In concert with the findings, Domingo apologized to the women who had accused him of misconduct, after denying the allegations for months. He said: \u0027I want them to know that I am truly sorry,\u0027 he said. \u0027I accept full responsibility for my actions.\u0027But two days later, as several Spanish organizations moved to cancel his appearances, he issued a second statement saying his apology had generated a false impression that he wanted to correct. \u0027I have never behaved aggressively toward anybody, nor have I ever done anything to obstruct or hurt the career of anybody,\u0027 he said.The cancellations in Spain were the first in Europe, where reaction to the misconduct allegations was more muted than in the U.S., where Domingo\u0027s performances were swiftly canceled.More cancellations have followed. London\u0027s Royal Opera House said in a statement last week it had mutually agreed with Domingo that he withdraw from a July production of \u0027Don Carlo.\u0027The Hamburg State Opera said Tuesday that Domingo had canceled planned appearances in late March and early April because of the coronavirus outbreak. The German company said the cancellation was due to medical recommendations stemming from his age and other factors and that it \u0027understands and respects this decision.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"The Queen decided stop shaking hands people foreseeable future","story":"Share this article England\u0027s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has said the death rate for people infected with coronavirus is \u0027significantly ramped up\u0027 among those over the age of 80.On Monday the Queen and other senior royals did not shake hands with dignitaries, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, during the annual Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey because of its policy to discourage the greeting.Prince Charles was seen to offer the Hindu \u0027namaste\u0027 greeting, holding the hands together in the prayer position and raising them.

It is understood some Lords are strongly opposed, as peers can only claim the tax-free £313 daily allowance when the House is sitting.Parliamentary officials also feared such a move could trigger a chain reaction in offices across the UK - effectively paralysing the country. Cabinet ministers have suggested it would be madness for MPs to continue to meet during a major outbreak, describing them as potential \u0027virus super-spreaders\u0027 as they travelled to and from their constituencies. Thousands of staff, officials and reporters work on the Parliamentary estate alongside politicians.            Concerns have been raised about the signal that would be sent by closing the doors at the Palace of Westminster There are particular concerns about how the virus could affect members of the House of Lords, who have an average age of 70. More than a hundred peers are over 80 years old.

He opted not to testify at his trial, but at sentencing he won\u0027t have to worry about getting grilled by prosecutors.Other women who\u0027ve accused Weinstein - including some who testified at his trial - are not permitted to speak at his sentencing under state law. One of those witnesses, Tarale Wulff, who accused Weinstein of raping her in 2005, said in a statement Tuesday that she will still attend and hopes that the sentence \u0027sends a clear message that times have changed.\u0027         In 2017, Affleck took to social media to condemn Weinstein\u0027s conduct and say it was \u0027completely unacceptable\u0027Weinstein was convicted on two counts: criminal sex act for the 2006 assault on the production assistant and rape in the third degree for a 2013 attack on another woman. On the criminal sex act count, he faced a minimum of five years in prison and a maximum of 25 years in prison, while the third-degree rape count carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison.Weinstein was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault stemming from actress Annabella Sciorra\u0027s allegations of a mid-1990s rape.He maintains his innocence and contends that any sexual activity was consensual.Newly unsealed documents show the 67-year-old former film producer sought help from billionaires Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg as sexual misconduct allegations against him piled up in October 2017, and that he considered issuing a statement at the time claiming that he was suicidal.There is no evidence to suggest either man responded.The New York case was the first criminal matter against Weinstein to arise from accusations of more than 90 women, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Salma Hayek and Uma Thurman. Many of Weinstein\u0027s accusers say he used his Hollywood prestige to befriend them, dangling movie roles to gain their trust.         Weinstein will be sentenced in New York City and faces a minimum of five years and a maximum of 29 years in prison Weinstein\u0027s lawyers are seeking the minimum sentence of five years in prison because of his age and frail health.Weinstein, who turns 68 next week, used a walker throughout the trial following recent back surgeries. After his February 24 conviction, he split time between a hospital and a jail infirmary unit, and had a stent inserted last week to unblock an artery.\u0027Given his age and specific medical risk factors, any additional term of imprisonment above the mandatory minimum - although the grave reality is that Mr. Weinstein may not even outlive that term - is likely to constitute a de facto life sentence,\u0027 Weinstein\u0027s lawyers wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed Monday.Once Weinstein is sentenced, he\u0027ll be transferred from the city\u0027s jail system to the state prison system. The agency that runs New York\u0027s state prisons said every inmate is evaluated to determine which facility meets his or her security, medical, mental health and other needs.Martin Horn, the city\u0027s former corrections commissioner, said Weinstein\u0027s celebrity status could make him a target for another inmate looking to make a name for himself, while the gravity of his convictions and sentence could raise suicide concerns.\u0027No jail wants to have the next Jeffrey Epstein,\u0027 said Horn, who now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u0027They\u0027re going to make sure that nothing happens to him while he\u0027s in their custody.

It is about all those who came to the UK, whether enticed by politicians such as Enoch Powell (who, before his infamous “rivers of blood” speech invited Caribbean women to come and work in NHS hospitals) or who were following family members who had already made the trip and settled. Many of these later arrivals were children, arriving on the British passports of their parents, who grew up to consider themselves as British, having little connection left to the countries they had travelled from.My debut novel This Lovely City begins in 1950, two years after Jamaican Lawrie Matthews has arrived on the Empire Windrush. After a rough start, he’s found a decent job as a postman, a place to live that, while not ideal, is better than many of his fellow countrymen have to put up with, and he’s fallen in love with Evie, the girl next door. When Lawrie is crossing Clapham Common one morning he makes a terrible discovery and finds himself accused of a heinous crime.In 2018, the Windrush scandal uncovered the shocking official treatment of Caribbean immigrants from that era. Two years on, reports of related injustice continue to surface. Another reason to read these books, which fill out the story of those who came to Britain in the first wave, and those who came after. 1. Small Island by Andrea Levy (2004)Probably now the book that first springs to mind when people think of Windrush novels. A book, a TV series, and most recently a play at the National Theatre, Andrea Levy’s novel is wide in its range, showing the viewpoints of four main characters over several years and three continents. To achieve what she does without the novel feeling over-long is a feat of genius in itself. Yes, there are a couple of handy coincidences, but the pay-off warrants it and I defy you not to cry at the end. A book that I have re-read many times for the wonderful characters.2. The Lonely Londoners by Sam Selvon (1956)On the opening page of Selvon’s iconic novel, Moses Aloetta is on his way to Waterloo station to meet a fellow Trinidadian, Henry, who has just arrived in England. Between the hopeful new arrivals and Moses’ homesickness, this is a novel about a community of people trying to survive in a strange city. I didn’t expect to identify with this motley assortment of men, but somehow I did. When Moses shows Henry – AKA Sir Galahad – how to get on, he is also showing the reader what it cost them to get by. The book also has one of the funniest scenes I’ve read, involving a pigeon, a starving Galahad and a little old lady.3. To Sir, With Love by ER Braithwaite (1959)An autobiographical novel about a well-educated Guyanese man who ends up teaching in an infamous secondary school in London’s East End, To Sir, With Love is probably best known for inspiring the Sidney Poitier film of the same name. The auhour’s alter ego Ricky Braithwaite is a qualified engineer and an RAF veteran of the second world war, but he finds it impossible to get a job in his field due to the colour of his skin. The author is as concerned with the lives of his pupils as he is with his protagonist’s struggles to get on in a city that seems determined to reject him. His experiences feel all too familiar, but there is a hopeful streak through the book, especially when the children get involved and teach Ricky that perceptions can be changed, not least his own low expectations of the kids.4. Mother Country edited by Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff (2018)Brinkhurst-Cuff has brought together the life stories of 22 people of Caribbean, heritage, covering seven decades of experiences. From MP David Lammy, to playwrights Natasha Gordon and Rikki Beadle-Blair, to publisher Sharmaine Lovegrove, these accounts are varied but give insight into what it is to grow up black and British, and how that can mean different things to different people.5. Familiar Stranger by Stuart Hall with Bill Schwarz (2017)Hall grew up in a middle-class Jamaican family in the 1930s before winning a scholarship to Oxford in the early 1950s. In his last book – he died in 2014, this book finished by his collaborator Schwarz), he tells of the struggle to reconcile a feeling that he belongs neither to Jamaica or to Britain. Most fascinating to me were his memories of a Jamaica still under British rule, where fair skin was prized above all else and the word “black” was taboo. As Hall quotes fellow Caribbean writer George Lamming: “Many of us first became West Indian in London.”6. War to Windrush: Black Women in Britain 1939 to 1948 by Stephen Bourne (2018)One of the few books to shine a light on the lives of black women coming to Britain from the Caribbean, Stephen Bourne also shares stories of those who were here already. From Una Marson, who arrived in Britain from Jamaica in 1932 and became an influential broadcaster at the BBC, to British-born women such as Shirley Bassey and Amanda Ira Aldridge, this is a wonderful exploration of black women’s lives in mid-20th century Britain. I found this an inspirational read, full of trailblazing women with ambition and character.7. Windrush Songs by James Berry (2007)Berry came to Britain from Jamaica in 1948. In the introduction to this collection of poems, he explains why he came to Britain and left a country he loved. Beginning in a City, 1948 in particular gives a strong impression of what Caribbean arrivals experienced in their first hours and days. The emigrant experience is often littered with contradictions, a major theme in my own novel, and Berry’s poems illustrate this perfectly.8. Surge by Jay Bernard (2019)Before Grenfell there was the New Cross Fire of 1981, a tragedy that was met by indifference from the government and the press. Bernard’s poetry collection was written after investigating the New Cross Fire records during their residency at the George Padmore Institute, a centre dedicated to radical black history in Britain. History resonates through these poems, not turning away from the horror but shining a light on it, as in the last line of Sentence: “Not rivers, towers of blood.” These are poems that never fail to move me.9. Voices of the Windrush Generation by David Matthews (2018)In the wake of the overdue scandal, several books have offered up accounts of the Windrush generation. Matthews explores the stories of ordinary people who came to Britain from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971. Removing himself from the narrative as much as possible, Matthews has assembled a book that aims to replicate an oral storytelling tradition. I loved reading these accounts, which felt fresh and honest.10. The Windrush Betrayal: Exposing the Hostile Environment by Amelia Gentleman (2019)Gentleman was the journalist who first exposed the scandal and has rightly won awards for her reporting. The book is dedicated to Sarah O’Connor, a Windrush victim who died before publication and whose story is now so sadly familiar. As deportations continue, sending people to countries they haven’t known since childhood and have no ties to, this is a difficult read but one that shouldn’t be shied away from.• This Lovely City by Louise Hare is published by HQ.

A spokesperson for the OfS said universities should “continue to follow advice from DfE and Public Health England”.However, vice-chancellors cautioned that the makeup of universities made their complete shutdown impossible.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Prof Steve West, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, said: “My bottom line back to government has been that they can’t treat universities like big schools because we aren’t. I’ve got 4,500 students living on campus: some of them are care leavers or estranged from their families and many are international students. We can’t just shut down as they would have nowhere to go.”The vice-chancellor of a university in the elite Russell Group, who asked not to be named, agreed, saying: “We couldn’t fully close. What do you do with thousands of international students who can’t go home?”The vice-chancellor said their university would provide free accommodation for international students who were stranded, even if the government told them to shut.UWE has set up an emergency helpline for worried students and parents. West said: “We would operate something like a Christmas shutdown. The things you can shut down you do, such as lectures and sports. But you also have to provide vital support services for the students still here, including security, catering, wellbeing support and emergency phone lines.”He added that universities may need to mobilise students who are training as nurses, doctors and other health professionals to help bolster voverstretched NHS services. “We need the flexibility to do that, and to support those students,” said West.Harvard University in the US told students on Tuesday that they must move out of their houses and student residences by no later than Sunday and that all classes would be conducted online after the spring holiday, in an attempt to contain the spread of the infection. No cases have yet been detected at the university. Oxford University said it would remain open despite a second student testing positive for coronavirus. In a statement it said: “Public Health England has advised the university that the risk to other students and staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue as normal.”Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at Oxford, said the volume of people in universities represented a real challenge to containment: “Only transport and inner urban streets clearly exceed the level of people-traffic that we can see in large universities. The end of term cannot come too soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e94cc56fe9e933654e5480db80402861cbd7b99/2_0_6247_3750/master/6247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9e525915918ea5b63f5331247e4965","title":"goth princess how the new it dress won over kate and everyone else","story":"The pretty but slightly perplexing dress is a hit with celebrities and royalty alike. Here’s why it is so popularAs our esteemed readers know, we at the  fashion desk do not make a habit of blanket coverage every time a duchess wears a dress to a thing. There are issues that demand rolling coverage in the news right now, and common sense suggests that Kate’s decision to wear, say, a tweed suit versus a wool coatdress on a given day’s charity visit probably isn’t one of those issues. But when she wore a sparkling green Vampire’s Wife dress, with that label’s distinctively dramatic emo-mermaid silhouette and frilled bracelet-length sleeves, it was a genuine moment. Every fashion-based WhatsApp group started blinking in unison the dress was headline news on Vogue soon after.Accessorised with a pint of Guinness during the first stop on the Cambridges’ tour of Ireland, this was a coronation. Not for Kate – for the dress. It was the moment that the Vampire’s Wife dress became an official It dress. Not since Cameron Diaz and Scarlett Johansson simultaneously swooped on Roland Mouret’s Galaxy dress in 2005 has one dress been so ubiquitous. After a lengthy under-the-radar campaign of red-carpet appearances, the Falconetti, which costs £1,595, has branched out from its indie heartland to become a bona fide mainstream hit. Back in 2018, Rachel Weisz wore a floor-length, deepest aubergine version to the Baftas, Margot Robbie wore the same in crimson to a wedding in Australia and Jennifer Aniston chose an identical frock for a Jimmy Kimmel appearance. Last year, Kate Moss appeared in a Vampire’s Wife campaign modelling a shorter version, the Mayhem, while Princess Beatrice wore the Falconetti to Ellie Goulding’s wedding. This dress has crossed every ide: from London to LA, from music to fashion, and from alternative to establishment.The Vampire’s Wife herself is the designer. The ex-model Susie Cave, 53, still has the milkmaid skin and Beetlejuice hair that made her a legendary beauty to whom Prince used to send red roses whenever he was in London. She launched her fashion label in 2014 with a name referencing her husband, the musician Nick Cave. Florence Welch, a devoted fan, has described the signature dress as “making you look like you are practising witchcraft in a very romantic cult”. The fabric is grand – corded dark velvet, or metallic silk chiffon in sweetie-wrapper bright – and the neckline is high and modest. The torso is body-skimming – but not tight – and ends in a seam positioned just above the natural waist. This simple shape is set off by narrow sleeves set on a posture-enhancing high armhole that flounce at the shoulder and waist. The skirt is softly gathered. The classic hemline is below the knee, although there is a short option beloved by Alexa Chung.The Vampire’s Wife phenomenon is remarkable for two reasons. First, famous women do not on the whole want to be seen in the same dress as everyone else, which means it takes a lot for a dress to overthrow the desire to look unique. Second, this dress is not an obvious choice. It is poetry, not pop. The elite few dresses that have enjoyed this degree of success have tended to be beloved for their figure-flattering properties. Mouret’s Galaxy dress, with its internal “power mesh” lining, was a double whammy of internal structure to suction and hold, with external styling that flattered (that elongating back zip) and added an air of sophistication (those origami-like folds at the neckline). Stella McCartney’s Octavia dress, which was everywhere in 2011 – Liv Tyler wore it, and Kate Winslet had it in two different colourways – used optical-illusion panels that functioned as a kind of hourglass-shaped filter over the body.The Vampire’s Wife is different. The shape modestly covers the upper arms and thighs, but the silhouette is cut to work best on a narrow torso and flat stomach. (It is forgiving of age, however, because it covers a lot of skin.) This dress takes the wholesome, milk-fed aesthetic of the prairie dress – and its ubiquitous high-street offshoot, the midi-length ditsy floral dress that has a ruffle at the hem and is probably being worn by someone in your office or railway carriage right now, probably with flat white trainers or ankle boots – and gives it a cheekboned, hungry kind of glamour. Wearing a Vampire’s Wife dress is an elevated kind of a power move: not only are you showing (to those who know) that you have the body to look good in this dress, you are also signalling that you are sufficiently sophisticated in your thinking and messaging to be low-key about showing off.The story of the Vampire’s Wife label is an emotional one. The label launched in 2014 with a broad-based bohemian aesthetic that took in pastel-toned full skirts, silk blouses, cashmere cardigans and Liberty-print tailoring. Then in July 2015, Susie and Nick’s 15-year-old son, Arthur, fell to his death in a tragic accident close to the Brighton family home, and any thoughts of fashion disappeared from Susie’s universe. But three months later, prompted by friends trying to distract her from her grief on the pretext of needing dresses made, she found her way back to her design studio. “To be honest, work is what has saved me,” she told Vogue in 2017. It was during this highly charged time that she narrowed focus, distilling the aesthetic to its essence and hitting on the very particular silhouette with which it has become synonymous. This is a party dress that has an air of melancholy. It is a Disney princess dress for goths, a dancefloor dress for the era of Billie Eilish. It speaks not just of fashion sophistication, but of emotional sophistication.This is a dress that speaks volumes. It is pretty, but it is slightly perplexing. And it is set to be everywhere in 2020: the most recent sighting was on Jodie Comer, while filming Killing Eve season three. The Duchess of Cambridge and Villanelle is about as strong a ticket as it gets. A dress that can unite those two is nothing short of magic. This spring, the Vampire’s Wife will have its moment in the sun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c3712de1a03ca0b3da6e24b0c51561c96f657f/184_531_2256_1353/2256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77fc3231acded90398dc5c678b15ccd","title":"the seventh seal to the exorcist max von sydow a life in pictures","story":"Swedish actor Max von Sydow has died at the age of 90.

They’ve even inspired poetry, of a sort: “Boxty on the griddle, boxty in the pan if you can’t make boxty, you’ll never get a man” – though, frankly, I wouldn’t be in rush to share mine with anyone, let alone someone too lazy to make their own.As with many traditional recipes from these islands, from Irish stew to cullen skink, boxty should be made with floury, sometimes known as mealy, potatoes – the sort that explode into billowing clouds of mash, rather than melt obediently into silky-smooth pommes puree. Waxy potatoes retain their shape and their texture too well, and turn this into something more like a rösti starchier kinds give a lighter, fluffier result.Kerrs pink and golden wonder are ideal, though the more widely available Roosters will also work well, and even all-rounders such as maris piper, desiree and king edward will be fine just avoid anything sold as a salad potato.Darina Allen, who in her book Irish Traditional Cooking includes a recipe given to her by one Granny Toye of Clones, Co. Monaghan, which instructs readers to squeeze the water out of the potatoes before use, and let it sit for 20 minutes until the starch sinks to the bottom. This can then be stirred back into the dry potatoes as a binder, and the liquid discarded, making her boxty the crispest of them all.(The much-loved domestic science textbook All in the Cooking, first published in 1946, calls for cooked potatoes alone, though it is labelled as “potato cakes” rather than boxty specifically. Nevetheless, I give it a try, and can confirm that fried potato is delicious in all forms, especially when a lot of butter is also involved.)Cooked potato gives the boxty a smoother, softer texture, helping to glue the strands together so you need less flour. That said, it does rely on having some to hand – a good thing if there’s a box of leftover mash reproaching you from the fridge (Skehan observes you can also use leftover colcannon, or presumably champ), but you can make very nice boxty without, too.Toyes’ recipe is the only one not to involve any extra fat, apart from that in which the boxty are cooked. All in the Cooking adds melted butter, or margarine Henry uses tangy buttermilk, and Rachel Allen and McKenna eggs. The latter also loosens her batter with milk the former single cream, explaining: “This is my husband Isaac’s take on boxty – he uses cream and not too much flour so they’re good and rich”.They are indeed – in fact, both Rachel Allen and McKenna’s recipes are almost halfway to Spanish omelettes: pieces of potato suspended in a kind of custard, and lovely they are, too. I’m taken by the simple approach of Granny Toyes, however fewer ingredients make for an intensely potatoey flavour. Call me decadent, but I can’t resist adding a splash of Henry’s buttermilk – the creamy acidity works so well with potatoes, though if you don’t have it, don’t worry.Toyes uses a bare handful of flour – just enough to stick the potato strands together – while Luard’s flour-heavy formula produces something more like a true bread (a good way to stretch potatoes a little further, if necessary).McKenna and Henry both add raising agents, but with so little flour in my recipe, I don’t think that will make much difference.Luard is the only one to bake her boxty, producing a pleasingly chewy, moist flat loaf with a distinct potato flavour. Everyone else fries them on a griddle butter is better than oil for flavour, though good lard or dripping would also be delicious if such things happen to be available.Wash the potatoes, coarsely grate them into a clean tea towel or muslin, then wring out as much liquid as possible into a bowl (a glass one will make life easier). Leave this to sit undisturbed for about 20 minutes, and in the meantime spread out the potatoes to dry.Carefully pour off the liquid from the bowl, retaining the white, starchy powder that’s collected on the bottom, then add the potatoes, salt and buttermilk to the bowl. Stir in enough flour that the potatoes stick together in loose clumps (you may not need it all).Heat the butter in a heavy-based frying pan about 20cm in diameter over a medium heat. When foaming, add the potato mixture and pat it down to fill the pan. Turn the heat down low and cook for about 15 minutes.Gently loosen the edges of the boxty, flip it on to a plate or board, then slide it back into the pan cooked side up, adding a little more butter first if the pan looks dry. Cook for another 15 minutes, until golden on both sides. Cut into quarters to serve.• Boxty, potato farls or tattie scones: what’s your favourite sort of potato bread, and how do you like to eat it?

It may well be the last game any fans go to, in fact. Valencia v Atalanta was played behind closed doors. Sevilla v Roma will be played without fans, as will Getafe v Internazionale and so, it was confirmed, will Barcelona against Napoli. La Liga’s announcement was soon followed by the Spanish Football Federation closing games in the third and fourth tiers. Postponements may well be next – a demand made by the players’ union. Schools, gyms and children’s football clubs have closed, too.All over European football measures were introduced and Pep Guardiola suggested it is inevitable that the Premier League will end up doing the same.

Everyone in Spain witnessed Barcelona endure what Jorge Valdano called stage fright last season. “We saw Liverpool lose 3-0 at Barcelona last year and turn it around so we know this result means nothing,” Stefan Savic said after the first leg. “We still have Anfield and we know it’s very difficult.” Atlético’s first‑leg win was unexpected their getting through would be less so now, although this weekend Koke said he “wished” he was at Liverpool’s level and insisted their recent results “won’t influence” this game.None of Liverpool’s results since then would see Jürgen Klopp’s side through, while every result Atlético have had would allow them to progress, even if they have not always convinced: a 3-1 win against Villarreal, 1-1 at bottom-placed Eyol and 2-2 with Sevilla. At the end of that game players gathered at the south end. “The Champions League is my obsession,” supporters sang. It has hurt them before but there is hope now.In theory, if there is any side built to hold a 1-0 lead, it is Atlético. This is the team that Kieran Trippier, fit again having missed the first leg, says he joined partly to learn how to defend – “the perfect club”. At the same stage last season they lost a 2-0 first‑leg win against Juventus, although Koke says: “Hopefully that will serve as a lesson.” In Madrid Liverpool did not manage a shot on target asked what he expects this time, Klopp said “more shots on target”. And perhaps the lesson is that it is not enough to defend.If Atlético do score, everything changes but they have fewer than half as many league goals as Barcelona. Álvaro Morata has scored only twice in 2020 – both penalties – and did not train on Monday. Diego Costa, who played 13 minutes in the first leg and is still not fully fit after an operation on vertebrae in his neck, has only two goals all season. João Félix, missing in the first leg, has returned. A €126m summer signing, he scored against Sevilla on Saturday and is their most creative talent although he is an uneasy fit in an Atlético team still seeking the identity that was momentarily recovered in the first leg, leaving them in a strong position for Anfield.Against Liverpool the old Atlético were revived now they must resist. Diego Simeone has always talked about going partido a partido, treating every game as if it was their last. At Anfield they will try to prevent this being their final game in Europe this year but there is nothing they can do to stop it being the last they play in front of their fans for some time to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54bb068e983d59911ac4bf471513e360fcf109b1/805_452_3243_1946/master/3243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a00900d1c512819a1ed91bd2e6fa77a2","title":"farewell champions league campaign spurs leipzig","story":"Only 10 months after Tottenham reached the European Cup final they hit the buffers in Leipzig – it looks like a long way backSo farewell then, Tottenham. Who knows when our paths will cross again? A fixture they embarked upon with a puncher’s chance and plenty of underdog spirit ended merely in crippling defeat and more questions. A broken team that under the joyless stewardship of José Mourinho has been broken still further, they looked here exactly what they are: the eighth‑best team in the Premier League, exhausted and error-prone, bad in defence and bad in attack, with no discernible long-term strategy and no identifiable short-term plan.Ten months ago Tottenham rocked up in Amsterdam and sprinkled miracles all over the Ajax turf. That seems a long time ago now. And as the second half began to tick away, one could almost feel those memories draining away with Spurs’ hope. Occasionally Érik Lamela or Lucas Moura would shrug off his Leipzig marker and find himself with space to run. But without a functional attacking system to support them, to provide decoys or passing options, running was all they could do: into an inevitable dead‑end of white shirts and white noise.And so perhaps it is time to bid farewell not just to a Champions League campaign but also to a team, an era, an idea. Christian Eriksen, Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose have gone and not been adequately replaced. Hugo Lloris and Jan Vertonghen are in sharp decline. Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Dele Alli, Toby Alderweireld, Eric Dier, all either injured or stagnant. Meanwhile the manager who made them all sing is now the most coveted unemployed coach in the sport. These are the sorts of losses that only the very elite clubs can weather for long. And at present Tottenham are nobody’s idea of that. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200309-45672-gnl.fw.20200309.sj.fw0309.mp3 However, departures and absences go only part of the way to explaining why so many of Tottenham’s remaining players have gone into such sharp decline. Perhaps there are physical factors at play, the immense workload these players have shouldered over the years: a thin, undernourished squad competing at maximum intensity in four competitions. Perhaps this is why Tottenham’s ravenous high-pressing game began to collapse under Mauricio Pochettino and has now gone into full-blown retreat under Mourinho.And yet here, at least in parts, it made a remarkable comeback. In stark contrast to some of their recent displays against top opposition, Tottenham raced out of the blocks: meeting Leipzig high up the pitch, snapping into their tackles, hunting as a pack. The game was open, the passing vertical and direct and agreeably impatient. Briefly, fleetingly, it felt as if Mourinho had finally decided to throw off the handbrake. Everything, in fact, was going to plan with the exception of two minor inconveniences. First, they had not created anything remotely resembling a decent chance. Secondly, they were 2-0 down inside 21 minutes.Marcel Sabitzer’s two-goal blitz perfectly illustrated the reliable midfield goal threat that Tottenham have been so lacking. Remarkably no Tottenham midfielder has scored in the Premier League or Champions League since Moussa Sissoko in December. This is a failure not just of iniduals but also of tactics: goalscoring midfielders are a measure of territorial dominance, of playing the game in the opposition half and creating chances in dangerous areas. But if the defence is sitting deep and the attack consists of sporadic breakaways and forlorn long balls, then the midfield is essentially a factotum: a means of shovelling the ball somewhere else, before settling in for the next wave of defensive pressure.Late in the game Mourinho summoned his assistant João Sacramento to his side and simply shrugged at him, like a customer returning a defective phone to a retailer. Look, João. It doesn’t work. I’ve tried all the buttons. I’ve tried playing 5‑4‑1 at home. I’ve tried throwing my club’s record signing under the bus on live television. Now I’ve tried to gegenpress one of the best teams in Europe with a knackered team and a bare minimum of preparation. It’s a dud.In a way Tottenham’s current travails merely underline what a stunning job Pochettino did for those few magical seasons. His main triumph was not as a tactician or a trainer but as an evangelist. With the help of a talented staff, an imaginative physical regime and the power of dreams, he made players better by convincing them there were no ceilings on their talent. He built a palace and, even if it was beginning to crumble by the time he left, there were surely alternatives to burning the thing down and starting again.Where now from here? Those fatal summers of under-investment will take more than one window to address, especially with a heavy stadium debt to service. The bruised egos and shattered confidence may take longer still. Tottenham need new players but they also need new hope. They need to believe that the qualities that brought them so close to the summit of the game can be rediscovered. Farewell then, Tottenham. It might be a while."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb412a9f68d5f0aa1be6638139d645adcc8cb0f/0_0_1574_944/master/1574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89b69f741bd79aeaa35c18b18da87aa6","title":"on a mission to heal the man with a plan to transform burundi","story":"With an election looming, Dieudonné Nahimana shares his vision for unity in a country scarred by ethnic violenceWhen civil war erupted in Burundi in 1993, like many children, the teenage Dieudonné Nahimana fled to the capital, Bujumbura, and ended up destitute.He became the de facto leader of a group of 40 street children, surviving in the shelter of abandoned buildings. It was an experience that drove his ambition higher, sowing the seeds for a nation-building project and his decision to run for president.Burundi goes to the polls on 20 May and Nahimana, standing as an independent, has a manifesto of unity.“In our country political parties have developed out of ethnic isions,” he says. “But the people helping my campaign come from all ethnic groups. Together, we are showing it’s time to value life in Burundi.”Burundi was granted independence from colonial Belgian rule.\u0026nbspThe assassination of Hutu prime minister\u0026nbspPierre Ngendandumwe\u0026nbspset in motion a\u0026nbspseries of assassinations, revolts, coups and\u0026nbspregional instability\u0026nbspthat ended with Burundi established as a republic and one-party state.\u0026nbspA Hutu rebellion is brutally crushed leaving 200,000 to 300,000 dead.\u0026nbsp150,000 people die in unrest after a military coup.Burundi\u0027s civil war erupts after the assassination of Hutu leader Melchior Ndadaye. Years of violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi army claim 300,000 civilian lives.\u0026nbspMost of the warring factions sign the peace deal iding key government and military posts between Hutu and Tutsi.\u0026nbspPierre Nkurunziza, a former Hutu rebel leader, is elected president.In May Nkurunziza was anointed as eternal supreme guide by the ruling party. But by June he announced that he would not seek another term and step down when his current term ends in 2020.Too often life has seemed to hold low worth in Burundi, whose history has been marked by occupation, civil war and intermittent violence between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis. Last month more than 6,000 bodies were found in six mass graves in Karusi province, the largest discovery since the government began excavations in January in a nationwide programme intended to help the east African country come to terms with its past.Nahimana lost his father and 18 relatives in the civil war and genocide which left 300,000 people dead. He believes ethnic disputes can finally be set aside in the election for a leader to replace President Pierre Nkurunziza, who has held office since the conflict ended in 2005.“This time the elections are going to focus on development and stability of the country, not on fixing the same issues that have been around for a long time,” Nahimana says. “We always knew this election would be the time for a new generation who want something other than the cycle of retribution. For nearly 20 years we’ve been training young people for decision-making positions and we knew they would be ready.”More than 6,000 young people have come through his New Generation leadership programme. They work as government advisers, bank managers, church leaders and in other influential positions, all ready to support his campaign and government, says Nahimana, whose family share his home with approximately 80 former street children.He believes Burundi is ripe for transformation, especially as the 1994 peace accord process of balancing ethnic groups in the army – intended to prevent Hutu rebellions against Tutsi leadership – has now been completed.Yet political violence has persisted in 2015 protesters clashed with police over Nkurunziza’s announcement that he would prolong his presidency and tensions erupted again before a referendum on allowing his third term. About 400,000 people have fled the country and hundreds have been killed. The UN, which has accused the government and its supporters of crimes against humanity, has warned of serious human rights violations.“We are not trying to be the next government in the same way. The government of Burundi has existed in the same way since the 1960s – militarily-led to manage crises – with almost all of the budget and focus on fixing these crises.”If he wins: “The number one priority for us will be to create an environment for peace and healing, because Burundians have been wounded by what happened in the past.“When you live in an environment where you do not know if you will be alive the next day, or if civil war will erupt in five or 10 years, you cannot plan for the future.”He claims he would tackle rampant corruption and remove barriers to young people’s involvement in managing the country – and it would rapidly develop agriculture, he says, pointing to Rwanda as an example of a country with a similar size population and history whose successful development shows what can be done. “In 1996 they were far behind Burundi but they developed quickly using just the resources they had.”As the national Truth and Reconciliation Commission has worked to repair rifts, the government has recognised Nahimana’s “healing memories” project, bringing together the genocide’s young victims and perpetrators. “We raised them to live as one community without considering where they came from.”“Because we are known for our peace and reconciliation work, the media does not attack us,” he says, adding that while there can be no guarantee elections will be free and fair, so far his campaign has observed the electoral commission is doing its job. But protection of the human rights of all Burundians would be an immediate priority – with support from the international community – and there would be an early discussion on rejoining the International Criminal Court, which, in 2017, Burundi became the first country in the world to leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cd084f5c00b2acc6041e79fe275af1d1ea178c7/0_460_6420_3852/master/6420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc7520671501ec11402567c0d90695f2","title":"over 100000 have fled nicaragua since brutal 2018 crackdown says un","story":"Exodus expected to continue from Central American country, amid fears of repeat of state and police repressionMore than 100,000 people have fled persecution in Nicaragua, with numbers set to rise, two years after the country was plunged into social and economic crisis, the UN’s refugee agency warned.Even after a violent crackdown against nationwide anti-government protests in April 2018 had subsided, Nicaraguan students, human rights defenders, journalists and farmers have continued to seek asylum abroad at the rate of 4,000 a month.“With no resolution to the internal crisis in sight, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, expects these numbers to grow,” said Shabia Mantoo, UNHCR spokesperson, in Geneva on Tuesday.Brutal repression by the national police and armed pro-government groups in 2018, left 300 people dead, 2,000 injured and hundreds of people arbitrarily detained and prosecuted.The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IAHCR) documented 777 arrests. Many of those detained were subjected to torture, electric shocks, asphyxiation and rape in prison.Costa Rica, Nicaragua’s neighbour, has received the majority of refugees and asylum-seekers, taking in two-thirds, or 77,000 people. A further 8,000 have fled to Panama and 9,000 have gone to Europe while Mexico is sheltering 3,600 Nicaraguans. In all, 103,600 are seeking refuge globally.The UN has helped Costa Rica to streamline its protocols to speed up refugee status and protection for Nicaraguans, Mantoo said, as well as to allow 6,000 of the most vulnerable people to access health services.Last week, the Committee to Protect Journalists called for an investigation into attacks on reporters covering the funeral of Ernesto Cardenal, a poet and priest, in Managua, Nicaragua’s capital. Local news outlets reported that the attackers wore red and black bandanas, the colours of president Daniel Ortega’s Sandinista ruling party.Cardenal had once supported the Sandinista revolution before distancing himself from it and becoming one of Ortega’s most public critics.Ivan Briscoe, the Latin American director of the International Crisis Group, an NGO aimed at resolving conflict, said levels of violence from the state and paramilitary police in Nicaragua has declined since the uprising in April 2018. However, the level of exodus from Nicaragua to Costa Rica “has not been seen at that speed or level” since the war, he said.“What we are seeing is a quiet stifling of opposition,” said Briscoe. “We have seen a steady decline in the number of political prisoners, there are something like 60 political prisoners left, compared to hundreds last year. But most of them are under house arrest, which means their cases are still active and if the government wanted to crack down on them, they could.”The UN human rights council has condemned abuses and has urged Ortega’s administration to resume co-operation with human rights bodies and negotiations with the opposition.In November last year, police arrested 16 anti-government protesters, accusing them of carrying out terrorists attacks, amid a protest by mothers on hunger strike in a church in the city of Masaya.Thirteen of those arrested were reported to be social leaders, trying to bring water to the mothers. The hunger strikers, demanding freedom for their children who they believe to be political prisoners, had locked themselves inside the church, in a protest seen as emblematic of similar demonstrations across the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf43c44268a193fabddabd6d905a483a80dbd917/0_0_9000_5400/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4514c0887b199e67b6156cc4ce7d19","title":"looking for love wash your hands first say dating apps","story":"How dating apps are adapting to love in the time of coronavirusDating apps are adapting to love in the time of coronavirus, warning their users of the elevated risks of going on dates while trying to ensure they do not switch off entirely when the time comes to self-isolate.OKCupid, which prides itself on its data-led approach to dating, asking users to fill in detailed questionnaires and matching them with others who give similar answers, has sent a push alert to every user asking them an additional question: “Does coronavirus affect your dating life?”Other dating apps have taken a softer approach, at least for the time being.

Meghan Remy talks booze, abuse and why she’s feeling mad as hellWhat is the most hurtful thing anyone’s ever said to you?“I don’t know what’s wrong with me that I make children like this.”“I don’t want you.”It’s not me asking the various musicians of US Girls about their traumas, but their frontwoman Meghan Remy, the creative core of perhaps the greatest band working in North America today. US Girls are as funkily, glamorously fraught as Roxy Music, slinking past any box you try to make for them. Remy has layered her bandmates’ answers over each other in a sonic collage between the songs on US Girls’ new album Heavy Light other collages include the advice they’d give their teenage selves, and the colour of their childhood bedrooms. “My husband says I have a mania for the truth,” she says. “Along with a mania for vulnerability.”Chatting in an office room at the , Remy is all eyes: she widens them to anime proportions for those moments of truth. Her previous album, In a Poem Unlimited from 2018, was a critically raved-about series of obsessively crafted studio pop songs Heavy Light, her eighth, was instead recorded live, because “life is messy”.Remy was raised in Chicago’s suburbs and now lives in Toronto after a spell in Portland. Her first album was in 2008 as a one-woman band. Now, 20 musicians appear on Heavy Light, including E Street Band saxophonist Jake Clemons: “The minute he starts playing, it’s the sound that you know from American music: it’s a breath thing, a blood thing, you can’t even learn it,” she says. Such a big band isn’t conducive to making money, though. She sketches out tour arrangements as “eight or nine people in three hotel rooms, sleeping in beds with each other for months at a time. We’re doing it because we want to do it, and have to, and believe in it.”Her lyrics encompass abused women, global heating, political revolution. The Quiver to the Bomb casts the climate crisis as Mother Nature inventing humanity out of loneliness, then “kicking us off her land”. Remy says, “it’s going to get really interesting” when our social orders break down as a result, when “you can’t pay attention to them any more because your survival is so immediate. As a white western person, I’ve never been in a war zone. So we’ll see what that’s like.”The single 4 American Dollars is a socialist anthem about the evils of accumulated wealth (“numbers on a screen mean nothing to me  We’re on the same boat, just different seats”), sounding like a 60s girl group anxiously entering the disco era. “You can’t take money with you,” Remy says. “But people want money, because it covers up all the stuff that should actually be your job, which is feeling, being curious, trying to know yourself, trying to know others.”This is Remy’s chief project. “It’s that cliche: if you can’t love yourself, you can’t love someone else. I’ve been in a relationship for 10 years now and I’ve found that is the case. The other person starts acting like a mirror for you and it’s so revealing.” What has she seen? “I don’t have an off switch when it comes to drinking – I just keep going. Because the way my brain is wired, it wants that, and my body’s not going to be the one to reveal it to me. Also, I have always had an inner monologue that’s always really negative about myself, and living intimate with someone means it starts coming out. It’s like a tic, I’m so hard on myself. And when someone who loves you is like, ‘Give yourself a break!’ … there’s nothing more powerful than someone feeling pain for you. It’s really healing.”This relentless scrutiny of herself and others has left her with an almost supernatural-sounding ability to sniff out repressed feelings. “When I know that something doesn’t sit right, I feel it physically,” she says. “My stomach starts hurting and I know there’s something more there. Some things happened to me when I was a kid that broke that part of my brain, or implanted a bullshit detector. I have these really fine-tuned antenna, constantly picking things up because I’m trying to survive.”There is a long pause. “This is always the part in so many interviews where it’s like: do I want to go there or not? I’ve been dancing around it in my work for ever.” Her songs are full of lines like “we can never know the hands we’re in, until we feel them grip”, from MAH, which stands for Mad As Hell. “Do I want to be that vulnerable and tell someone exactly what happened? I feel everyone knows what happened.” It was an abuse situation? “Mm-hmm, yeah.” A physical one? “Mm-hmm. So when that happens to you, and you decide to acknowledge it for yourself, it’s a paradigm shift. I can’t look at anything else.”And it left you with a bullshit detector. “Empathy as well. There was a period, and it can still happen, when I was acting real squirrelly. There were probably people around me like, ‘What is up with her? She’s crazy.’ If they’d only known what was going on with me, maybe they’d have empathy. I know now what you can do to yourself when you’re deceiving yourself, or you’re trying to repress something, or the narrative you’re supposed to live by can’t land in your body and plant, because your body’s telling you it’s not accurate.” She says that now when she meets someone giving her attitude, “I can say: this probably has nothing to do with me, it’s something in their life and I should be kind to them.”Today’s culture tends towards resisting trauma with “safe spaces”, but Remy is devoted to facing hers head-on, partly inspired by the writer and activist Sarah Schulman’s book Conflict Is Not Abuse. “We’re living in that cancel culture of, ‘No, I don’t want to talk about that’,” she says. “But if you’re feeling vulnerable, it usually means something important, something that you should go into. If something’s triggering you to feel bad, if you ignore it, you’re losing the colour in your life.” First getting on stage to perform was about “feeling the fear that I felt in abuse situations, that is like: this is dangerous. It’s like, you never feel as good as after you’ve been sick, because you understand then how terrible you felt. So I don’t have a fear of that vulnerability any more.”She gives me an example of someone else who decided not to hide. The band played Coachella festival in the Californian desert and were invited to a marijuana-themed event. “We’re not crazy weed heads but it was like, whatever, it’s free, there’s going to be food, let’s go. We show up at this McMansion and there’s all this free weed stuff. And out comes this woman, Susan, who looks like your typical white mom lady. She said she was once high up in the Mormon church, a racist, terrified of drugs. She had some sort of injury, was at her wits’ end, tried weed, and her life changed. All that scaffolding crumbled. And now she’s best friends with Sean Paul.” The lesson being: “If she doth protest too much, that means go there. You have these white male Republican dudes who are so homophobic, you’re like: huh, I think you need to kiss a man right away. It’s going to be really good for you.”She’s still mad as hell, though. She doesn’t vote, reasoning: “I cannot name one politician who is not ill.” She rails against the military-industrial complex, the Catholic church, luxury goods, how matriarchy props up patriarchy, how history is taught in American schools, and smartphones (she deliberately threw hers in a pool last year). Against capital, ultimately. “You’re working so much at your job, and when you’re not working, you’re supposed to have the energy to dissect the system? No, that’s why you want to watch Netflix – you need a fucking break. That’s why they invented these time-suck leisure things, so you have no energy and no time to question the thing that you’re stuck in.” And yet, “the types of conversations are definitely shifting. In France, talking with people there about the movement to change the language to be more inclusive so everything’s not gendered. Whoa, we’re just having wine at some loud bar talking about this – I think that’s incredible.” There will always be music, too – “one of my gods, that thing that makes life psychedelic and special”.More and more of us are having that scary, emancipating and near-giddy moment where we’re certain things are very bad indeed, and Remy is the soundtrack to that. “I’m not afraid of looking like a fool,” she says. “I’m not afraid of exposing myself, or being vulnerable, or being too earnest. Time’s up, time is so up.”• Heavy Light is out now.

She has lived there for 52 years but says she could face losing the property in seven days because of a row over what she calls “inflated” service charges.She has launched a GoFundMe page to raise £10,000 using the hashtag #GetUpStandUpforEsther.A possession hearing is scheduled for 18 March. On her fundraising page, Anderson says: “Every night for the past month, I have gone to bed in tears, anxious, in a state of disbelief. It has been so upsetting and nerve-wracking … I can barely sleep.”She was being prosecuted by the property management company TPS Estates, whose director, Nigel Cross, confirmed the hearing date and said: “As it is in effect going to court, we are unable to comment any further. It is in the hands of the legal processes.”It is understood that Anderson and Marley’s relationship lasted for about two years during the early 1970s, during which he spent time living at the flat.In 1972, when he was yet to fully establish himself as an artist outside his native Jamaica, Marley signed a record deal in London and embarked on a UK tour. During this period he is said to have led a nomadic existence, spending time at a number of places in the capital.According to Anderson’s current partner, Marley wrote I Shot the Sheriff – later covered by Eric Clapton and others – at the flat. He said Anderson was unable to raise the money to pay the charges, hence her decision to launch the fundraising campaign.According to the GoFundMe page, TPS Estates took over as the management agents responsible for the maintenance of the building in 2018.The page added that Anderson could lose her home if she did not pay the £8,500 being demanded for service charges.Anderson said: “I arrived in England in 1962, before Jamaica’s independence, as a young girl with nothing except my easel, paintbrushes, pageant dresses, a hunger to succeed and desire to put my native country on the map.”She said she did various jobs but “gave it all up to help Bob and the Wailers fulfil their destiny”.Anderson added: “I bought my flat in 1968 in Chelsea with the money I made. It has been my home ever since, and I have lived here for over 52 years.”Marley, who died in 1981 aged 36, would have turned 75 this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e668b0b7f2afdd4cb81795a44f6fde7fff6c5f2a/1348_571_2219_1331/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6498c8a6c8e7ef4fab1495a501f5991a","title":"hadley freeman search uncover family secrets podcast","story":"When Hadley Freeman found an old shoebox full of pictures and documents in the back of a wardrobe, it began a quest to find the real story of her family’s history and her grandmother’s escape to America from the Nazis.

We were looking forward to a joint committee in the UK on the 30th and we were also looking forward to the next stage of negotiations going ahead, but we have had indications today from Belgium there may be specific public health concerns.”It is not clear what the fresh concerns are, but Belgium has confirmed its first death from the virus.Last week two cases of the virus were confirmed by authorities in Brussels, one at the European Defence Agency and another at the Council of the European Union.Gove was answering questions at the first Brexit select committee hearing since the election.He defended the decision not to publish an impact assessment of the EU deal the government is pursuing despite issuing a 60-page assessment last week on the impact a deal with the US would have.As head of the exit operations groups and a member of the cabinet’s exit strategy group and member of the EU-UK joint committee, Gove is one of the most powerful government ministers in relation to Brexit.He was grilled by MPs over checks on goods to Northern Ireland and other key subjects on which the UK and the EU have clashed.He declined to answer questions about the checks mandated by the Northern Ireland protocol, saying: “That will be a matter for the joint committee.”His answer appears to underline what sources say is an agreement by both sides to “deal down the rhetoric” to allow negotiators to get on with the challenging task of getting an outline deal by the June deadline for the “stock taking” review of talks.The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also confirmed that the UK would produce a legal text of its negotiation position but reserved the right not to publish the text until it saw fit.The EU is also producing a legal text of its position with sources saying that when published the two papers will underline how far apart both sides are on key areas – fisheries, state aid and the level playing field and crime and justice.The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the government of misleading voters during the general election campaign by claiming there was an “oven-ready Brexit” when “in fact it was at the back of the frozen food section” and nowhere near completion.Kinnock put it to Gove that he knew it would be impossible for Britain to get a quota-free and tariff-free deal if it did not accept alignment with the EU on state aid and the level playing field.Gove hit back saying a frozen food version of Brexit would just take “longer for the microwave to ping” and in any case it was possible to get something like the “Marks and Spencer deal you get – a starter, main course and a pudding and you decide which ones you want to get but all for £9.99”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee8ff8d38526005112b56045ad1cf4d047c6f655/0_225_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98b034394f0bd5e48ea153d42cde9e27","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youItaly has locked down the entire country, with more than 60 million people told to “stay at home” avoid socialising.

At domestic level, the cost of membership to watch a county play all three formats across the 2020 season starts as low as £149 (Leicestershire) and peaks at £304 (Sussex). Understandably, non-Test match venues that do not receive regular income from the sale of international tickets but regularly sell out T20 Blast fixtures tend to be at the upper end of that scale.Warwickshire have gone a step further, with free entry for kids across all T20 Blast fixtures at Edgbaston. “It’s expensive to do things with kids these days in the leisure sector so we wanted to make sure we were standing out from the crowd,” says Alex Perkins, Warwickshire’s head of commercial. “We don’t want to just be chasing the pound when actually the lifetime value of a supporter – particularly a young one who is hopefully going to be a Bears fan for life and come to Test matches and all the other matches that we have here – is huge to us as a club. Not just in terms of monetary value, but in terms of growing our fanbase.”“When we tender for international matches that’s done on a five-year cycle,” explains Perkins. “And because as part of the cycle we have an Ashes fixture, where demand is so high, it allows us to then better manage price points in different years. Ultimately, major match income is the biggest source of revenue for many venues and it does put the pressure on, particularly for those who haven’t got a regular supply of fixtures each year. We’ve been lucky enough that we’ve got a really good supply. We have the biggest capacity outside of London so it’s really important for us that we capitalise on the last couple of years and become known as a sell-out venue regardless of the opposition. That’s definitely a consideration for us as well with pricing.”Trent Bridge also offers prices that, according to the CSA survey, would be accessible for the majority of cricket fans. Nottingham will host a Test against Pakistan and an ODI versus Ireland this summer, with 46 of the 56 adult price points across the two matches coming in at under £50.As you might expect, the landscape in London is a little different. There are three Tests in the capital this summer – two at Lord’s and one at The Oval – but you won’t be able to get your hands on an adult ticket for days one to three of any of those matches for under £50. Day four prices start at £40 at Lord’s and £45 at The Oval.In comparison to other major sporting events, these prices are not unreasonable. And with demand at an all-time high – Surrey recently sold more international tickets in a day (around 32,000) than they have ever done before, and that is without the draw of the Ashes this summer – tickets could be priced considerably higher and the capital’s cricket grounds would still sell out.However, if cricket is really serious about “growing the game” and making its star attractions accessible to new punters, it is concerning that so many existing fans find international ticket prices in London prohibitive. After the success of 2019, there will be no better opportunity to attract and seize hold of new fans and that means ensuring that the game at elite level isn’t restricted to elite customers.• This article appeared first in Wisden Cricket Monthly• Follow Wisden and Jo Harman on Twitter• Buy the next three issues of Wisden’s digital edition for £2.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4771016fd9b26159cdd919400e8237aa5de31a62/739_354_3982_2389/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72c5eceb2a24d16c861216a85651d556","title":"england cricketers fan interaction coronavirus sri lanka","story":"England players have been instructed not to sign autographs or pose for selfies with fans during their Test tour of Sri Lanka in an attempt to protect the squad from coronavirus.The England team have been on the island – which recorded its second confirmed case overnight – since last week and have stepped up precautions before the first Test in Galle next Thursday.Between 3,000-5,000 supporters, many of them retired, are due to fly to Sri Lanka and they have been warned the usual level of interaction they have come to expect with the players has been affected by medical advice.Joe Root’s side are typically happy to sign shirts and bats as well as appearing in photographs but have been instructed to keep their distance from those arriving from the United Kingdom. Interactions with the media have already been impacted, with a two-metre buffer zone implemented for any group interviews.A statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board said: “Due to the ongoing situation regarding the current coronavirus outbreak around the world, the England men’s Test team, currently touring Sri Lanka, kindly requests all supporters joining the tour to maintain good levels of hygiene as advised by the World Health Organisation and the NHS, to avoid possible infection and spreading.“The touring party is now taking positive steps to reduce the risk of its health by limiting public engagements for its players and management team. England players and staff have been asked to avoid any unnecessary public engagements, and temporarily avoid casual supporter interaction such as selfies or autographs.“While we acknowledge that this will be disappointing for some supporters, we stress that this a measure to protect the ongoing well-being of the England Test squad and is a decision which has not been taken lightly. Following the world health agency’s advice, and in order to protect the players and, in turn, the integrity and continuation of the Sri Lanka Test tour, the team has put in place several precautions, leading to a number of normal activities being cancelled for the foreseeable future.”Handshakes with squad members, officials and opposition players were already banned, with fist bumps the new preferred greeting.England are preparing for a first-class warmup fixture against a President’s XI on Thursday, when they are hoping to play a full-strength side in preparation for the series opener.There are a couple of question marks - with a late check due on the calf injury that kept Jack Leach out of the previous tour match and a three-way race between Sam Curran, Chris Woakes and Saqib Mahmood for one seam bowling spot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99155c6aa0018d4e14db9edea55a1fef0174587f/0_59_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57a32ec1b4810f681951d317eb700c4c","title":"cheltenham festival 2020 champion chase day tiger roll in action live","story":"The Big Breakaway is now getting into contention, with Getaway Fred drifting off the back now.

The Big Breakaway, thankfully for this MBMer, isn’t in the mix just yet.The Ballymore is off and running!Fears over coronavirus played their part as Tuesday’s crowds were down on 2019, but organisers expect the Festival to carry on, PA reports.With increased hygiene measures in place, the Festival began on Tuesday with more than 60,000 racegoers in attendance - down almost 7,000 on last year.“We had a fantastic first day here yesterday with seven brilliant races, which reminds us what the sport is really about,” said Ian Renton, a regional director for Jockey Club Racecourses.“All the measures we put in place were well used by racegoers, and we were topping up our hand sanitiser gel stations all day long. The attendance being down was not a surprise. The last fortnight, ticket sales have been very quiet.“We have been liaising with the Government throughout this their advice has been extremely helpful. We’ve been following that advice to the letter and we will continue to do so until the conclusion of the Festival.”Seven different riders won a race on day one - Barry Geraghty, David Bass, Rachael Blackmore, Nico de Boinville, Jamie Codd, Aidan Coleman and Brendan Powell - with no victories for the favourite, Paul Townend.One more winner for Geraghty would take him to 40 at the Festival. I reckon he’s still the best there is when it really matters, though De Boinville coped well with a difficult run through on Shishkin. Coleman earned just the third Festival win of his career, 11 years after the first, but may not have long to wait for the fourth, as Paisley Park will be here on Thursday. Townend will be desperate to get a Wednesday winner, having been beaten on four fancied runners on Tuesday, his first Festival outing as Willie Mullins’s main jockey. He is still favourite to end the week on top but market confidence is ebbing, particularly with Chacun Pour Soi out.Nicky Henderson 2Henry de Bromhead 2Gordon Elliott 1Kim Bailey 1David Bridgwater 1Nicky Henderson is once more the most successful trainer in Festival history, his 66 wins putting him one ahead of Willie Mullins. His prize money haul from landing the Champion Hurdle and the Supreme also puts him well clear in the race to be top trainer this season, as Paul Nicholls had no runners here on Tuesday. Henry de Bromhead has now had two winners at consecutive Festivals for the first time and his week could get better still. Gordon Elliott nicked a winner in the last, having gone close with Abacadabras and Galvin, and is now favourite to be top trainer of the week.Top trainer betting:11-8 Gordon Elliott13-8 Willie Mullins9-2 Nicky Henderson6-1 Henry de BromheadSomebody has decided Envoi Allen is basically past the post, as he was hammered from 5-4 to 4-6 for this race, during Tuesday’s action. Judging by the time of the price movements, the trigger was Abacadabras running so well in the Supreme, as Envoi Allen beat him in the Royal Bond in December.Darver Star, third that day, was also third in yesterday’s Champion Hurdle, so the form book is fully behind Envoi Allen, the Champion Bumper winner a year ago. But there are some useful rivals in the line-up, most obviously Sporting John, unbeaten in three over hurdles and impressive at Ascot last time, though this is a big step up in class.The Big Getaway, for the Mullins  Townend combination, hacked up in a Naas maiden hurdle, as he was fully entitled to do, and has plenty of potential. The Big Breakaway is similarly unexposed, though his being five and absent since December are sources of concern. Easywork chased home Asterion Forlonge in a Grade One last time, which is still solid form, although things went wrong for the winner here on Tuesday. Son Of Camas has had a wind operation since flopping in the Tolworth and 50-1 seems unfairly dismissive.The future of ITV’s racing coverage beyond the end of the year is still shrouded in uncertainty, but its coverage on the opening day of this year’s Festival was extremely popular with viewers, attracting the highest share of the available audience for at least 17 years.1.30 Ballymore Novice HurdleEnvoi Allen 4-62.10 RSA ChaseEasy Game (nb) 12-12.50 Coral CupTop Moon 20-13.30 Queen Mother Champion ChaseDefi Du Seuil 1-34.10 Cross-Country ChaseEasysland 4-14.50 Fred Winter Handicap HurdlePalladium (nap) 9-15.30 Champion BumperAppreciate It 2-1After a flying start for Britain, with four of the first seven winners, this would be close to a rout, with only Nicky Henderson preventing a clean sweep for raiders. It would be fun to have a French winner at the Festival again, unless of course you care deeply about Tiger Roll winning another cross-country. Chacun Pour Soi missing the Champion Chase is a blow for Paul Townend and Easy Game could beat him on Allaho in the RSA. I’ve still got two for Willie Mullins in this list, which would hardly be a surprise, even if Tuesday didn’t go to plan for the Carlow man. Joseph O’Brien hit the bar with Fakir but perhaps Top Moon can get him a winner.ITV will be covering the big races live today, amid ongoing uncertainty over the future of racing on the channel. Here’s Greg Wood’s story from Tuesday:The Tote’s new starting price guarantee – that Tote punters online and at the course will get paid at SP if the normal Tote win return will be lower – made its Festival debut on Tuesday and came into effect in the last four races, including the Champion Hurdle.Epatante would have paid out at £2.70 for the win pre-guarantee, but instead all her backers at the track got an extra 30p for every pound staked, reflecting her SP of 2-1. There was a bigger bonus in the next race, the Mares’ Hurdle, where Honeysuckle would have paid £2.90 against an SP of 9-4, while later on the card, punters got £5 and £13 about Imperial Aura and Ravenhill, rather than £4.70 and £12.70.“From our point of view, it was a successful first day,” Susannah Gill, the Tote’s director of communications and corporate affairs, said this morning. “The pool offered value early on, as well as Tote Guarantee kicking in later in the day to ensure customers don’t lose out with the Tote, which is exactly what it’s there for.“With Tote Guarantee in place we’re pleased with the increased attention and positive feedback from customers.” There has been no official line to suggest that the Festival won’t run until Friday as planned, but it does feel as though the shutters could be pulled down on sport around the country at any moment. In case the worst happens, Marina Hyde has an idea:From being seen as probably the best race of the Festival just 48 hours ago, this afternoon’s Queen Mother Champion Chase now looks likely to be the least competitive contest of the week, following the bitterly disappointing news that Willie Mullins’s Chacun Pour Soi has joined Altior on the sidelines. Chacun Pour Soi was found to be slightly lame this morning prior to the “trot-up” procedure in front of a vet from the British Horseracing Authority that all horses must go through to be passed fit to race. When a shoe was removed, vets found an abscess in one of the eight-year-old’s feet and he was immediately scratched from the race.Joe Chambers, racing manager to Rich Ricci, Chacun Pour Soi’s owner, said: “He’s just got a bit of pus in a foot. It’s a 24-hour thing. It’s disappointing, but what can you do?”Ricci’s horse was the 6-4 second-favourite for this afternoon’s race behind Defi Du Seuil, who is now a 4-11 chance. His sudden departure from the line-up is a major setback for Willie Mullins, his trainer, and Paul Townend, his rider, both still looking for their first win of the meeting.To coincide with the Festival and International Women’s Day, Great British Racing have launched their #JustJockeys campaign, promoting gender equality in racing.Rachael Blackmore and Flat race jockey Hollie Doyle are backing the campaign. “We compete against men every day and we’re equals on and off the track,” says Doyle. “#JustJockeys recognises that all jockeys have the same skills and are equally as driven ... if given the opportunity, women are just as good as men and our gender should not come into the equation.”Here’s Chris Cook on the news that Chacun Pour Soi will miss the Champion Chase, plus his tips for today’s other races.Having been the race we were all looking forward to, this is in danger of being a deflating experience. On top of Altior’s lameness, Chacun Pour Soi will also miss the race because of an abscess reported at 11am. That leaves just one of the ‘Big Three’, Defi Du Seuil, who is now going to be the shortest priced runner at this Festival, at around 1-3 as I type. His credentials are excellent, as a two-time Festival winner in the Triumph and the Marsh, and he has re-established himself as a two-miler this winter by beating Un De Sceaux in the Tingle Creek and the Clarence House. He would have been vulnerable against an on-song Chacun Pour Soi, who beat him comfortably last April, but now faces a straightforward task. If this small field leads to a steady pace, that will suit, as he has a wicked turn of foot. Dynamite Dollars ran well behind Altior on his return from a year’s absence last month and he might be dangerous if allowed to get loose on the front in this small field. Politologue, Sceau Royal and Bun Doran look like known quantities who should not be good enough.After Altior’s withdrawal yesterday, Chacun Pour Soi has been declared a non-runner for today’s feature race.

Greenkey, we’ll be in touch by email to arrange your prize. And if you don’t win today, don’t despair. We are running an identical competition on each day of the Festival.Two favourites beaten at odds-on made it a rewarding day for the bookmakers on the opening afternoon at the Festival, though the success of 3-1 favourite Epatante in the feature event sent at least some money in the opposite direction.Tuesday, though, was probably little more than a warmup for Wednesday’s exchanges in the betting ring. The two middle days of the meeting proved hugely rewarding for the backers last year, with a long run of winning favourites that left the bookies chasing their losses for a change (and cost racing around £5m in Levy income). This afternoon’s card certainly has the potential to be just as profitable for punters.It has a short-priced favourite at either end, headed up by Envoi Allen in the Ballymore Novice Hurdle. He has been seen as a banker for months, with other trainers arranging their running plans around where he was most likely to turn up, and the news on Sunday that Gordon Elliott had singled out the opener this afternoon was enough to send his price below even money.If Envoi Allen goes in, there are several warm favourites throughout the card for reinvestment of winnings, ahead of the Bumper at 5.30, when Willie Mullins’s Appreciate It is yet another short-priced market leader. Even the Cross Country, generally one of the least popular events at the meeting from a betting point of view, offers no refuge for the bookies, as dual National winner Tiger Roll, probably the most popular chaser in training, will be attempting to follow up last year’s victory.If the results start going the punters’ way, it is possible that there will be as many as four horses at around evens or shorter on today’s card, as Defi Du Seuil is only narrowly odds-against for the Champion Chase.This race, of course, is now a head-to-head after Altior’s departure from the line-up on Tuesday. The bookmakers seem fairly sure at this stage that Defi Du Seuil will set off as favourite, but having walked around the race a dozen times and prodded it in all manner of places, I still can’t see why Chacun Pour Soi is not joint-favourite at least.He is 6lb clear of Defi Du Seuil on Timeform ratings, beat his main rival soundly at Punchestown last year, should still be improving after just eight starts to date and stopped the clock in the sort of time that only an outstanding performer can manage at Leopardstown last time. Defi Du Seuil, it’s true, has the important advantage of proven form at the track, but even so.Still, it’s all about opinions and this one, along with many others, will be tested when the tapes go up – or rather, across – at 1.30pm GMT this afternoon. Chris Cook’s tips for the day are here, and all the news and views will appear here as they happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eea4dc350634eaf1807c60c6acd0bbe822bca3/0_249_4408_2645/master/4408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e88897b3eeb4dd44c16f434e800bd321","title":"are electric cars cheaper to maintain and four other common ev questions answered","story":"Motoring journalist Jess Shanahan tackles the questions often asked by drivers thinking of going electric – and finds out EVs are efficient to run, easy to charge, and cost-effectiveIf you’re currently in the market for a new car, chances are you’ll have considered, at least briefly, the possibility of going electric.While even five years ago, the thought of owning an electric vehicle (EV) was pretty radical, increased awareness of the climate crisis combined with ever-improving EV technologies – not to mention talk of cost savings – are resulting in more and more people making the switch.But if you still have some pressing questions and niggling doubts, you’re not alone. We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Sandi Toksvig stepped down in January after co-presenting the show for three years.Lucas said in a statement: “I’m chuffed to bits to be joining the most delicious show on television. I can’t wait to break bread with Noel, Prue and Paul and meet the brilliant bakers. And bearing in mind my love of cake, I’ve already ordered some much larger trousers in anticipation. See you in the tent!”Fielding said: “I love Matt. I love his warmth and his comedy and his big joyful smile. I think if we play our cards right we could become the next Chas and Morph.”Paul Hollywood described Lucas as a “fantastic addition to the team”, while his fellow Bake Off judge Prue Leith said: “The combination of Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding! Will we stop laughing and get any filming done?”The show was presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins from 2010 to 2016 when it was broadcast by the BBC. It moved to Channel 4 in a £75m deal after the corporation refused to pay the production company Love Productions £25m a year.The former Bake Off contestants Liam Charles and Nadiya Hussain and the comedian Jo Brand were among the names rumoured to be in contention to take over from Toksvig, who also presents the BBC quiz show QI.Ian Katz, Channel 4’s director of programmes, said: “We’re thrilled that one much-loved national institution is joining another. Matt has everything it takes to be a Great Bake Off presenter: he’s warm, hilarious and loves cake.”Bake Off remains a hugely popular franchise for Channel 4 despite viewing figures falling from a peak in 2015, when 14.5 million people watched the series finale won by Hussain. The last series, won by David Atherton, was plagued by criticism of its increasingly difficult challenges.Toksvig’s final presenting stint, on the spinoff Stand Up to Cancer series, is currently airing.Lucas first came to prominence on the comedy quiz show Shooting Stars and is best known as a co-creator and star of Little Britain alongside David Walliams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c974f0bdb035aba68f5fed74ea61f2e3e6ab3f4/0_267_1408_845/master/1408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d818b02b164e886eccdcf3ecc3410524","title":"closed borders and black weddings what the 1918 flu teaches us about coronavirus","story":"The influenza of 1918 killed up to 100 million people. What lessons does it offer for our current health crisis?Plagues – or, to use a more modern term, epidemics of infectious disease – pluck at our most primal fears. We have lived with them for at least 10,000 years, ever since our ancestors took up farming and built the first semi-permanent settlements. And they have always had the upper hand. They know us intimately, preying on our strengths – our sociability, our love of gossip – and turning them into weaknesses. They are always a step ahead, and once they are out, like the genie, we can’t get them back in. All we can do is limit the damage. So here we are again.Because epidemics are frightening, it is hardly surprising that people reach for the worst possible historic comparison. The 1918 influenza pandemic, which has been distilled in the public imagination to a single black-and-white image of bedridden US soldiers, has been hauled out of mothballs to do duty as a template of what we might expect from Covid-19. But is that global human catastrophe, which killed between 50 million and 100 million people – the vast majority in the developing world – and which was largely forgotten for most of the last century, the right comparison to make?It is important to note that the Covid-19 outbreak is not yet officially a pandemic – a global epidemic. Some have accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of doing semantic cartwheels to avoid naming it as one, given the rate at which the disease is spreading, but at the time of writing roughly half of the world’s countries remain Covid-19-free.Should we be comparing Covid-19 to flu at all? The viruses that cause the two diseases belong to different families. Sars-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus family, other members of which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China between 2002 and 2004, and of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which began in Saudi Arabia in 2012.The bottom line, then, is that Covid-19 will almost certainly not turn out to be as bad as the 1918 flu pandemic, but it could still be bad – perhaps on a par with the pandemics of 1957 or 1968. Until a vaccine becomes available – which isn’t likely for at least 18 months – containment is our only hope for slowing its spread.Where containment is concerned, historical comparisons can help, because the techniques don’t change. Quarantine, isolation, masks and handwashing are all time-honoured methods of keeping the sick and the healthy apart, and minimising disease transmission.One lesson governments took from 1918 is that mandatory public health measures tend to be counterproductive. Containment is much more effective if people choose to comply. But for that to happen, they need to be properly informed about the threat they face, and to trust the authorities to act in their collective interest. If either – or both – of these things is missing, containment works less than well. In 1918, most governments were caught unawares by the pandemic – because they had no disease surveillance system in place – and public information campaigns were risible.One of the reasons the 1918 flu came to be known as the “Spanish” flu was because Spain was neutral in the war and didn’t censor its press. Whereas the US, Britain and France – all of which had the flu before Spain – kept it out of the newspapers at first to avoid damaging morale. When they finally acknowledged it, the newspapers issued conflicting public health messages and repeated unfounded rumours – including one that German U-boats beaching in the US had deliberately sown the flu.Germ theory – according to which infectious diseases are caused by microscopic organisms – was also relatively new. Inevitably, people found it easy to revert to more mystical, and more fatalistic, explanations of what was happening. In the deeply pious Spanish city of Zamora, for example, the local bishop defied the health authorities by ordering a novena – evening prayers on nine consecutive days – in honour of Saint Rocco, the patron saint of plague and pestilence. This involved churchgoers lining up to kiss the saint’s relics, around the time that the outbreak peaked. Zamora went on to record the highest flu-related death rate of any city in Spain, and one of the highest in Europe.New York City, on the other hand, experienced one of the lowest death rates. The city’s inhabitants were used to public health interventions by 1918, since local authorities had orchestrated a 20-year campaign against tuberculosis. But some New Yorkers had other ideas: local papers reported on a “black wedding” in Mount Hebron cemetery, where two Jewish strangers were married in an ancient ritual to ward off plague. Meanwhile, in the business community, there was resistance to the health commissioner’s attempts to restrict attendance at places of entertainment. When Charlie Chaplin’s film Shoulder Arms was released in the autumn of 1918, Harold Edel, the manager of the Strand theatre – a cinema on Times Square – praised his customers for their impressive turnout. He died of flu a few weeks later.The world of 2020 is vastly different from 1918. Howard Phillips, a historian of the 1918 flu at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, observes “the relative silence of organised religion” during this outbreak, compared with the 1918 pandemic. Laura Jambrina, a teacher and resident of Zamora, notes that today the church authorities have been more vocal in their public health guidance than the secular, provincial ones – advising worshippers to wash their hands and not to sprinkle holy water. Religion has, nevertheless, played a part. The South Korean cluster of Covid-19 seems to have spread via churches, while pilgrims in Iran have posted videos of themselves defiantly licking the Fatima Masumeh shrine in the city of Qom.Many other things haven’t changed. There was a lot of fake news in 1918 and there’s a lot of fake news now – and in 2020, its volume and speed of transmission is unprecedented. Donald Trump’s grandfather died of the 1918 flu, yet Trump has been accused of misleading Americans over the Covid-19 outbreak through his tweets. Meanwhile, hashtags circulating on Italian social media – such as #FlorenceDoesntStop, #CultureAgainstFear – could partly explain the difficulty the Italian authorities are having in containing the outbreak. A prominent Italian politician, Nicola Zingaretti, announced last weekend that he had come down with Covid-19 after organising a party on the theme of #MilanDoesntStop. The Harold Edel of our day will hopefully make a speedy recovery.There have been horrifying reports of people drinking industrial alcohol or taking cocaine to ward off Covid-19. In 1918, too, people thought alcohol would protect them, and quacks cashed in on people’s desperation by packaging up ineffective and sometimes even toxic concoctions into “elixirs” for which they charged exorbitant prices. Some of the more vivid images of this epidemic also echo those of a century ago. The Brazilian medic and writer Pedro Nava described in 1918 how, in Rio de Janeiro, footballers played to empty stadiums. The same is happening today, only now people watch the matches on TV.Old habits also die hard many people are still kissing each other by way of greeting. “I have to bite my tongue every time I meet someone on the street with my baby girl,” says Jambrina. “Most people will immediately touch her cheeks or kiss her.” And we seem to have forgotten that closing borders against infectious disease doesn’t work. Many countries have done so, despite the WHO’s advice, but they are now discovering that the bug is already on the inside – and they have still got to deal with it.It’s a lesson we seem to have to learn again every time a new pandemic appears, and the kneejerk tendency to pull up the drawbridge shares xenophobic roots with another – that of blaming “the other”. In 1918, before the name “Spanish flu” caught on, Brazilians called it the German flu, while the Senegalese called it the Brazilian flu. The Poles called it the Bolshevik disease and the Danes thought it “came from the south”. Now they are blaming Chinese people.If there is one feature of the current epidemic for which we should applaud ourselves – besides the reports that skies are blue again over Chinese cities, since traffic has come to a standstill – it is that we have managed to avoid giving this outbreak a stigmatising name. The WHO guidelines of 2015 on how to name diseases can take a lot of credit for this. So this new plague is not the Chinese flu or the pangolin flu, it’s the rather more mundane Covid-19 – just one more epidemic in a long line of epidemics that have struck fear into our hearts, and that we can still rein in if we would just listen to our brains instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5695715e38c31d641f57a279d36537b99be929/0_360_4011_2407/master/4011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c68b97c24bb48a66f8dfb9f39b390f27","title":"coronavirus symptoms should i see doctor covid 19","story":"What is Covid-19, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and at what point should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work.

Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. 62,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/881be6ce5f15dec55f21f3bb577d2e51dfff81c9/50_52_1030_618/master/1030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4f27aa9362b94f820549e5153c2691e","title":"coronavirus wuhan doctor ai fen speaks out against authorities","story":"Ai Fen says in interview, which censors are trying to erase, how superiors reprimanded her for warning about outbreakA doctor in Wuhan has spoken out after seeing several of her colleagues die from the coronavirus, criticising hospital authorities for suppressing early warnings of the outbreak in an interview censors have been trying to erase from the internet.In an interview with the Chinese magazine, Renwu, or People, Ai Fen, director of the emergency at Wuhan Central hospital, said she was reprimanded after alerting her superiors and colleagues of a Sars-like virus seen in patients in December.Now that the virus has claimed more than 3,000 lives inside China, including four doctors at her hospital, one of which was the whistleblower ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, Ai has joined other critics risking their jobs, as well as detention, to speak out about conditions in Wuhan.“If I had known what was to happen, I would not have cared about the reprimand. I would have fucking talked about it to whoever, where ever I could,” she said in the interview.Since Tuesday, Ai’s interview has been posted and quickly deleted from Chinese social media sites. Renwu has removed the article and Ai could not be reached over the phone. Internet users have moved quickly to save the article, posting screenshots of it.New versions of the article, in attempts to evade censors, have proliferated, from one partly written in emojis to another done in morse code, as well as pinyin, the romanisation system for Mandarin.On 30 December, after seeing several patients with flu-like symptoms and resistant to usual treatment methods, Ai received the lab results of one case, which contained the word: “Sars coronavirus.” Ai, reading the report several times, says she broke out into a cold sweat.She circled the words Sars, took a photo and sent it to a former medical school classmate, now a doctor at another hospital in Wuhan. By that evening, the photo had spread throughout medical circles in Wuhan, where it was also shared by Li Wenliang, becoming the first piece of evidence of the outbreak.That night Ai said she received a message from her hospital saying information about this mysterious disease should not be arbitrarily released in order to avoid causing panic. Two days later, she told the magazine, she was summoned by the head of the hospital’s disciplinary inspection committee and reprimanded for “spreading rumours” and “harming stability”.The staff were forbidden from passing messages or images related to the virus, she said. All Ai could do was ask her staff to wear protective clothing and masks – even as hospital authorities told them not to. She told her department to wear protective jackets under their doctor coats.“We watched more and more patients come in as the radius of the spread of infection became larger,” she said, as they began to see patients with no connection to the seafood market, believed to be the source of the first cases.Meanwhile, Chinese officials were still insisting there was no reason to believe the virus was being passed between people. “I knew there must be human to human transmission,” Ai said.On 21 January, the day after Chinese officials finally confirmed there was human to human transmission of the virus, the number of sick residents coming to the emergency room had already reached 1,523 in a day – three times the normal volume.In the interview, Ai described moments that she will never forget: an elderly man staring blankly at a doctor giving him the death certificate of his 32-year-old son, or a father who was too sick to get out of the car outside of the hospital. By the time she walked to the car, he had died.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Once, when she arranged for the transfer of a man’s mother-in-law to in-patient care, the man took a moment to thank Ai. The mother-in-law died upon arrival. “I know it was only a few seconds but that ‘thank you’ weighs heavily on me. In the time it took to say this one sentence, could a life have been saved?”Over the last two months, Ai said she has also seen many of her colleagues fall sick and four die from the virus. One of those was Li Wenliang, whose death prompted an unprecedented wave of national anger and mourning.Early on during the outbreak, public security officials in Wuhan said eight people had been punished for “spreading rumours”.

Still, several friends have asked Ai if she was one of those whistleblowers.“I am not a whistleblower,” Ai told Renwu. “I am the one who provided the whistle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df279541d7cf5f8c579601d4ba918875396a5c9d/0_216_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92eec0cfc268891d794601009950a0c5","title":"dutch mall groningen netherlands forum urban hub","story":"The Forum complex in the Dutch city Groningen is trying to show that town centres don’t need to sell to surviveFour-year-old Joris Niekus hops excitedly in front of a wall-sized flatscreen as his dad loads up an interactive version of Roald Dahl’s BFG (known as GVR in Dutch).Seconds later, face beaming, his digitised silhouette is bopping across the screen together with Dahl’s gangly giant.It’s just one of many experiences on offer at a new downtown development in the Dutch city of Groningen that is seeking to reinvent urban hubs for the post-consumer age.The €101m, trapezoid Forum building is part library, part meeting space, part science museum and part recreational hangout – a 10-storey “multi-space” designed to resonate with citizens who know that shopping is not necessarily the answer. It’s a new-look department store that doesn’t actually sell very much.But with high streets feeling the pinch across the developed world, with shops shuttered and town centres wondering what they are for any more, the Groningen experiment is being closely watched.Nowhere is that truer than in the UK, where more than 16,000 retail stores closed last year at the cost of more than 143,000 jobs. The picture in the US is similar, with more than 9,300 shops going to the wall in 2019 as shoppers increasingly move online.It’s early days, but the Forum certainly feels like it is working. More than 700,000 people – three times the city’s total population – have visited the library since it opened late last year. So, what’s the big draw?There are books galore (92,000 in total), but they are for rent, not sale, distributed liberally across multiple mezzanine floors with a joyous disregard for Dewey decimal discipline. Geography on one floor, history on another, mathematics … somewhere, presumably.For the non-bookish, there’s plenty besides: a six-screen cinema, two exhibition halls, a couple of cafes, a museum (about comics, no less), a 250-seater auditorium, and a hip (but not overly hip) top-floor restaurant and bar. Oh, plus a rooftop “market square” with panoramic views over the whole of Groningen.“Every day when I pick him up from school, he asks to come to the Forum. He just finds it so much fun,” says Joris’s dad, Marcel, an archaeologist, who cuts his working day short every Tuesday to accommodate his son’s request.The comment is music to the ears of Dirk Nijdam, the Forum’s director, who readily admits that lending out books has never been his priority. Instead, what’s driven his thinking since he took on the project six years ago is the idea of creating a space where anyone and everyone can wander in, kick back and collectively feel at home.“If people walk in and say, ‘Wow, Groningen has got a new library’, then we’ll have failed,” he says. “If you want to come in and just hang out, you should feel just as welcome as if you’re going to an exhibition or taking out a book.”This notion of “hanging out” gets to the real function of Groningen’s artful new creation: namely, helping fellow citizens mix and mingle and – who knows? – perhaps even taste that nebulous yet ever-necessary thing called “community”.It’s a mission born, in part, out of Groningen’s struggling city centre. The hope is that the Forum will revitalise the main market square, which, after the German occupation during the second world war was home to a dingy car park for decades.At the same time, the project marks a bold riposte to the effects of modern-day capitalist society: first, in its promotion of an inidualistic society and second, in its commercialisation of public space (ie with malls and coffee bars gradually replacing libraries and community centres).This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. The Forum is a splendid example of form following function. Clean and contemporary, the final design shouts anything but library. Hotel lobby, perhaps? Department store, even? From the luminous circular information desk, to the free-floating elevators, to the immense, cathedral-esque atrium. It’s all quite discombobulating and really rather marvellous.Once through the door, the challenge is to make people stay. It’s all about “the experience”, says Nijdam, borrowing from big retail’s mantra de jour. So no security beefs on the door, no blaring Tannoy announcements, no endless queuing. Instead, it’s all soft furnishings, mood lighting and make-yourself-at-home courtesy.Signposts are also kept to a minimum. Exploration, not explanation, is the building’s guiding motif, says Kamiel Klaasse co-founder of NL Architects, an upstart Amsterdam-based firm that beat off an all-star list (including the late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid) to win the design contract way back in 2006.“The brief talked as much about searching as about finding and we interpreted that as an incentive to let people roam,” Klaasse says.The Groningen resident and social activist Ritzo ten Cate is an early cheerleader for the project. Describing the Forum as “one big welcome gesture to us as citizens”, he points to the ersity of the building’s users as proof of its communitarian qualities.The evidence seems solid. On any given day, you’ll find students working at their laptops, mums with their toddlers, school kids on assignment and grannies reading newspapers. All of them together, under one roof, seemingly as one.Nor is it just Groningen’s well-heeled citizens who make use of the space. On his many visits, Ten Cate regularly spots friends from the city’s homeless community. Some come to read or use the free internet, while others are after a warm corner to kill time or take a nap.“The Forum only opened a few months ago, but it’s already doing its job as a connector,” says Ten Cate, who has plans to run a large-scale hackathon there in June.But as much as the Forum brings people together, is it serving to create community.For Paul de Rook, an alderman on Groningen city council, it’s a crucial question. More than just shared physical space, genuine community is about a shared understanding of one another, he argues. “That’s why it’s really valuable to create spaces where people … can see what is going on in other people’s lives.”In a nod to this reality, the Forum seeks to orient all its cultural activities around a common thread. Whether it’s the current exhibition on artificial intelligence (recently on show at the Barbican in London) or Spike Jonze’s futuristic film Her at the cinema, everyone is collectively inching towards the same page (“optimism about the future”, in the Forum’s case).Dr Ward Rauws admires the sentiment but harbours doubts. An assistant professor of spatial planning at the University of Groningen, he notes that the core building blocks of community – social capital, civic culture, place identity and so forth – start first at a street-by-street level and expand out from there.Even so, he remains a big fan of Groningen’s Forum because of its role in helping foster “familiarity”. Echoing De Rook, he defines the term as a state of awareness that “other kinds of citizens exist who might think differently or look different, but who are part of the same community”. It’s a salient point for a university town such as Groningen, where town-gown tensions are a feature of daily life.Groningen’s audacious experiment in urban planning isn’t without its detractors, most of whom gripe about the final price-tag. Joris’s mum is in that camp. Her son begs to differ. Done with the BFG, he’s now playing a spelling game on one of the library’s iPads. His dad watches on patiently, albeit with half an eye on the upstairs cafe. “Afterwards,” he whispers, “we go for cake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e786e0590f036484f5c98744a5a7560e81ba17/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e840a5066a9fdaa3fec3368887149b9f","title":"italy faces calls to close everything to tackle coronavirus","story":"Authorities in virus-hit country consider further restrictions as Covid-19 takes hold in EuropeItaly’s government is considering the imposition of even tighter restrictions in the country’s most coronavirus-affected areas, including closing shops except for supermarkets and pharmacies and halting public transport, as the Covid-19 outbreak continues to upend daily life around the world.The country’s civil protection chief, Angelo Borrelli, said requests from senior politicians, including the opposition League leader Matteo Salvini, to “close everything” in the northern Lombardy and Veneto regions “must be examined, considered and assessed”.Italy’s 62 million people were barred on Monday from all travel unless certified as justified on professional or health grounds and told to stay mostly at home as the country tackles the virus, which has infected more than 10,000 people and killed 631.Shops, cafes and restaurants remain open, but police were enforcing rules requiring customers to stay one metre (3ft) apart and many businesses to close at 6pm. In 11 towns placed in lockdown more than two weeks ago, evidence emerged appearing to suggest the infection rate might be falling.Hungary banned all travel from Italy, South Korea, Iran and China and announced it would close universities and ban public gatherings. Austria suspended all remaining trains to Italy.Italy’s ambassador to the EU has criticised a lack of solidarity from the bloc, saying it must come up with “emergency actions that are quick, concrete and effective”. Charles Michel, the president of the European council, said member states “stood ready to make use of all instruments necessary”.The bloc’s four priorities were limiting the spread of the virus, ensuring supplies of medical equipment, promoting research on vaccines and treatment, and handling the economic fallout, Michel said after a leaders’ conference call late on Tuesday.The EU pledged to release funds worth up to €25bn (£22bn), with the commission making €7.5bn available to trigger €17.5-€18bn in co-funding from national governments. The bloc will also also be flexible in implementing its rules on state aid to allow governments to subsidise industry as required.Among other developments:The coronavirus has disrupted travel, closed schools, halted manufacturing and played havoc with sporting, cultural and political events around the world. In the US, the number of cases has exceeded 1,000 and at least 28 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Amid criticism of the US authorities’ response, New York deployed the national guard for the first time during the crisis to help contain the spread of the disease from an infection-hit suburb. “It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. This is literally a matter of life and death,” said the state governor, Andrew Cuomo.Several major events, including the Coachella music festival, were postponed, Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled campaign rallies, colleges around the country began teaching classes online, and there were mounting concerns about the spread of the virus in residential care homes.As multiple European countries banned public events with more than 1,000 people, closed schools and shut their borders to people entering from virus-affected states, the economic impact of the virus – and the measures introduced to contain it – grew.In Spain, the festival of las Fallas in Valencia – worth an estimated €700m to the region’s economy – was suspended indefinitely. The Spanish hoteliers’ association has asked the government to help the sector, which faces a possibly disastrous Easter.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Governments have scrambled to promise help for companies and households affected by the epidemic, offering to extend credit to small businesses, postpone tax payment deadlines and pay compensation to people with childcare responsibilities or in self-isolation. Italy unveiled a €25bn rescue package on Wednesday.In China, where the coronavirus originated, officials have declared the epidemic “basically curbed”, reporting only 24 new cases on Wednesday. The country is more concerned about importing new cases: all of those reported in Beijing on Wednesday came from outside the country, five from Italy and one from the US.Some key industries in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, were told they could resume work on Wednesday, a day after President Xi Jinping visited the city of 11 million that has been in lockdown since late January. The virus has so far infected 80,778 people in China and killed 3,158.The other major outbreak site in Asia, South Korea, continued to report improving numbers, too, with 242 new cases announced on Wednesday, although a cluster of infections connected to a call centre continued to cause concern. Japan marked the ninth anniversary of the tsunami that led to the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, but public commemorations were radically scaled back.A senior member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics organising committee said a one- or two-year delay would be the “most feasible” option if the Games, due to be held in July and August, had to be cancelled, but the committee’s head dismissed the suggestion as “outrageous”.The epidemic has prompted pandemonium on global markets, with volatility not seen since the world financial crisis in 2008. While the Dow Jones Index in New York bounced back on Tuesday after a disastrous day on Monday, Asian markets were mostly down on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93139964572f7010ff92a8d701f853ae867f209a/0_127_3801_2281/master/3801.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d22884bbd53efcc04af7b97e13e0c329","title":"uk more nostalgic for empire than other ex colonial powers","story":"European colonial powers still loth to admit historical evilsA third of people in the UK believe Britain’s colonies were better off for being part of an empire, a higher proportion than in any of the other major colonial powers, a global survey has revealed.Britons are also more likely to say they would like their country to still have an empire than people in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany or Japan, the YouGov polling found.The results were shared with the  as Britain prepares to find a new place in the international order after Brexit. They have been interpreted by some as a proxy for high levels of nationalist sentiment. Conservative voters were almost twice as likely as Labour voters to yearn for Britain to still have an empire, while Brexit-supporting leave voters were more than twice as pro-empire than remainers.The results were described as “alarming” by Oku Ekpenyon, who is leading a campaign for Britain to erect a new memorial to the transatlantic slave trade, which has so far failed to attract government backing. She said they raised questions about British education on colonial topics and highlighted the country’s tendency towards nostalgia.Only the Netherlands appears to be more proud of its imperial history than the UK. Half of Dutch respondents said it was something to be more proud of than ashamed.Ekpenyon said the large number of Britons with ambivalent views made her “wonder about their education” and she recalled her own schooling in the UK being taught about “David Livingstone and Mary Slessor going to Calabar and doing good for the savages on the benighted continent”.“There are people who do not recognise the contribution that people of African heritage make to this country,” she said. “Look at the Windrush scandal.”She highlighted a speech made by Prince Charles on a visit to Accra in Ghana in 2018 in which he apologised for the “appalling atrocity of the slave trade”. He said that while Britain led the abolition movement it has “a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten”. She suggested he needed to make this speech to a British audience to shift attitudes.Jon Wilson, professor of modern history at King’s College London, said the likelihood that a country believes it left its former colonies better off appeared to be correlated to the extent and openness of the national debate about empire.In the UK, people aged over 64 were more than twice as likely to be proud of empire than those aged 18-24, the polling showed, which Wilson suggested may be linked to improved teaching.“There are syllabuses that don’t shy away from the brutal truth,” he said. “But the broader public debate about empire is extremely thin and gets used as a proxy for nationalism.”Lisa Nandy, a Labour leadership candidate, last month pledged to remove references to empire in the honours system, turning, for example, the Order of the British Empire into the Order of British Excellence.Meanwhile the rightwing historian and Churchill biographer Andrew Roberts has argued that Brexit is a moment to reclaim the meaning of empire as a state where “no foreign power is able to alter or countermand the laws made here”. Some in the Conservative party have said Brexit is a moment for “the empire to strike back”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb763183be999a9984302df1e9b413ac8dc4af2/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a83a4fdb731be212cfdc73520da235","title":"coronavirus closes down italy","story":"With Italy in lockdown, Peter Beaumont charts the spread of Covid-19 in the country while Lorenzo Tondo describes its impact.

Photograph: Alex WelshThe New York TimesAre you washing your hands correctly? While most Irish people have become much more focused when it comes to hand hygiene in recent days as fears over the impact of coronavirus have grown, a leading virologist at Trinity College Dublin has warned that the techniques employed by many are still wrong and could leave viruses on hands and fingernails.Using UV lights and a reflective cream to mimic the spread of a virus, the leader of the virology research group at Trinity, Dr Kim Roberts, was able to show just how hard it can be to clean human hands effectively.When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands, then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection.That is why frequent hand-washing and the use of hand sanitisers are so important in combating the spread of the Covid-19.Dr Roberts demonstrated how quick hand-washes were utterly useless and only served to spread the virus to arms and clothes, while even a relatively vigorous handwashing was only partially effective.She reminded people that not only do they need to wash their hands “for a minimum of 20 seconds”, they also need to allow soap to do its work before rinsing hands in water.FingernailsShe highlighted the need to ensure all parts of the hands including fingernails were washed with equal vigour.The HSE, the Department of Health and all medical experts have been reinforcing the need for people to take greater care with hand hygiene in order to curtail – in so far as is possible – the spread of coronavirus.The results of a huge study in 2015, and published in the Lancet, proved the importance of hand washing to prevent the mass spread of an illness such as coronavirus.Researchers at the University of Southampton randomly ided more than 20,000 people from GP lists into two groups, one of which was invited to visit a website designed to encourage people to wash their hands, while the other group didn’t get access.While effects weren’t huge, with 10-20 per cent reductions in infections and consultations among the former group, these small effects extrapolated to population level would produce huge benefits from a cheap and easily accessed intervention.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199181.1583876011!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rush to book earlier flights out of italy likely as airlines announce halts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing face masks walk at Leonardo da Vinci airport near Rome.

Aer Lingus will ground its planes starting today.British Airways has also cancelled all flights to and from Italy until April 4th, and other airlines have taken similar steps.The cancellations, for a four-week period, came in response to the Italian government announcing that the country was being locked down, with travel and movement of people severely restricted as it attempted to contain the spread of Covid-19.The move by the Irish airlines was all but inevitable after Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney updated his department’s travel advice on Tuesday, warning Irish citizens against travel to any part of Italy unless absolutely necessary.It was also facilitated by the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who confirmed that the EU was temporarily dropping strict rules stating that airlines must operate 80 per cent of scheduled services to keep their landing slots at airports.Earlier flightsRyanair, which is halting flights to and from Italy until April 8th, said passengers looking to be repatriated by it could obtain a move to an earlier Ryanair flight for free.Passengers due to travel to Italy will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next 12 months.Aer Lingus flights to and from Italy are expected to be suspended from today.Irish people with plans to travel to Italy as part of a package holiday will have to talk with tour operators to see what options they have while those who have booked trip’s independently will need to talk to your their travel insurer.People who have booked independently and do not have travel insurance already in place will most likely not have anything to fall back on and will have to bear the cost themselves.Italy’s nationwide lockdown limits travel to those with “verifiable work requirements or situations of necessity”.All sporting events have been suspended, and schools and universities have been shut until April 3rd.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTalks between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on forming a government will begin on Wednesday after a breakthrough between the two parties came amid increasing fears in political circles about the coronavirus. Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin last night issued identical statements saying that their negotiating teams should “now commence indepth detailed talks”. The leaders also said they would continue talks with the Green Party, which senior figures in both parties hope will join a historic coalition government.The move towards a coalition between the two parties – rivals since the 1920s that have never before shared power – comes more than a month after a general election that saw both lose seats and Sinn Féin’s popularity surge. Fianna Fáil currently has 37 TDs and Fine Gael has 35, meaning an alliance of the two would be eight votes short of a Dáil majority. This means additional support would be needed, with the Green Party and its 12 TDs seen as a possible route to securing a majority in the House. Rivals coalescingFine Gael and Fianna Fáil have refused to speak to Sinn Féin, which has 37 TDs, about forming a government, making a combination of the two the only viable administration. However, despite the progress reported last night, there remains considerable resistance to the idea of the rivals coalescing in both parties.An initial meeting will take place on Wednesday and this will be followed by more detailed exchanges in the coming days. A spokesman for the Taoiseach said Mr Varadkar would seek the approval of the Fine Gael parliamentary party next week before “formal” talks on a programme for government take place.The breakthrough after weeks of inconclusive contacts between various parties comes amid mounting concerns in Government about the threat from coronavirus, and the social and economic impact its spreading could have.‘Equal partners’“Both leaders are acutely aware of the enormous challenges facing the country particularly with the onset of Covid-19,” the party statements said. Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar said they would “enter the talks as equal partners determined to develop proposals which will serve the interests of the people of Ireland”. This is being interpreted as an acknowledgment that any coalition government would involving Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar alternating as the coalition leader. In an email to Fine Gael members, Mr Varadkar said his party was “once again . . . needed to stand by the State and our Republic”. He said he had intended to allow Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin time to try to form a government “either together or separately” but that the “public health emergency” posed by Covid-19 changed the context.

Photographs: Gareth ChaneyCollins \u0026 Alan BetsonThe Fears about the spread of the coronavirus and its implications for national life are accelerating in Government by the day. This will change the political context in the short-term and - if the outbreak is as bad as the worst-case scenarios project - it will change society and politics profoundly over the longer term.The immediate sign that the political context is changing is in the acceleration of the government formation process. At the weekend, senior figures in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael played down the prospect of any meaningful engagement on coalition formation between the two parties. This suggested that with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar bound for the US, and the Dáil being adjourned until March 19th, it would be after St Patrick’s Day before any serious business could be done. But now things are happening much quicker. The announcement by the two parties on Tuesday that they would begin “in depth detailed talks” is the biggest breakthrough in the process since the election and came after meetings between Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin in recent days. TDs in both parties had begun to express impatience, believing that the public will not tolerate the sort of shilly-shallying that has marked engagements before now. Deputies in all parties believe voters will quickly run out of patience with politicians if serious moves towards forming a government are not made soon.There are very few people seriously entertaining the idea of a national government being assembled to deal with the crisis. This was partly because of an awareness that if difficult decisions have to be taken quickly, then a government containing all shades of opinion would be the worst vehicle imaginable for doing so. Even Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald pooh-poohed the idea.Extraordinarily difficultNone of this means that a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Greens government will be any easier to assemble. The policy and politics will still be extraordinarily difficult. But there is no question that the rising fear - amongst the public and within the political apparatus - has changed the external context significantly, and is pushing the two big parties together in a way it wasn’t previously.There is also, however, a realisation that the benign economic weather for any incoming administration has changed drastically. The shock to the world economy currently being delivered by the coronavirus outbreak is as yet unquantifiable but will certainly impact Ireland’s public finances. Therefore the resources available to the next government for large-scale investment in, for example, housing - an area where major action is viewed as being essential in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil - is unclear. Efforts to combat the virus are also likely to lead to a significant expansion in health spending, as well as footing the bill for the extension of sick leave, even as businesses face a cash crunch. The bottom line is that the next government will be doing a lot of up-front spending because of the crisis. This will restrict their options elsewhere for the sort of spending commitments that pad out a programme for government and make agreeing a policy platform easier.But the effects of the virus on Irish politics may well go far beyond an acceleration of government formation and big costs for the public purse. If the crisis deteriorates to the extent that the healthcare system is completely overwhelmed and the State cannot cope, that is likely to shatter public confidence in politics and parties that would inevitably be seen by people to have failed.

Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link. Roughly 6,000 tests had been done in the Netherlands as of March 7th, national public health institute the RIVM said, a figure that includes double-testing to exclude false positives, and testing for recovery.Twelve days after the first diagnosis, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands had risen from 1 to 382.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199165.1583882292!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italy s streets empty in historic lockdown to halt spread of coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeserted Via del Corso in Rome: Austria banned entry to people from Italy on Tuesday, introducing checks on its border.  Photograph: Tiziana FabiAFPStreets across Italy were deserted as the government ordered all citizens to stay at home to curb the worst outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, implementing controls unprecedented in a western nation since the second World War.The death toll from the virus jumped to 631 out of 10,149 confirmed cases on Tuesday, though authorities warned this data was incomplete as the region at the centre of the outbreak, Lombardy, had not given its full numbers.“Together we can do it,” health minister Roberto Speranza appealed in a Facebook post promoting the so-called stay-at-home law. “We are aware we are asking for sacrifices, these are however indispensable. Now more than ever, everyone’s contribution is decisive.”On Monday night, prime minister Giuseppe Conte placed the entire country under quarantine without warning, rolling out controls previously in place only for the worst-hit areas.Nearly three in four deaths have been in Lombardy, a hub of industry and Italy’s richest region, and the government is desperate to prevent the outbreak descending on the country’s poorer south, where less developed health services could struggle to cope.Citizens must fill out a form to justify any venture out of the house. They can do so for proven work reasons, necessities like food shopping, health reasons or to return to their place of residence.Police controlsThere are police checks on roads and at train stations, and people violating the law can be fined and imprisoned for three months. Anyone who has tested positive for the virus, or has been ordered to quarantine due to possible exposure, is completely banned from leaving home.All sport in the country is suspended until April 3rd, including Serie A football, in a situation described by Italy’s Olympic Committee CONI as having “no precedent in history”.As stock markets ed and the widening shutdown of economic activity threatened to trigger a crash, the European Commission announced it would use all tools available to boost economies.“The crisis we face because of coronavirus has both a very significant human dimension and a potentially major economic impact,” said commission president Ursula von der Leyen after a teleconference with EU leaders, as she announced state aid and borrowing rules would be eased and hinted at intervention from the European Central Bank in a bid to calm markets.“It is therefore essential that we act very decisively and collectively first of all to contain the spread of the virus and help patients, and to counter the economic fallout,” she said.Austrian banAustria banned entry to people from Italy on Tuesday, introducing checks on its border, an exceptional move for two countries that are part of the check-free Schengen zone.“The utmost priority is to prevent the spread and thus the importing of the illness into our society,” chancellor Sebastian Kurz told a news conference. “There is therefore a ban on entry for people from Italy into Austria, with the exception of people who have a doctor’s note.”New figures released by Italian public health body the ISS showed that one in four cases identified in Italy as of March 9th were hospitalised, with 19 per cent “critical”.While a fifth of diagnoses were among people aged 19-50, more than half of deaths were of people aged over 80, a third were people in their 70s, one in 10 were of people in their 60s.“These data confirm how all age groups contribute to the spread of infection, and unfortunately the worst effects affect frail elderly people,” said ISS chief Silvio Brusaferro as she urged younger people to take the virus seriously.“Giving up a party or an aperitif with friends . . . is a duty to protect your own health and that of others, especially the most fragile.”The country shut down schools in several regions, suspended flights from Italy and advised against all non-essential travel on Tuesday in the hope of stemming a rising tide of coronavirus cases.The number of confirmed cases increased threefold from Sunday and tenfold in a week, prompting Spain, which had so far taken few drastic steps, to change tack and announce a slew of measures.The government banned indoor gatherings of more than 1,000 people in the most affected regions – Madrid, the Rioja wine-growing region and two areas in the northern Basque Country, while all La Liga football matches will be played behind closed doors for at least two weeks.US President Donald Trump said the coronavirus outbreak would “go away” and urged Americans to remain calm as cases jumped and the White House came under mounting pressure to boost its response to the health and economic crisis.A steady rise in the number of US cases of Covid-19 has spurred calls within Congress for action to expand testing and avert an economic meltdown. About three-quarters of US states now have confirmed Covid-19 with more than 800 Americans infected.Washington state’s governor warned of tens of thousands more cases without “real action” and New York’s governor deployed National Guard troops as a containment measure in a hard-hit New York City suburb.“It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away,” Mr Trump said after a meeting on Capitol Hill with Republican lawmakers. “We want to protect our shipping industry, our cruise industry, cruise ships. We want to protect our airlines industry.”Mr Trump, who in the past two days has broached a payroll tax cut and relief for companies hard hit by coronavirus fears, offered no specific details on what had been discussed in a meeting with his top economic officials.Greece and North Macedonia Both countries on Tuesday announced all schools, universities and kindergartens would be shut for the next 14 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199224.1583881862!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk junior health minister diagnosed with coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative MP Nadine Dorries: ‘I can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus.

There were 299 active coronavirus cases in Britain on Monday, up from 32 at the start of last week – an increase of 834 per cent over the seven days. It took four days for the UK\u0027s number of cases to last double, from 106 on March 5 to 299 on March 9, putting the country in the middle of the pack in terms of the doubling rate of the virus.This is less than the rate of increase in Spain, where active cases have doubled in just two days. There, 460 people were said to have the virus, but that had increase to 1,013 on Monday.The doubling rate is, however, lower in countries in which the virus is already more established and has infected more people. In Japan and South Korea, for example, it took coronavirus nine days to last double its number of active cases.The countries with the highest number of recorded active cases as of Monday were China (18,880), Italy (7,985) and South Korea (7,307).It is important to note that other countries may have higher undetected cases because the official numbers are reliant upon rigorous testing and data collection methods in each country.The number of active cases in China – and in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus – has fallen over the last week. Hubei has seen active cases drop by 40 per cent since last Monday, while in China the number has dropped by 67 per cent.While cases are still rising in South Korea, the country\u0027s rate of growth has slowed with cases currently doubling every nine days. The most concerning trajectory is in Italy, which has the second highest number of confirmed active cases and is currently seeing that number double every three days. The main goal for the UK Government as it faces coronavirus is to contain and delay it – part of its four-point contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy.This timeline is defined by the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios as it moves across Europe, and is taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU\u0027s main public health body. But looking at case data from across Europe, it\u0027s clear that different European countries are at different stages of this strategy – and with different levels of success.Most countries managed to delay major surges in cases for at least 20 days as the number of infections in Europe remained low.Daily data sourced from the World Health Organisation and compiled by John Hopkins University shows that some of the worst affected countries were able to contain the disease for weeks.In Italy, the first substantial increase in active cases (533 per cent) did not occur for 21 days after the country had detected its first case. The UK is following a similar trajectory, with a 400 per cent increase in active cases after 24 days.Countries detecting the virus later appear to be less successful in keeping numbers low. In Austria, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands, the virus was detected for the first time less than two weeks ago. But once it was present, each country saw the number of confirmed cases double – or even triple – in the first three days.Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology at University College London, told The  he thought it likely that the UK would follow the same pattern as Italy over the coming weeks.The trajectory of the epidemic in the UK is so far roughly comparable to the one in Northern Italy, but with the epidemic in northern Italy two to three weeks ahead of the situation in the UK, he said.The above graphic shows the speed at which cases increased in Italy. While lagging in total numbers, confirmed cases in the UK have doubled roughly once every three days in the last week, suggesting that Britain is on much the same track.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nadine dorries infected coronavirus","story":"Public health officials are seeking to trace anyone who has been in contact with Nadine Dorries after it emerged that the health minister had contracted coronavirus.Her boss Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, may have to be tested if he displays symptoms.Ms Dorries, who has met hundreds of people as part of her duties, became ill last Friday but was not confirmed to have the virus until Monday evening. As officials scrambled to trace people who may have been in contact with her, Public Health England said it had assessed the risk of her inidual close contacts and only those with symptoms needed to self-isolate.One of those is the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who has been advised to self-isolate after a meeting with Ms Dorries last Thursday. But Downing Street sources say Boris Johnson was not in close contact with his health minister and has not shown any symptoms.Ms Dorries has been working in Parliament and the Department of Health and Social Care for the past week, and on Thursday attended a Downing Street event with the Prime Minister.Experts believe people infected with the virus can carry it for up to five days before symptoms emerge. Ms Dorries, 62, started feeling ill on Friday as she was signing a statutory instrument that declared coronavirus to be a notifiable disease, enabling companies to obtain insurance cover. The health minister held a surgery in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency on Saturday, attended by 50 people, and over the weekend experienced the classic symptoms of the disease – a dry cough, high temperature and vice-like pain in her chest.A government source said: As with everything, we are being guided by the science on this. This will be treated like any other standard case. Officials are conducting the standard process of contact tracing and identifying anyone who has shown symptoms.A health department source said: We are lucky in the timing, because Matt last saw Nadine last Wednesday and her symptoms only came on at the back end of the week. Matt has no symptoms, and therefore is okay.Nadine self-isolated on Saturday, so over the weekend it\u0027s hoped all traces were gone. We know Nadine was in Number 10 last week, but it is not certain how much contact she had with the PM. You have to be within two metres for more than 20 minutes.The disclosure will raise concerns about whether Parliament needs to be curtailed. Earlier this week, the parliamentary authorities decided against taking action to either restrict access to Parliament or close it down. Mr Hancock said it should stay open because scrutiny is incredibly important during the outbreak.The decision was due to be reviewed early next week. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has warned elderly peers and MPs that they may be told to stay at home for their own protection.On Tuesday night, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said there were no current plans to shut down parliament. Parliamentary authorities are already taking advice from the chief medical officer and will continue to do so, he said.Sources said the feeling inside Number 10 was that Parliament needed to be kept open. One Cabinet minister said: There\u0027s a feeling at all levels that Parliament needs to remain operational to pass the PM\u0027s emergency legislation and the finance bill.Ms Dorries is understood to be over the worst and recovering well. She tweeted: Thanks for so many good wishes. It\u0027s been pretty rubbish, but I hope I\u0027m over the worst of it now. More worried about my 84yo mum who is staying with me and began with the cough today.She is being tested tomorrow. Keep safe and keep washing those hands, everyone.A Government source said: The PHE (Public Health England) contract tracers are doing their work. They will identify who needs to self-isolate or be tested and take it from there.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"2020 democrat primaries joe biden projected win mississippi","story":"Joe Biden took a commanding lead in the Democratic presidential nomination race last night, winning four states and triggering calls for Bernie Sanders to end his campaign. The former US vice president was projected to take Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho and Michigan, a state Mr Sanders won in the 2016 race, handing him a sizable delegate lead.The two other states which went to the polls on so-called Super Tuesday Two, Washington and North Dakota, remained too close to call at 1am US east coast time. The victories underscored Mr Biden’s vast support among the African-American community but also showed he could compete among white working class voters whose backing Mr Sanders has touted.The results made Mr Sanders’s path to the nomination even narrower, given Mr Biden’s widened lead in delegates - the metric that will determine the winner - and tough states coming up next in the next round of voting on Tuesday.  Mr Biden, speaking near his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia after cancelling a rally in Ohio due to coronavirus concerns, gave a pared back address as he chose to embrace Mr Sanders and call for unity rather than attack his rival. “I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal, and together, we’ll defeat Donald Trump,” said Mr Biden, who will need Sanders supporters on side should he become the nominee and fight the November election. Speaking from a teleprompter, Mr Biden also repeatedly talked about the need to unify, saying: “Winning means uniting America, not sowing more ision and anger. It means not only having a president who knows how to fight but knows how to heal.” After the event Biden campaign staffers, who had made up the audience for the speech thanks to the late switch of venue, danced wildly to music and chanted “Let’s Go Joe!” as they celebrated the victories. By contrast Mr Sanders, in a sign of disappointment at the early outcomes, took the unusual step of not speaking publicly on results night. He was at home in Vermont after also cancelling an Ohio event due to coronavirus fears. His national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, insisted Mr Sanders would appear at the debate against Mr Biden on Sunday, with another four states to vote next Tuesday, but there was little public comment from the campaign.  Mr Sanders has repeatedly said he will back whoever wins the nomination and this weekend played down the likelihood of continuing in the race if there was no path to victory. High profile Democratic moderates including Bill Clinton’s former campaign manager James Carville and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn urged him to drop out on Tuesday evening. “Let’s shut this puppy down,” said Mr Carville. “Let’s move on and worry about November. This thing is decided, there’s no reason to keep it going, not even a day longer.”Andrew Yang, the former contender for the Democratic nomination who backed Mr Sanders in 2016, announced live on CNN he would be endorsing Mr Biden, saying: “The math says Joe is our prohibitive nominee.”Despite more than half the 50 states in America still to vote, Mr Sanders’s path to the White House is less clear after the results, with many of the states voting next Tuesday ones he failed to win in the 2016 race. However at a results watch party for Mr Sanders’s supporters at the Anchor Bar in Detroit, Michigan there was defiance and frustration among his fans. One volunteer, James, said he had travelled all the way from Oakland, California to spend two weeks knocking on doors for Mr Sanders in Michigan.He rejected the idea that Mr Sanders should drop out of the race, saying: Biden will never form the social contract the way that Bernie will.” Cheryl Herrman, another volunteer, shook her head when asked if she would back Mr Biden should he become the nominee, pointing to past comments he had made about segregationists. Early in the night a local campaign official stood up to thank volunteers for their efforts, saying: “I want you all to remember that this movement is not about a ballot box.” The night underscored Mr Biden’s remarkable primaries turnaround. A fortnight ago he had never won a state in his three White House bids stretching back three decades. He has now notched up more than a dozen victories. That surge, which aides dubbed “the Biden bounce back”, had been triggered by a strong performance in South Carolina combined with a flurry of endorsements from moderate rivals who dropped out of the race. Mr Biden’s vast support among the African-American community was apparent again on Tuesday, winning 87 per cent to Mr Sanders’s 10 per cent with black voters in Mississippi.In Michigan, Mr Sanders dropped support across the board with white voters compared to his 2016 performance., underscoring the limits of his voter coalition. Mr Sanders, effectively in a head-to head battle with Mr Biden, needed victories to show his bid would not be swept aside by “Joementum”. Instead early in the night he lost Michigan, a state he beat Hillary Clinton in during the 2016 race.Mr Biden had secured more than 800 delegates by 1am US east coast time while Mr Sanders was yet to reach 700. The first to 1,991 delegates wins the nomination. Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman who remains in the race despite barely breaking through with Democratic voters, again made little dent in the contests on Tuesday. Mr Trump stayed largely quiet on the Democratic race on Twitter as results came through but around 1am he tweeted accusing Elizabeth Warren of having “totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders” by not dropping out earlier.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden crushed bernie sanders revolution","story":"Two weeks is an eternity in politics. Just ask Bernie Sanders.It was only that long ago he was cruising to the Democrat presidential nomination, and very possibly the White House.The prospect of America becoming a democratic socialist country was real.But US elections can turn on a dime, and that’s what happened in 2020.It wasn’t so much what went wrong for Mr Sanders. His rallies are still huge. He has suffered no major scandal.Instead, it was what went right for Joe Biden. It started when South Carolina voted on Feb 29, and the state\u0027s black population backed the former vice president en masse.Over the next few days centrist candidates dropped out and united behind Mr Biden, propelling him to victory on Super Tuesday. It all happened so quickly Mr Sanders was left reeling.He responded with a frenzy. On Sunday, Mr Sanders achieved the rare feat of appearing on all five major US political chat shows. His campaign fired out negative TV adverts against Mr Biden.But on Tuesday night he was trounced, by more than expected, in the southern states of Mississippi and Missouri.Then, Mr Sanders lost Michigan, the industrial rust belt state he had taken against Hillary Clinton four years earlier.It was a hammer blow, a potentially fatal one, for the Sanders campaign. Any Democrat running against Donald Trump in November would have to win Michigan.It showed, once and for all, that Mr Sanders\u0027 revolution is not happening, or at least not on the scale he needed it to.In state after state, so far, there has been no explosion in voter turnout.There has been no horde of factory workers uniting around the promise of government-funded universal healthcare.And no flood of millennials raised from their sofas on voting day by the prospect of free college tuition under a Sanders administration.In Michigan, Mr Sanders did win 82 per cent of voters aged under 30. But there simply weren\u0027t enough of them. They were swept away by a grey tide of over-65s backing Mr Biden.Mr Sanders failed, in the end, to conquer the apathy of the young.An additional blow came as anecdotal evidence in Michigan suggested Elizabeth Warren\u0027s supporters had sided with Mr Biden.Ms Warren, a standard bearer for the Democrats\u0027s progressive wing, dropped out after Super Tuesday.It would have seemed natural for her to endorse her friend Mr Sanders, but she decided to back no-one immediately.Exit polls also showed that many Democrat voters, including some of Mr Sanders\u0027 own supporters, believe the time has come to unify the party.Their overwhelming motivation is to defeat Mr Trump, and many appear to have decided that Mr Biden has the best chance.For Mr Sanders, there is no way to tack his policies to the prevailing wind. They are set in stone.In a week\u0027s time several other large states vote including Florida, where he is now 40 points behind Mr Biden in polls.It is becoming increasingly difficult to see a rationale for him to go on.His only realistic hope lies in a debate with Mr Biden on Sunday.It will be the first one-on-one encounter between the two men, and Mr Sanders is widely considered the stronger debater.He will use it to make a final argument that the Democrats should pick a nominee who represents the starkest contrast to Mr Trump.Mr Sanders will need to not only win the debate, but eviscerate Mr Biden, if the race is to continue.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/10/17/adidas.jpg","title":"adidas google fifa mobile 20 ultimate team gmr boot smart","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Playing physical football will lead to improvements in virtual playersAdidas, Google and the Fifa game have teamed up to create a smart football boot.The technology – known as Adidas GMR – watches how people play in real life, allowing them to complete challenges or hit milestones.When they do, they will be rewarded with improvements within Fifa Mobile, allowing them to unlock in-game rewards or improve the performance of their team within Fifa Mobile Ultimate Team.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe technology brings together insoles made for Adidas football boots with Google\u0027s Jacquard technology, which allows smart fabric to be sewn into otherwise normal pieces of clothing.It has already been integrated into backpacks and denim jackets, for instance, allowing wearers to swipe on a sleeve and change the song that is playing on their phone.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Pubs will see the discount they receive on business rates increased from £1,000 to £5,000.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollow live updates on the BudgetThe chancellor\u0026nbspalso announced a review into the long-term future of business rates, a tax which has been blamed for damaging UK high streets by burdening struggling firms with large bills that online competitors do not face.Cash grants of up to £3,000 will be made available to 700,000 small firms that already do not pay business rates.\u0026nbspCompanies with less than 250 staff will also receive funding totalling up to £2bn\u0026nbspto cover the cost of sick pay during the outbreak.Mr Sunak announced statutory sick pay would available for all of those advised to self isolate during the outbreak, even if they do not have symptoms. This will not extend to zero hours workers or those who are self employed.Instead, millions of gig economy workers will be given help through a £500m boost to the benefits system, including a temporary halt to the minimum floor in universal credit and quicker payments for employment and support allowance (ESA) claimants.£500m Budget boost for self-employed workers hit by coronavirusMr Sunak claimed the coronavirus response measures amounted to one of the most comprehensive economic responses of any government anywhere in the world to date.The government pledged to invest an extra £175bn\u0026nbspover the next five years in a move that will boost economic output by 0.5 per cent, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.Included in that figure will be an increase in spending on research and development to £22bn a year. The increase will take R\u0026ampD spending to its highest level as a proportion of GDP for almost 40 years, the chancellor said.Tom Leman, head of retail and consumer at law firm Pinsent Masons,\u0026nbspsaid: “The abolition of business rates for small to medium sized retailers and restaurants will be extremely welcome news.On the basis the corona virus is not a long term issue for these businesses it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst.This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a huge responsibility, and we know we’re going to make some mistakes.”Einhorn’s dilemma is playing out on a global stage. With the deadly virus now present in 100 countries, companies are unable to match demand for the masks needed by health workers. That’s led governments to jockey for supplies, including the US, which is stockpiling, and Germany and South Korea, which banned exports of masks altogether.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPublic health officials are warning that restrictive trade measures tied to medical supplies could worsen the shortfall and risk making poorer nations more vulnerable to the coronavirus’ spread.In some countries, including Japan and Germany, doctors are being told to reuse the single mask they get daily because of a lack of supply.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China“Most places are not prepared, so you now have a cascade of countries putting these export bans in place,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s not a long-term solution. Everyone throwing up export bans isn’t going to solve the problem of how you will get the products in time to serve these acute needs.”Peter Navarro, one of President Donald Trump’s trade advisers, met last week with a group of pharmaceutical companies to discuss supply chain vulnerabilities and ways to ensure that critical parts of the drug supply chain could move away from China -- or better, back to the U.S., people familiar with the meeting told Bloomberg. Navarro didn’t respond to requests for comment.Manufacturers need to boost production of masks by another 40 per cent\u0026nbspto meet demand, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general. While the WHO has shipped supplies to 47 countries including Iran, Cambodia and Uganda, shortages will hit soon, especially of the N95 masks that block out 95 per cent\u0026nbspof airborne particulates to combat the current virus.“Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding,” Tedros said in a statement 3 March. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first,” he said, referring to the illness caused by the virus.Despite Tedros’ appeal, South Korea, Germany and Russia announced export bans of masks and other protective gear days after. They join others nation or territories including India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Kazakhstan that earlier put export bans in place. The novel coronavirus has now spread to more than 113,000 cases globally and killed over 3,900 people.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories have since boosted production more than five-fold and are enlisting carmakers to manufacture them. That’s still not enough.In the US, increased efforts by mask makers 3M Co. and DuPont De Nemours Inc. are also falling short of demand. DuPont, which makes masks and protective body suits worn by first responders, said it’s increased production by more than three times its usual global capacity. 3M, the biggest American manufacturer of N95 respirators, has increased production since the outbreak in China.“We’ve added staff, we’ve added overtime, we’ve added technology, we’ve been increasing manufacturing lines,” said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich. “We expect this demand for respirators and other supplies to continue to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.”The dependence on China and a few other countries for masks has some calling for a rethink of supply chains. The World Medical Association, which represents physicians, wants governments to establish factories in major markets like the European Union and the U.S. to ensure adequate supply of critical drugs, vaccines and other medical necessities.The US only has about 1 per cent of the 3.5 billion masks it needs to combat a serious outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said. The country plans to buy 500 million surgical masks and N95 respirators for the national stockpile.Einhorn of Dealmed thinks the shortage isn’t likely to let up until the summer. The crisis may finally convince Americans to pay more for masks made in the US, he said. Dealmed is seeking bids for domestically-produced equipment.“The world shouldn’t be relying on one country for health care products,” Einhorn said. “We absolutely need to look at the supply chain.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown. It has cancelled most of its public events over the next month but said its rate-setting Governing Council meeting would go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The turmoil in global markets on Monday was deepened by\u0026nbspan all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which has led to stocks and oil prices tanking around the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The great variance in how well investments are protected from climate risk could leave savers and pension holders out of pocket.“More information is needed to help consumers make informed decisions. One option that the committee may explore is an EPC-style ‘carbon footprint’ rating of a financial product.“Another issue that the committee may examine is whether firms should be required to hold additional capital on assets exposed to climate risk.\u0026nbsp“Action is needed to help consumers navigate the market.

Pubs will see the discount they receive on business rates increased from £1,000 to £5,000.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollow live updates on the BudgetThe chancellor\u0026nbspalso announced a review into the long-term future of business rates, a tax which has been blamed for damaging UK high streets by burdening struggling firms with large bills that online competitors do not face.Cash grants of up to £3,000 will be made available to 700,000 small firms that already do not pay business rates.\u0026nbspCompanies with less than 250 staff will also receive funding totalling up to £2bn\u0026nbspto cover the cost of sick pay during the outbreak.Mr Sunak announced statutory sick pay would available for all of those advised to self isolate during the outbreak, even if they do not have symptoms. This will not extend to zero hours workers or those who are self employed.Instead, millions of gig economy workers will be given help through a £500m boost to the benefits system, including a temporary halt to the minimum floor in universal credit and quicker payments for employment and support allowance (ESA) claimants.£500m Budget boost for self-employed workers hit by coronavirusMr Sunak claimed the coronavirus response measures amounted to one of the most comprehensive economic responses of any government anywhere in the world to date.The government pledged to invest an extra £175bn\u0026nbspover the next five years in a move that will boost economic output by 0.5 per cent, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.Included in that figure will be an increase in spending on research and development to £22bn a year. The increase will take R\u0026ampD spending to its highest level as a proportion of GDP for almost 40 years, the chancellor said.Tom Leman, head of retail and consumer at law firm Pinsent Masons,\u0026nbspsaid: “The abolition of business rates for small to medium sized retailers and restaurants will be extremely welcome news.On the basis the corona virus is not a long term issue for these businesses it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst.This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a huge responsibility, and we know we’re going to make some mistakes.”Einhorn’s dilemma is playing out on a global stage. With the deadly virus now present in 100 countries, companies are unable to match demand for the masks needed by health workers. That’s led governments to jockey for supplies, including the US, which is stockpiling, and Germany and South Korea, which banned exports of masks altogether.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPublic health officials are warning that restrictive trade measures tied to medical supplies could worsen the shortfall and risk making poorer nations more vulnerable to the coronavirus’ spread.In some countries, including Japan and Germany, doctors are being told to reuse the single mask they get daily because of a lack of supply.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China“Most places are not prepared, so you now have a cascade of countries putting these export bans in place,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s not a long-term solution. Everyone throwing up export bans isn’t going to solve the problem of how you will get the products in time to serve these acute needs.”Peter Navarro, one of President Donald Trump’s trade advisers, met last week with a group of pharmaceutical companies to discuss supply chain vulnerabilities and ways to ensure that critical parts of the drug supply chain could move away from China -- or better, back to the U.S., people familiar with the meeting told Bloomberg. Navarro didn’t respond to requests for comment.Manufacturers need to boost production of masks by another 40 per cent\u0026nbspto meet demand, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general. While the WHO has shipped supplies to 47 countries including Iran, Cambodia and Uganda, shortages will hit soon, especially of the N95 masks that block out 95 per cent\u0026nbspof airborne particulates to combat the current virus.“Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding,” Tedros said in a statement 3 March. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first,” he said, referring to the illness caused by the virus.Despite Tedros’ appeal, South Korea, Germany and Russia announced export bans of masks and other protective gear days after. They join others nation or territories including India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Kazakhstan that earlier put export bans in place.

Factories have since boosted production more than five-fold and are enlisting carmakers to manufacture them. That’s still not enough.In the US, increased efforts by mask makers 3M Co. and DuPont De Nemours Inc. are also falling short of demand. DuPont, which makes masks and protective body suits worn by first responders, said it’s increased production by more than three times its usual global capacity. 3M, the biggest American manufacturer of N95 respirators, has increased production since the outbreak in China.“We’ve added staff, we’ve added overtime, we’ve added technology, we’ve been increasing manufacturing lines,” said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich. “We expect this demand for respirators and other supplies to continue to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.”The dependence on China and a few other countries for masks has some calling for a rethink of supply chains. The World Medical Association, which represents physicians, wants governments to establish factories in major markets like the European Union and the U.S. to ensure adequate supply of critical drugs, vaccines and other medical necessities.The US only has about 1 per cent of the 3.5 billion masks it needs to combat a serious outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said. The country plans to buy 500 million surgical masks and N95 respirators for the national stockpile.Einhorn of Dealmed thinks the shortage isn’t likely to let up until the summer. The crisis may finally convince Americans to pay more for masks made in the US, he said. Dealmed is seeking bids for domestically-produced equipment.“The world shouldn’t be relying on one country for health care products,” Einhorn said. “We absolutely need to look at the supply chain.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Apple\u0027s annual WWDC event, which marks the highlight of its year for new software features and its developers, is also likely to be cancelled under the ban.Apple holds its new phone launches in its Steve Jobs Theater, which has a capacity of 1,000 and is usually fully packed.\u0026nbspIt is very possible that Apple could launch the new phone without a large scale event, and it has released products with much smaller events or without a launch event at all in the past.Its Worldwide Developers Conference brings together more than 5,000 developers and as a consequence is even less likely to go ahead. That event has not yet been announced either but runs on an annual schedule, being held in San Jose every year.Previous reports have suggested that Apple\u0027s product pipeline – including the iPhone 12, which is expected much later in the year – could be affected by coronavirus, which is reducing both demand for new devices as well as the ability to supply enough models in time.It will also mean other major events such as sporting fixtures will no longer go ahead.The ban had been brought in to slow the spread of the disease, said\u0026nbspSanta Clara County health officer\u0026nbspSara Cody in a statement.Created with Sketch.Streets of Italy empty in coronavirus lockdown Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Via Partenope in Naples is empty after Italy was put on lockdown on 10 March A waiter stands by empty tables outside a restaurant in St Mark\u0027s Square in Venice on 9 MarchEmpty stands during a football match between Sassuolo and Brescia at the Mapei stadium in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy on 9 MarchShops are shuttered on an empty street in Venice on 9 MarchPeople keep a safe distance while lining up to enter a post office in Rome on 10 MarchA canal and the roads next to it are completely empty on 9 MarchA completely empty bridge in Venice on 9 MarchA canal pathway in Venice is empty after Italy was put on lockdownAn empty square in Venice on 9 MarchA nearly empty tram drives through Milan on 10 MarchAn empty bakery in Milan on 10 MarchAn empty street in Milan on 10 MarchThe Via Partenope in Naples is empty after Italy was put on lockdown on 10 March A waiter stands by empty tables outside a restaurant in St Mark\u0027s Square in Venice on 9 MarchEmpty stands during a football match between Sassuolo and Brescia at the Mapei stadium in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy on 9 MarchShops are shuttered on an empty street in Venice on 9 MarchPeople keep a safe distance while lining up to enter a post office in Rome on 10 MarchA canal and the roads next to it are completely empty on 9 MarchA completely empty bridge in Venice on 9 MarchA canal pathway in Venice is empty after Italy was put on lockdownAn empty square in Venice on 9 MarchA nearly empty tram drives through Milan on 10 MarchAn empty bakery in Milan on 10 MarchAn empty street in Milan on 10 March“Today’s order and new recommendations will reduce the number of people who develop severe illness and will help prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.“This is critically important for anyone with healthcare needs, not just those most vulnerable to serious illness from\u0026nbspCOVID-19.”\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown. It has cancelled most of its public events over the next month but said its rate-setting Governing Council meeting would go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The turmoil in global markets on Monday was deepened by\u0026nbspan all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which has led to stocks and oil prices tanking around the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are friendships which I know will continue beyond the confines of television.”It was reported last week (2 March) that Fielding was offered a £150,000 pay rise to convince him to stay on the show without Toksvig.Fielding previously expressed sadness over Toksvig’s departure, and admitted he now felt like “Tom without Jerry”.The Great Celebrity Bake Off, which returned last night (10 March), marks Toksvig’s final run on the series.Filming for the 11th series of Bake Off begins in the spring.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Similar lawsuits were filed in Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania.Legal battles over voter access in Michigan continue to this day. One current battle in the state focuses on Republican-backed measures restricting organisers from helping people fill in absentee ballots or using a vehicle to transport them to the polls unless they cannot walk.Another state that has spent years making it harder to vote is Wisconsin, another crucial 2020 battlefield. Starting in 2010 under Republican governor Scott Walker, Wisconsin not only passed tough voter ID laws but restricted early voting hours, gerrymandered district boundaries in favour of Republicans and made it harder to register to vote.As with similar moves in other states, the measures have been criticised for targeting groups that tend to cast Democratic votes. In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost the state to Mr Trump by only 22,748 votes — less than 1 per cent.However, in good news for Democrats, a recent effort that would have thrown nearly 300,000 people off the state’s voter rolls was recently overturned in the Wisconsin Appeals Court.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Texas, some voters were forced to wait in line for as long as five hours on Super Tuesday. Black and Latino neighbourhoods were disproportionately affected.\u0026nbspDemocrats fear Trump could win enough Latino support to win electionThis is part of a pattern that’s playing out across the country. Democrats have for years been trying to expand the pool of swing states to include former Republican strongholds like Texas, Arizona and even Georgia. They are doing this by appealing to and organising the demographics where they do best — in particular with young people and black and Latino voters.Texas, still run by Republicans at the state level, is just one of several states to have reduced the number of polling stations and introduced strict voter ID laws. These measures have proliferated since a 2013 Supreme Court decision struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to seek approval before changing their laws.Among the states to have taken advantage of their new freedoms following the decision are several Republican-governed southern states with many black voters who tilt towards the Democrats.One law in North Carolina, which has lately been considered a swing state, was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2017 after a federal appeals court described it as an effort to “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision”.Unless the Democrats can overcome voter suppression efforts that target these groups, they will struggle to get on the front foot again.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Do it again,” the prime minister said, as he broke into a laugh.The pair then demonstrated an elbow bump greeting before leaving the stage.On Tuesday, Dutch health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country had risen by 61 to 382, with four deaths reported.The mistake has shown the difficulty governments face with attempts to prevent outbreaks of the virus, formally known as Covid-19, which is believed to spread in a similar way to influenza.Last week, the World Health Organisation said it was understood that coronavirus spreads “via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick”.Health officials have advised people to wash their hands often with soap and water, avoid close contact with people who are unwell, and cover their mouth or nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughingsneezing to prevent the spread of the virus.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In January,\u0026nbsphe proposed changing the constitution that would limit the presidency to two terms overall. On face value, that created additional barriers to Mr Putin staying on —\u0026nbspthe solution favoured by most of Russia’s ruling class.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, parliamentarians offered a not-unexpected lifeline to their patron.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesValentina Tereshkova, a former cosmonaut and uber loyal deputy of the ruling party fraction in the State Duma, said changes should be dictated by the will of “the people.” But her opinion was clear: either the term limit should be removed, or reset for Mr Putin.\u0026nbspSpeaker Vyacheslav Volodin convened a 90 minute pause in the parliamentary sitting to “discuss” the proposals. A short while later Mr Putin made the short trip over from the Kremlin to give his reaction.\u0026nbspPutin has US \u0027exactly where he wants us\u0027, says key impeachment witnessTrump accused of threatening elections after interference warningAnyone near germaphobic Putin ‘temperature checked’ for coronavirusHe said he was open to the idea of a further two elections\u0026nbsp—\u0026nbspextending his tenure to his 80s, and comfortably past the previous record innings set by Joseph Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.\u0026nbsp“It’s a possible option in principle, but on one contrition: if the constitutional court decides that such an amendment will not contravene the constitution,” Mr Putin said. “We aren’t adopting a new constitution, but making significant amendments to it.”\u0026nbspUnder the proposals Mr Putin put forward, appointments to the constitutional court are to be made by the president himself. This is one of several areas that will see presidential power increased.\u0026nbspResetting presidential terms was seen by many experts as the most straightforward way for the president to get around his 2024 problem - but also the most cynical.\u0026nbspIn 2011, Russian public opinion reacted strongly against a similarly transparent manoeuvre. Mr Putin’s return to office in place of Dmitry Medvedev was met with massive street protests that at one point threatened to spiral out of control.\u0026nbspSpeaking at parliament, Mr Putin insisted his aim was to leave a democratic legacy. He would not support removing the term limit in entirety, for example.\u0026nbsp“If the country is to be dynamic, it needs its leaders to change,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Covid- crisis was born in Wuhan and raises red-flag warnings over the country’s future prosperity and stability.Coronavirus is no joke but I am glad to say the opportunity is all ours. It gives us cover to do things we might never have otherwise dared.New Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his first Budget on Wednesday to seize that chance with both hands.“We go into this in a very strong position,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “We need to make sure we respond at scale to whatever scenario comes our way.”This will be no “safety first” Budget. The coronavirus health emergency provides an option to be bold.It unlocks the Treasury stranglehold on spending, borrowing, infrastructure and, crucially, tax reform.Cash will be unleashed first into the NHS, with food and medical supplies a priority for the sick and elderly, plus emergency welfare for those whose earnings suddenly dry up.But there will also be money for big projects — schools, roads and railways and, with another deluge of rain on its way, a welcome doubling of spending on flood defences to £.BILLION.There will be both tax cuts and rises, but plans for a hike in fuel duty will be ditched, I gather.“Our public finances are in good shape,” the Chancellor insists. “I will lay the foundations for future growth and prosperity, level up the country and spread opportunity.”In other words, what is good for Britain’s physical health is also good for economic well-being.The way the world does business changed abruptly when Beijing celebrated Chinese New Year by shutting down most of the country.Today the “workshop of the world” is silent — with alarming implications for a regime whose authority depends on feeding nearly a fth of the planet’s population.Global giants including Volkswagen and Mercedes in Germany, and Apple in the USA, whose vital supply lines have been severed, are weighing their options.Thanks to Donald Trump’s trade wars, they were already reassessing their reliance on cheap but now unreliable overseas labour. The revival of “Rust Belt” cities and recruitment of local workers back home will accelerate.Others with no interest in capitalism are also finding opportunities.We may look back on those “before and after” satellite images of noxious nitrogen- dioxide clouds over China, and the clear blue skies today, as a turning point.Extinction Rebellion protesters might start digging up turf outside the Chinese Embassy, instead of vandalising Cambridge University.We will also notice a drop in air pollution after the collapse of shipping and plane travel.Ships carry  per cent of world trade but burn the heaviest oil, from the dirtiest dregs of a barrel of crude.Greta Thunberg and her “climate emergency” apostles will pounce on this evidence that we can live on fresh air.More seriously, we may be witnessing the end of globalisation — the spread of interlocking world trade which has raised living standards and spread prosperity for millions.It leaves Britain with the opportunity to pick up some of the slack.Ministers are already encouraging firms to raise productivity by swapping cheap migrant labour for expensive but efficient robot technology.The crisis will also have an impact on negotiations with the European Union.Britain is well placed, as a nimble sovereign nation with its own floating currency, to take advantage of fast-moving developments.We have low inflation, low unemployment, a near-record number in work and strong public finances.For the European Union, with its straitjacket single currency and paralysing regulation, the coronavirus crisis has no upside.Hundreds of firms and zombie banks are near collapse — including German giant Deutsche Bank. A downturn will hit firms and raise unemployment, already double the UK rate.EU negotiator Michel Barnier will soon have to choose — between the danger of a No Deal Brexit in December and the opportunity of a Canada-style arrangement which benefits all sides.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the happiest day collectively I remember experiencing in the UK since the  London Olympics.We backed Prince Harry in his ious good causes like the Invictus Games.And we saluted the daring approach Meghan was making to modernising the Royal Family. I welcomed her approach and had much excitement that she could finish what Princess Diana had started.But there was criticism too. And aside from the vile trolls in that cesspit otherwise known as social media, most of it was fair and balanced.Like, for example, the couple preaching about our carbon footprints and the need to change our behaviour, while taking four private jet flights in  days.They may not have liked it, but they clearly thought about those objections because the couple now claim they will do what they can to fly commercially.There were many objections from within the Royal Family about the couple’s behaviour and demands – and there are two sides to this story.Many courtiers will tell you Harry and Meghan were rude and didn’t respect the hierarchy and pecking order that’s essential for smooth royal operations.But those close to Harry and Meghan have a very dferent perspective. They’ve told me that the couple felt they were under attack by royal staff members and other households from day one.We worried about the obvious changes to Harry, who went from happy go lucky to angry and brittle.We also questioned why so many of Meghan’s old friends and family members – including her own father Thomas – were no longer in her le.From a personal perspective, I value my school friends and blood relatives more than anyone  because they’ve known me for so long and know how to bring me down to earth whenever that might be required.But those small criticisms pale into insignicance when you compare the column inches and media coverage devoted to the issues that Harry and Meghan care about.Watching Meghan on stage at Robert Clack School in Dagenham working the crowd of teenagers like a true Hollywood princess, it’s very obvious the Royal Family are about to lose a superstar – and no one is celebrating that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see this for myself in my home town of Margate, where the rows of boarded up shops in the centre create a mood of permanent despair.In fact, for all the recent talk of regeneration in the Kent coastal town, it remains in the top one per cent of most deprived neighbourhoods in England.In the wake of Coronavirus, the Chancellor this week must take steps to ensure that businesses can stillthrough the crisis.Among the measures he should consider is a temporary suspension in VAT or employers’ national insurance so firms don’t suddenly run out of cash.He might also introduce a scheme whereby tax payments could be spread out over a longer period.Butthe roots of a retail revival are to go deeper, then the Conservative government will have to embark on genuine reform of business rates, which are currently penalising too many retailers.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street. The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy,” says Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the retail chain Beales, which is now being closed with the loss of , jobs.As Mr Brown points out, in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was  times as much as the rent, an unsustainable position.In this second decade of the st century, the Government is meant to be encouraging enterprise, but this mismanaged, unjust system does the exact opposite.As the commercial equivalent of the council tax, the unorm business rate — which is set by central government but collected by local authorities — is a levy paid by companies, supposedly based on the notional rental value of the premises they occupy.But it has become badly distorted by continual tinkering and changes in retail practices.Ministers still like it because it brings in a large amount of revenue, over £billion-a-year, and it is dficult to avoid.But it is riddled with absurdities and inconsistencies.For a start, it bears no relationship to how a retail business is performing.As John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International global estate services company, puts it, “retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of UK business rate bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing.”In addition, it is a tax that punishes high street firms while favouring cyberspace and out-of-town operators with far cheaper premises.In a justiably angry recent outburst, James Daunt, the head of the Watersones book chain, complained that the business rates system is “hollowing out the high street” and shting work “to God-awful warehouses.In a classic example of this destructive bias, the business rates bill for Amazon in  was just £.million, despite UK sales of nearly £.billion.Yet the fashion chain Next, with  stores, had to pay a business rates bill almost £million more than Amazon.The trouble doesnt end there.Businesses with a property of a rateable value of less than £, are eligible for  per cent tax relief, whereas stores with a property value of over £, get no relief at all.In addition, firms can be hurt by transitional relief, which is meant to act like a shock-absorber in gradually phasing in changes in the size of tax bills after any revaluation of properties.Transitional relief might be beneficial when rental values are rising because it gives business ratepayers several years to adjust to increases.But since the last valuation in , retail firms increasingly inhabit a world where commercial rents are falling.Because transitional relief also slows down reductions in bills, this means that many businesses are now paying far more than they really should, given the lower values of their properties.In one branch of Poundland in Blackpool, for example, the business rate should have fallen by  per cent between  and  because of the drop in rental values.Instead, misnamed transitional relief means that by  it will have gone down in real terms by only  per cent.“Transitional relief  I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,” says Poundland’s boss Barry Williams.The Government has tinkered with business rates for years, but all this has achieved is more frustration and complexity.Real reform is needed so that the spirit of enterprise is rewarded rather than punished.Buoyed by their recent election result, the Tories talk about “levelling up the economy” through major infrastructure projects and new transport links.Butthey really want to make an immediate dference, they will focus on helping our high streets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On housing we have taken a step back, generationally.Whereas my family could be certain of a secure home with a rent we could afford, too many young people today will never know what a stable foundation like that can do for them.A proper home lets people get on with their lives, get their children into a good school, start a business, get involved in the community.These are great British traits that the Conservative Party should be fighting for every day. After all, we created Right To Buy, which has been a great source of stability and mobility for millions, and a triumph of Tory values.However, we now need to reorient the policy so the great opportunities we continue to offer to people with Right To Buy are more than matched by building new social housing to replace what we sell.This is importantwe want to give more people the same chance I had. Shelter recently found there was a net loss of , council houses last year as a result of demolitions and properties sold off through Right To Buy.This is happening while thousands of hard-working families sit on social housing waiting lists, desperate for a shot at the stability they cannot find anywhere .Runaway house prices mean owning your own home has become a distant dream for many lower-paid workers — receptionists, hospital porters, teaching assistants.These hard-working people still deserve a secure home. In the past  years alone house prices in England have grown at twice the pace of wages.The average home increased in value by  per cent between  and , while wages only grew by  per cent.Investing in social housing should be a deeply Conservative ideal. It gives people a  on which to build their lives, to progress and to grow. It is an essential element of a society that values social mobility.After all, it was a Conservative-led council in Liverpool that built the first ever council house as far back as .At last year’s General Election, people up and down the country, many from poorer backgrounds and living in social housing, put their trust in the Conservative Party to deliver for them.If our policies simply continue to provide only expensive new-builds for the already well-off, and almost unaffordable rents for the rest, then people might be left wonderingthat trust was misplaced.By building up our nation’s social housing and ensuring there is sufficient stock of affordable homes, we can give people a chance of a good home and deliver on our promises of fairness and aspiration.There is a world of dference between my childhood home and the grim high-rises that have come to define social housing for many today.But done right, new social housing can create thriving community hubs, minimise crime and be as appealing as new garden villages and towns. You need only to look at Goldsmith Street, the award-winning new development in Norwich, to know this vision is achievable.But warm words alone won’t build good-quality, affordable homes. We need money to build, and the Budget is a chance to signal the party is serious about tackling housing inequality head on.I’ve led a group of  fellow Conservative MPs from across the country and one Conservative metro mayor to call on the Chancellor to let our voters know whose side we are on. We have sent him a letter, an edited version of which is above.Many of us have felt the benefits of social housing in our own lives and we want the next generation to have the same shot at success we did. I hope our new Chancellor listens to our call in his Budget.A secure home lets people get on with their lives, look after their families and grow their businesses without having to worry about damp and draughts damaging their children’s health or a sudden hike in rent ending their dreams.Ensuring this means building up our nation’s offer of social homes. This has been ignored for too many decades. If our policies simply continue to provide only unaffordable housing, the people will never forgive us.However,we are the party that finally delivers the social and other high-quality affordable housing this country needs, they will never forget us.We need the money to build and renovate our available stock, and reform of the planning and laws around land to make it easier to get the social homes built.We believe this year’s Budget is the chance to signal that we will be serious about making this happen.Yours sincerely, DavidOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s been under Aprican rule ever since.”Immediate consequences seem to be a dramatic improvement in the weather, everyone in London is now dressed like Graham Norton and there’s a ban on black people and white people holding hands on buses.Love can breach the racial ide, though. Callum, a white nought, played by Jack Rowan, has fallen for Masali Baduza’s Sephy, the black daughter of the Home Secretary.This all plays well, obviously, to the self-loathing Empire guilt of the BBC and a lot of middle-class newspapers, who’ve described it as “timely”, “vital” and even claimed: “Noughts + Crosses’ world is our world.”I don’t know what part of Britain they live in where black and white people are banned from holding hands on buses but, lets set aside the show’s political agenda for a moment.The thing about Noughts + Crosses is that, for both technical and artistic reasons, it doesn’t work particularly well as a drama.The story is, of course, as solid as the day William Shakespeare wrote Romeo  Juliet, but the visual problems start with the fact that, because it was filmed in Cape Town, there appears to be a dirty great mountain hovering above what I think is meant to be Tilbury.The obvious climate issue also means poor Helen Baxendale, who plays Callum’s servant mum Maggie, is left with the gear change when she suddenly has to hold up her boss’s dress and say: “Beautul isn’t it . . . and so is the weather.”“Yes, finally some sunshine, You might even catch some colour.”Ker-unch. I’m also not buying the central relationship between Sephy and Callum, which is marked by a distinct lack of sexual chemistry, or the idea he qualied for the elite military school after one weekend on an assault course.The real issue you cannot ignore, however, is the political baggage. If Noughts + Crosses had been screened  or even  years ago, it would’ve been sensational.In , though, TV is overwhelmed by shows and voices telling us everything is racist and sexist, so it just felt and looked like the slowest-moving episode of Doctor Who ever.I find it particularly galling that a lot of those siren voices belong to journalists who I know will be out of a job the day they stop pretending modern-day Britain is really no dferent from Third Reich Germany in .It shouldn’t blind us to our own country’s faults, though.I can, for instance, think of a very prominent British institution that’s had nothing but white, male Director Generals since it was created in .The BBC, though, has always been better at pointing the finger at others rather than itself.So until such time as TV realises less is more, I fully expect Noughts + Crosses to be given awards, acclaim and further series, while a great chunk of television’s weary audience shrugs: “Yeah, everything is racist. We know.”THE heart now sinks every time the lt doors open at The Sex Clinic, on E, and out pops another human horror story like “fabulous fairy” Hugo.His description, not mine. And based on what  I’ve absolutely no idea.But apparently Hugo can have anything up to “three or four men a day”, while he describes his sex le as “very fast-forward”.So I took the hint and skipped through his bits at x speed.The trouble with The Sex Clinic, though, is there’s no light at the end of the tunnel – just more patients like free-wheeling Esther, from Wigan, who shocked me to the core by announcing: “I do not want to jump from d**k to d**k like Tarzan.”’Cos I’d no idea Tarzan was even gay.Although it’s Jane I actually feel sorry for, obviously.Beth England: “Getting on flights brought me back down to earth.”GOOD Morning Britain “megafauna” Piers Morgan: “A lot of people say I look like a young Roger Moore.”BBC continuity: “Now you’re in for a treat.

My three children Eddie, , Sammy, , and Annie, nine, do  hours a week of clubs between them, so I spend much of my week as an unpaid driver.With a full-time job and housework to do, a period of self-isolation doesn’t sound so bad.I isolate in Annie’s room. It has a TV, double bed and a desk. I grab my laptop, kettle, toaster, bread and butter, a huge bottle of water, teabags and Pot Noodles and arrange them on a bookcase.As I hear the car pull off outside, I lie down with the book I’ve been trying to finish since Christmas. My eyelids get heavy so I take a nap.The car ing wakes me up. I have a Pot Noodle for lunch and stick on Netflix I never watch.After the family brush their teeth that night I do mine — then I thoroughly clean the bathroom, as per the Government’s advice.That done, I opt for an early night.I WAKE up early and the sun is shining. Normally on a Sunday I would take the dogs for a walk. I’ve already tidied the room top to bottom.When I hear my husband, Jon, surface, I ask for a bowl of cereal. He brings me breakfast and we chat through the door as he makes notes on what to do for Sunday lunch.I amuse myself by doing a jigsaw, watching MasterChef and reading.Social media feels like my only link to the outside world. I find myself constantly looking for #Coronavirus and #Covid.With the kids in bed before school, I phone my mum before going to bed myself.I never struggle to sleep but after zero physical activity, when I lie down my mind whirs with the virus. I check the Government website again. No word on whether to send your kids to school.AFTER a restless night, I am up early with nothing to do and nowhere to go. I watch Sammy play football in the garden and wave as the family head down the driveway to school.I get three texts from the GP, each addressed to one of the kids, saying not to come to the surgerythey have flu-like symptoms but to call , stay indoors and avoid close contact with others.I ask Jon for a boiled egg then shower before cleaning the bathroom again, top to bottom.It has never been so clean.When there is a knock at the door, I go downstairs and try to communicate “self-isolation” to the delivery guy.But he needs a signature and leaves one of those “sorry you weren’t in” cards. I slam the bedroom door.Jon senses I’m in a foul mood so he suggests we eat dinner together — on opposite sides of the door.I DECIDE to do some research away from the internet and call a doctor friend who works at the local hospital.I am becoming increasingly concerned and it doesn’t help that I have only the four walls around me and my laptop. I know I should turn it off but the situation outside is developing so fast.As Jon puts down my lunch of a ham sandwich, I can tell by the slam of the plate he is getting as sick of the experiment as I am.He has done every school run, made every lunch, taken them to their clubs and cooked all of their dinners.I hear him telling them all to wash their hands when they come in from school and a chat with Annie through the door reveals there are hand sanitisers in every classroom and hallway at her school.That is a new development since the start of the week.I DO my usual check to see where the country is with the virus.Having time to think has changed my view. I felt my family were low-risk — we haven’t been to any of the international hotspots or, as far as we know, come into contact with anyone who has. Or have we The virus is spreading and until I have to isolate for real, I am not spending a second more away from my loved ones than I have to.I have reached the end of my experiment and while I did not experience loneliness, I have learned a lot about a virus that could kill millions globally.I will take the threat far more seriously now than I did before.We will not change how we live our lives but I have learned over the past five days that coronavirus isn’t simply something that happens to other people in big cities.It is just along the road from me and is probably moving closer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then whack in a global pandemic, wipe trillion off the stock market, tank the oil price and top it all off with a boss who wants you to pluck , nurses out of thin air.Welcome to Rishi Sunakaposs world. A world in which tourism has all but stopped, toilet roll has run out, and the Prime Minister is refusing to get himself tested for a killer bug on the basis that HE thinks heaposs fine. Boris Johnsonaposs relaxed attitude to the possibility of being infected by Nadine Dorries - and which of us havenapost wonderedsheaposd destroy us all one day  - raises two important questions.The first is thathe had to shut himself away from the world for a fortnight, whether it would make the tiniest dference to anyone except Carrie. And the other is whether it might have an impact on next yearaposs birth rate.  But Johnson has never set anyone much of an example, except of what not to do. And so far heaposs doing a marvellous job of showing us that coronavirus is a lot worse than just a cough. He was elected  months ago on the promise of new nurses, hospitals and police officers, investment in teachers and schools, road schemes, rail schemes, freeports and post-Brexit innovation. The wet winter added a few more billions of flood defences, grants and clean-up operations to the national wish-list, and now the Wu Flu is going to mop up all the billions he didnapost have in the first place. He always wanted to be PM, but on his terms. He did not notice that only a few PMs get to do what they promised, because events, dear boy, events.His pet chancellor could stand up today and promise us all free teabags for le. Itaposd be cheap, welcome, and encourage entrepreneurs. It still ainapost going to happen, just like most of what IS in the Budget. Rishi Sunak may promise sick pay for all, mortgage holidays, and short-term business loans, but it all has to be paid for. And there is no government that can fund a -month national economic shutdown. And that is what is being threatened -  weeks in which the disease will surge, peak, then fade. While coronavirus itself is eminently survivable for most of us, its financial impact will be felt by everyone. The first jobs to go will be at the firms already struggling. Then those with narrow profit margins. Eventually, the travel insurance claims made by iniduals will affect the underwriters which traded in a risk they could not predict, and then banks start to totter. Last time that happened, governments fell, mortgages foreclosed, suicide rates increased.  The virus is just the quake. There is no amount of aposfiscal headroomapos that can forestall the financial tidal wave that has already begun, and will inevitably hit our shores in the next  months. There will probably be a recession. Growth of the UK economy flatlined last quarter, andit remains stagnant weaposll be told, no doubt briskly, that itaposs a apostechnicalapos recession, it was to be expected, itaposll pass just like the cough. But eventhe UK discovered a coronavirus vaccine and was able to charge a million pounds per injection, its bills would never be paid. Because we cannot self-isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. In the US, people who can get the coronavirus test for free wonapost bother, because of the cost of a doctor. People with insurance have to pay , a head for the same test, so they wonapost bother either. The bug will take more victims, as a result.  In China, the worldaposs supply chains and commodities trading are already struggling. In the year to come, that will trickle through to new smartphones, Christmas toys, computers, machine parts. In the West some of the scariest debt is carried by car finance firms, offering customers a £, new car for small monthly payments and the change to sell it on after a few years. If used car prices fall, or debtors default, that market will collapse - taking with it demand, car factories, component manufacturers, and millions of car-building jobs worldwide. The only country likely to be insulated from a global crash is North Korea, whose economy has been self-isolating for  years. Its meagre finances may survive better than its malnourished population.  Sunak can rewrite the Toriesapos own spending rules, shuffle the budget headings and talk about how heaposll do whatever it takes to support the economy. But heaposs not in charge of the world. He is at its whim. And, for a short while, there will be chaos he cannot predict or compensate for. When people head back to work, its ripples will continue. The  crash had its roots a year earlier, with problems in the mortgage markets, and itaposs taken a decade for wages to recover. Coronavirusapos true impact will not be felt for years. Bless Rishi for trying. For saying the NHS will have all it needs, when what it needs is for the past decade not to have happened, and to get back the , beds it has shed since the late s. Itaposs not like he can buy it many new ventilators - every other nation on Earth will be trying to buy them, too.  There are some upsides to all of this, though. Firstly, the financial impact of coronavirus will combine with that of Brexit, neatly making both of them completely deniable, depending on whoaposs speaking. Leave or Remain, youaposll be able to blame the s***storm thataposs coming on the other team.And secondly, anyone facing election in the next year or so who has gone hard against the idea of free-to-access healthcare is going to get an absolute WHACKING at the polls."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus nadine dorries statement full","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Nadine Dorries statement in full as Tory Minister tests positive for bugNadine Dorries has confirmed she has coronavirus COVID- - making her the first UK MP to be diagnosed.

Nick Southam, , was munching on the healthy snack when he spotted a large mass on its side. When he cut it open, he said he was stunned when lethal Brazilian wandering spiders crawled out. The car engineer managed to get a photo of one of the spiders and posted it on iSpot, a website used to identy wildle. The results came back over the weekend and the spider was confirmed as a Brazilian wandering spider, also known as a Ctenidae. They are known for being aggressive thanks to the high toxicity of their bite, making it one of the most venomous in the world. Mr Southam, from Droitwich, Worcestershire, said: “Halfway through, I noticed a lump on the banana skin. “I cut the lump open after finishing it, and tiny spiders came out. It had small eggs on the side of the banana. “They were dozens of the tiny things but I didn’t know where they came from. They were not very active and they would not survive well in our climate. “There were only a few alive ones as most of the spiders were dead.”  The banana was one of four he bought loose from Lidl in Droitwich last Monday. The dad-of-two added: “It was only after I realised when I researched ‘spider in banana’ that this has happened before. “There have been a few incidents over the past few years of people finding spiders in banana skins. “I did some research and looked at photos of them when they’re grown. “I also found out they’re the deadliest spider in the world. I find it interestinga little scary.  Wandering spiders can grow up to cmin diameter from its leg span. They eat insects, other spiders and even small amphibians, reptiles and mice.

Abdir Addowsheikh, , paid for an extensive course of laser treatment to remove his facial hair so he would be spared the daily chore of having to shave. But the plan backfired during his third session at the Elite Laser Studio, in Islington, north London, in September  when his skin began to sizzle under the intense heat of the laser. By the time laser technician Anh Ngo responded to his complaints that the ray was too hot, he had suffered very signicant scarring and burning injuries. He also developed an infection, had to take antibiotics and was off work for three weeks, he told Judge Damien Lochrane at Central London County Court. After finding he received negligent treatment, the judge ordered Elite Laser Studio Ltd to pay the bus driver £, in compensation plus around another £, to cover his court costs. In the witness box, Mr Addowsheikh told the judge that he had felt like the laser was too hot from the start of the treatment, but had tried to tough it out. “The first time I told her it’s too hot, she answered that each session the temperature should be going up, he said. “I wasnapost expecting it to be so painful and so damaging. I was feeling very hot, I was sweating. “I tried to endure the pain but at last I couldnapost continue. It was too hot. “The way I felt was really really bad.  Despite Mr Addowsheikh complaining to the technician it was not until his skin “sizzled” that the treatment was halted, he said. He took three weeks off work following his ordeal and was left with discoloured skin around the neck and jaw line. The technician who carried out the laser treatment, Ms Ngo, denied all blame, insisting that the beam was only on Mr Addowsheikh’s face for a short time. It was she who called a halt to the treatment from the XLase Plus machine after her client began sweating intensely, she insisted. “On his skin I saw something I had never seen before and I immediately stopped and applied gel,” she told the judge. “He never told me to stop or that it was too hot otherwise I would have stopped way sooner. “He never told me it was too painful, it was me who initiated stopping the treatment. “I saw his forehead was sweating, but he said it’s okay, it’s okay.

Ada Quinn jetted off to Rome with family members, but shortly after arriving at The Crowne Plaza hotel in Rome they discovered the restrictions were in place. Annette Swinnerton, , from Tuebrook in Merseyside, was joined by her cousin Pauline, but is now anxious they wonapost be able to get back to the UK.She told the Liverpool Echo : We flew out yesterday because the Government hadn’t said not to.We made sure we had all the correct information. It was only later on once we had checked in to the hotel that we found out. We switched on the TV in the hotel room and saw that they had announced that the whole country was now on lockdown. They basically told us not to go out and you have to stay a metre away from people - which means we can’t really go down to the dining room as both my aunt and my cousin have underlying health conditions. They have shut down the spa and the swimming pool and everything. We’re stuck in our room at this point and we can’t do any of the things we had planned. We want to go home.  After yesterday’s announcement by the Italian Government, Annette and her companions are worried that their airline will cancel their flight back on Saturday, just as British Airways and RyanAir have recently announced their own flight cancellations. Annette said: There’s nobody at the hotel telling us anything and I haven’t been able to get through to Jetholidays. I know that we have been unlucky that we have travelled a couple of hours before any announcement was made by the Italian Government but our Government should have made a statement saying not to travel. We were not given any advice not to go so we have come on the holiday because of that.  Currently Annette and her Aunt and cousin have confined themselves to the hotel room while they wait for more information abouttheir flight home will be affected in the coming days.

Experts are warning the three signs to watch out for are: a cough, a high temperature, and shortness of breath. But the new findings suggest workmates, family-members and classmates could be at risk for a full working week - before a virus carrier was even aware they had the infection. The study says infected iniduals should expect to begin feeling unwell within  days - although in rare cases the incubation period can last longer, reports Devon Live. The findings support current recommendations introduced in countries including the UK to isolate those who may have been exposed to Covid- for  days.

Brits are being warned to avoid all but essential travel to the country, as the death toll climbs. Study senior author professor Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US, said: Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of  days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable.  But he added: With that period some cases would be missed over the long-term. The latest study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine - the most extensive of its kind - analysed  provinces, regions and countries outside Wuhan, China, where the disease emerged. It reviewed news reports, public health papers and press releases to estimate theof time from exposure to the onset of symptoms. The US team found information on  confirmed cases prior to  February where incubation windows could be identied - the time from exposure to symptom onset. They said: Most involved travel to or from Wuhan, China, the city at the centre of the epidemic, or exposure to iniduals who had been to Hubei, the province for which Wuhan is the capital.  This enabled them to estimate an average period of . days. Current understanding of this has been limited. Prof Lessler said: Human coronaviruses that cause common colds have mean illness-incubation periods of about three days. Almost allpatients appeared to develop symptoms within . days of infection. Prof Lessler said: These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, only  out of every , cases will develop symptoms after  days of active monitoring or quarantine, which supports current CDC recommendations. The US Centres for Disease Control and Preventionadvises active monitoring of people for  days after an assumed exposure to COVID-.  Many other authorities around the world - including Public Health England - have been using the same guide for those known to be at high risk of infection due to contact with patients or travel to a heavily affected area. The illness usually spreads through droplets of saliva or mucus carried in the air for up to six feet or so when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viral particles may be breathed in, land on surfaces that people touch or be transferred when shaking hands or sharing a drink with someone who has the virus. Often itaposs obviousa person is unwell. But there are cases where those who do not feel sick pass it on. Exactly how this happens - and how often - is not yet known.  Regular handwashing and avoiding touching your mouth, nose and eyes are likely to help stop the spread of the virus. Quarantines and travel restrictions are now in place in many counties - including the US. COVID- is largely a respiratory virus. Common symptoms include a fever, dry coughing and trouble breathing. But there have been some reports of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. In some cases it can cause pneumonia and potentially be le-threatening. Most people who get sick will recover from COVID-. Recovery time ies and, for people who are not severely ill, may be similar to the aftermath of flu. People with mild symptoms may recover within a few days. It may take weeks or even months for those who develop pneumonia. Prof Lessler added: An accurate estimate of the disease incubation period for a new virus makes it easier for epidemiologists to gauge the likely dynamics of the outbreak, and allows public health officials to design effective quarantine and other control measures.

Public Health England deputy medical director told  Sky News  this morning the UK must brace for the effects of a major outbreak. Dr Jenny Harries warned the fatality rate will rise, as the UKaposs death toll climbed to five yesterday.  She told Skyaposs Kay Burley Breakfast Show: We will have signicant numbers in a way which I think the country is not used to... so large numbers of the population will become infected. The important thing for us is to make sure that we manage those infections and make sure that those iniduals who are most affected so are elderly people particularly those with chronic underlying conditions get in touch and get treatment and we support other people in the home environment. Even mildly sick will soon be told to stay home Members of the public who show “even minor” signs of respiratory tract infections or a fever will soon be told to self-isolate in efforts to help contain the killer bug. The UK government’s chief medical adviser said the change in advice could happen within the next fortnight. Under a new approach, people will be asked to self-isolate for seven days after showing even mild symptoms, the UKaposs chief medical adviser Professor Chris Whitty said.  All intensive care patients will now be tested for the virus - as well as anyone in hospital with a respiratory infection. In a joint press conference with Prof Whitty in Downing Street, Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  also suggested the elderly and vulnerable could be asked to stay home in the near future, with further steps set out in the days and weeks ahead. He said that the more the peak of the spread could be delayed to summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage. The UK is currently in the first phase - containment - of the governmentaposs four-part plan. Coronavirus symptoms take five days to appear – the three signs to watch for People who catch the killer coronavirus are symptom-free for an average of five days - almost twice as long as the common cold, new research has found. Experts are warning the three signs to watch out for are: a cough, a high temperature, and shortness of breath. But the new findings suggest workmates, family-members and classmates could be at risk for a full working week - before a virus carrier was even aware they had the infection. The study says infected iniduals should expect to begin feeling unwell “within  days” - although in rare cases the incubation period can last longer. aposStart of UK peak of coronavirus epidemic expected within two weeksapos The start of the UK peak of the coroanvirus epidemic is expected within the next fortnight, England’s deputy chief medical officer has said. Dr Jenny Harries defended the Government’s decision to delay closing schools and the introduction of other stringent tactics, saying experts are assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a “balanced response”. But new measures - including those aimed at protecting the elderly and vulnerable - are expected shortly as cases rise more rapidly across the UK.

Our readers are quite rightly demanding to know what the Government and big organisations are doing. So here is our at-a-glance guide to the impact the crisis is having... and what might be coming next. Schools Heads are under pressure from health officials to stay open.Shutting schools would have a huge impact on parents, public services and thewider economy.China, where the outbreak started, took the drastic step of closing all schools and colleges. Italy, too, has closed schools and universities – and cancelled exams. Here, all efforts are being made to stick to the timetable for GSCEs and A-levels. Delaying A-levels in particular could have a big knock-on impact on university admissions. The Government says school closures are possible as part of “population distancing strategies” to slow the spread of the disease – although there are no immediate plans to do so. Hospitals Measures to limit the risk of face-to-face contact in GP surgeries and hospitals include using more phone appointments and video calls.NHS chiefs are trying to push the outbreak’s peak towards the summer, hoping the warm weather will lessen the impact and let hospitals recover from winter.But they have warned that dealing with urgent cases could mean other services being reduced temporarily. That could result in routine ops like hip replacements being cancelled to free up beds for Covid- victims. Public transport  Public Health England says there are currently no specic concerns about using public transport. Restrictions could be imposed but it might depend where you are. It could be tied in with advice for people to work from home where possible. Previous research suggested London Underground commuters are more at risk of catching respiratory illnesses. Transport for London has upped its cleaning of Tube trains and buses. And Network Rail says cleaning of “high-touch areas” in stations has been stepped up. The Government is not recommending staff on public transport wear face masks. But PHE says they should avoid close contact with anyone who may be infected. Mortgages  Royal Bank of Scotland has confirmed customers affected by coronavirus can defer mortgage or loan repayments for up to three months. Rival TSB is offering a mortgage holiday of up to two months and both are allowing savers with fixed rate accounts to get their money early without a penalty. Trade body UK Finance said all banks would consider loan and mortgage holidays, and increasing overdrafts, for those whose incomes take a hit from the outbreak. Stock market turbulence due to Covid- led to the black hole in UK company pension schemes ballooning from £billion to £bn last month. Airlines  British Airways has suspended all flights to Italy until April . Budget rival easyJet is doing the same, until April , and is operating “rescue flights” for passengers already there. Ryanair is halting services to and from Italy until April . Passengers on cancelled flights should be entitled to refunds. No-frills carrier Norwegian is preparing to cancel around , flights between mid-March and mid-June and temporarily laying off a “signicant” chunk of staff. Trade body Airports Council International said the outbreak was “turning into a shock of unprecedented proportions”. It fears passenger numbers through European airports could plunge by  million this year. If there is a rapid rise in Covid- cases here, other countries could advise against all but essential travel to the UK. Pubs and hotels  Advice to work from home has hit trade in city centre pubs, with the number of drinkers down up to % in some areas. UK Hospitality said “it’s assomebody flipped a switch”, with once buzzing bars now deserted. But while high street pubs suffer, locals are getting trade from remote workers who head to the corner boozer for a pint rather than travel to town. And bookings for events, conferences and hotel rooms have slumped by % for the next two to three weeks as people avoid large gatherings. Should the virus spread, pubs may be forced to impose a ft exclusion zone between drinkers and have last orders at pm. And there could be a ban on screening live sports to keep numbers down. Hotels are riding the storm but want emergency measures such as a VAT cut or a business rates holiday of up to six months for security. Care homes  As yet, just one care home has closed its doors to visitors. Sunningdale in Tamworth, Staffs, acted after a case of coronavirus was confirmed at a nearby school. Fears of a signicant number of workers having to self-isolate has led to talks between the Government and care home bosses over how they could fill the void. There are around . million carers in Britain and a major outbreak could put , in self-isolation. The Department of Health is looking into suggestions that background checks for workers who have close physical contact with vulnerable people be relaxed. This could extend to those who have left care work or retired being drafted back in without the usual y wait for approval. Care homes are already asking relatives to think twice about visiting and urging families to stay in touch with their loved ones by phone. But all visits could be bannedthe outbreak escalates. Supermarkets  Tesco has already imposed rationing on certain items, with shoppers limited to five packs of baked beans, pasta, longle milk, tinned veg and bleach. It is the only chain to ration food but rivals are restricting shoppers to how many toiletries they can buy. The Co-op has a limit of three on packs of loo rolls, hand sanitiser, antibacterial soap and hand and surface wipes. Aldi has clamped down on loo rolls, allowing one pack per person, and is also rationing hand sanitisers, as are Boots, Asda, Iceland and Waitrose. Morrisons is limiting us to six bottles of bleach and Sainsbury’s has a three-pack limit on soap, handwash and tissues.

The Church of England said communion would only be banned in areas where there were high cases of infection. Peace handshakes and the laying on of hands would also be suspended. All churches have been urged to install hand sanitisers. Synagogues have banned handshakes and kissing the holy book, and are asking worshippers to set up “telephone trees” to keep tabs on each other – with eight people phoning eight others and so on.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came face-to-face with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry publicly for the first time since the Sussexes announced their plans to quit the Royal Family. But Meghan and Harryaposs final outing - the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey - was reportedly marred by tensions behind the scenes. The couple were said to be upset and emotional after learning they couldnapost be part of the Queenaposs procession at the start of the service, instead being shown to their seats with the rest of the the guests. But in a bid to avoid any more drama, Prince William and Kate made a last minute change to try and ease the tension, reports the Daily Mail . The couple offered to join Meghan and Harry in skipping the procession, meaning they all waited for the service to start in their seats. The decision was only made on Sunday, after the order of services were printing - meaning they were incorrect. However their gesture reportedly didnapost work, and their meeting seemed slightly awkward as both couples took their seats.  The Sussexes arrived first and sat in the second row. The Cambridges were shortly behind them, but Meghan and Harry didnapost stand to greet them. Last year Meghan and Kate greeted each other with a kiss on each cheek, but they seemed more reserved yesterday. While it wouldnapost have been possible for them to kiss, the two couples exchanged only one or two words as they waited for the Queen and Prince Charles to arrive.  Meghan, who was already sitting down, can be seen saying hello and giving an awkward wave. Harry also says hello, but that was as far of their conversation went, with Harry turning to talk to his we. Sophie Wessex, who is sitting behind Kate, leaned forward to chat to the Duchess, while Harry and Meghan chatted to Prince Edward.

The opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to supporting vulnerable sectors and jobs during the Covid- outbreak, but also to kick-starting the economy when it’s over. In the face of a perfect storm of post-Brexit uncertainty, economic downturn and coronavirus, ministers have it in their power to avoid a tsunami of job losses on our high streets, in our struggling manufacturing industries and regional airports and their supply chains. Yet this government talks the talk of levelling up the regions of this country, but seems incapable of learning the lessons of past failure. It doesn’t walk the walk to preserve industries and protect local economies. Flybe’s collapse is testimony to government inaction to protect regional economies and seize opportunities. Rishi Sunak, working people need to hear measures from you to boost regional development, including house building, electric vehicle charging networks and battery production facilities, investment in skills, green technology and jobs. With our aviation and manufacturing sectors in crisis and thousands of jobs at stake, continued inaction simply isn’t an option. With the future of some regional airports now hanging by a thread, the fears of the industry’s workforce can be allayed with a delay in the payment of airline taxes and duties and the extension of loans to airlines and airports so they can retain staff and routes until bookings recover. There must also be subsidies for the key routes tied to long-term environmental commitments as part of an integrated, sustainable transport network.  What better way than to demonstrate the government’s commitment to building connectivity between far-flung parts of our nations and our metropolitan cities  For manufacturing, we desperately need intervention and investment in our infrastructure to revive the fortunes of our left-behind industrial heartlands – those very heartlands that voted for the Tories last December. Yet the long-awaited -year National Infrastructure Strategy with its £ billion of capital investment that was to be published alongside the Budget has been postponed.

The Cambridgesapos involvement came after , orders of service had already gone out clearly placing them in the main party and failed to ease any tensions, according to the newspaper. Kate appeared to give Harry and Meghan the cold shoulder on arrival, while the two princes hardly said a word to each other. The Sussexes did chat happily with Prince Edward, however, who was seated on the same row and Meghan curtseyed for the Queen and the Prince of Wales. But they departed clasping hands tightly and sped off to start their new lives with more independence from the Firm.  Buckingham Palace played down any question of tensions, saying there was no set format for the service and seating depends on how many royals attend. But didnapost address why William and Kate were initially billed to accompany the Queen at the front before opting to sit with Harry and Meghan prior to Her Majestyaposs arrival.

Alessi Bonari posted a photo of her face covered bruises across her forehead, cheeks, and on the bridge of her nose. They come from the protective mask she has to wear for hours at a time as she helps people suffering from the deadly disease. She writes: I am a nurse and right now I am facing this medical emergency. Iaposm afraid too, but not going to go shopping, Iaposm afraid to go to work. I am afraid because the mask may not adhere well to the face, or I may have accidentally touched myself with dirty gloves, or maybe the lenses do not completely cover my eyes and something may have passed. I am physically tired because the protective devices are bad, the lab coat makes me sweat and once dressed I can no longer go to the bathroom or drink for six hours. I am psychologically tired, and as are all my colleagues who have been in the same condition for weeks, but this will not prevent us from doing our job as we have always done. I will continue to take care of and take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job.  We young people are not immune to coronavirus, we too can get sick, or worse, we can get sick. I canapost afford the luxury of going back to my quarantined house, I have to go to work and do my part. You do yours, I ask you please. She also urges people to do everything they can the stop the spread of the virus, including staying at home. What I ask anyone who is reading this post is not to frustrate the effort we are making, to be selfless, to stay at home and thus protect those who are most fragile.  Her post has recived over k likes and hundreds of comments of people thanking her for her hard work. One said: Friend, you are an example for the country and humanity! Another said: Thanks Alessia. Great admiration for how you do your job. Thanks for all you do and the really important words you used. We are close to you. And a third said: You are part of the Italy we are all proud of.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Prince Harry openly discussed Megxit, le in the Royal Family and Donald Trump in a hoax phone call as two Russian men duped him into thinking they were Greta Thunberg and her dad. It was an embarrassing blow for the Duke of Sussex, , who, along with we Meghan Markle and baby son Archie, will officially quit their roles as senior royals at the end of March. In an astonishing recording, Harry spoke to the fake Greta about his uncle Prince Andrew, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his frequent flying, his belief that the world is run by some very sick people and his battle with the media.He was tricked by notorious Russian pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, who are reported to have called Harry on New Yearaposs Eve and January  while the Sussexes were staying in Canada. Kuznetsov and Stolyarov posted the recording on social media, providing more embarrassing headlines for a Royal Family in crisis.They posed as Swedish climate change activist Greta, , and her father Svante, the Sun reported.The hoaxersapos previous victims include music legend Elton John and US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The calls involving Harry emerged after he and Meghan attended their final royal engagement - Mondayaposs Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey in central London. Here are some of the highlights of the calls.Harry on quitting royal le The duke opened up to the fake Greta about his reasons for quitting senior royal le, saying he is withdrawing to protect my son. He told the Russians: “It’s, that’s probably a conversation for another time, there’s lots of layers to it and lots of pieces to the puzzle. “But sometimes the right decision isn’t always the easy one. “And this decision certainly wasn’t the easy one but it was the right decision for our family, the right decision to be able to protect my son.  “And I think there’s a hell of a lot of people around the world that can identy and respect us for putting our family first. “But, yeah, it’s a tricky one, but we will start a new le.” He also joked: “I can assure you, marrying a prince or princess is not all it’s made up to be.” aposNo one has stripped us of our titlesapos The fake Greta and Svante prodded Harry about reports that he and Meghan, , had been stripped of their royal titles. Harry replied: “No. Again, you mustn’t believe what you read, no one has stripped us of our titles. “Because of a technicality within the family,we are earning money separately from within the family structure, then we obviously have been asked not to use our titles in order to make money, which we would never do. “But the press managed to jump on that to make it look like we had been stripped.” Harry on Donald Trump  Harry was also pressed for his opinion on Donald Trump. During one call, he said: I think the mere fact that Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry is so big in America, he has blood on his hands. aposGretaapos told the duke that the US President had run away from her, referring to the time Trump refused to be pictured with the real activist. Harry told aposGretaapos: “What a surprise.  He told the aposteenapos that she would outsmart Trump in a conversation about climate change, but she should always meet him when the opportunity presents itself.Harry, who met Trump at an event in London after the president called Meghan nasty, said: “Whether you have an option to meet President Trump or an option to meet Boris Johnson, I think I would always.Harry on Prince Andrew  During one of the calls, the discussion moved to Prince Andrewaposs friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Harry said: “I have very little to say on that. “But whatever he has done or hasn’t done, is completely separate from me and my we. We operate in a way of inclusivity and we are focusing on community. And so we are completely separate from the majority of my family.” Harry on Boris Johnson  It appears Harry has a more favourable opinion of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He told the fake daughter and father: “I think he is a good man, so you are one of few people who can reach into his soul and get him to feel and believe in you. “But you have to understand that because he has been around for so long like all of these other people, they are already set in their ways. “They believe what they want to believe, they believe what they have been told. “What you are now saying to them is not only inconvenient but is completely against everything they have ever believed. “So that is what you’re up against, up against changing habits, as you know.” UK political system aposbrokenapos  Harry also weighed in on last Decemberaposs election, which gave the Prime Minister an overwhelming majority. He said: The fact that our choice was between those two iniduals in my mind, I think, probably creates more of an observation that the system itself might be broken. Thereaposs a lot that the leaders of today can learn and can listen to people like yourself. Harry on his future in private le The Duke of Sussex also opened up on his future and plans for his own projects. He said he and Meghan decided against starting their own foundation because we don’t think the world needs necessarily another foundation from us.  With a hell of a lot of money being passed around the world, Harry said they are taking some time to consider starting an organisation to bring people together. Harry on Greta Prince Harry gushed over the real Gretaaposs work during one of the phone calls and said extreme action was needed to combat climate change.He told the fake Greta: “I’ve spent many, many years being criticised by the media for doing all sorts of things and trying to change the way we think, and I can sympathise but at the same time applaud the work that all of you are doing because it’s not an easy time and the world is a troubled place and can be very easy to give up and I think what you guys are doing absolutely remarkable. “Unfortunately the world is being led by some very sick people, so people like yourselves and younger generation are the ones that are going to make all the dference.” Normal le aposbetter than royal leapos  The fake Svante askednormal le was worse than royal le. “You forget, I was in the military for ten years so I’m more normal than my family would like to believe. “But certainly being in a dferent position now gives us the ability to say things and do things that we might not have been able to do. “And seeing as everyone under the age of  or , seems to be carrying out an activist’s role, gives us the opportunity to try and make more of a dference without being criticised . Harry laughed as he replied: “Oh no, I think it’s much better. Harry on criticism over his private jet flights The duke dismissed criticism over his use of private jets. He said: Unfortunately, there is very few alternatives. We have to fly on commercial planes all over the world. Nowhere near as much as most people who do it for a night or weekends. Certainly for my family, to protect my family, from these people, as you can well understand.

Up to an inch of snow is due before the end of the week, while large swathes of the country are also being told to prepare for treacherous icy surfaces set to cause tricky driving first thing. Meanwhile, the second highest tides of the year is expected today, meaning some tidal flooding is on the cards, particularly in coastal areas.The Met Office has issued two yellow weather warnings for snow and ice on Wednesday and Thursday - with much of northern England, Scotland and Ireland affected.The warnings, in place from pm tonight until am on Thursday, may bring travel disruption with wintry showers expected to fall as sleet and snow even to low levels, the national forecaster warned on its website. Further rainfall will also mean wet surfaces with icy stretches expected to form leading to travel issues for those commuting to work on Thursday morning. Railways and roads are likely to be impacted and the Met Office is also warning people about the increased potential for slips and falls. Met Office meteorologist Clare Nasir warned Wednesday will be noticeably colder than yesterday, particularly away from the south where more cloud remains, as does a little rain. She said: Generally speaking, itaposs showers today and a strong wind.  The combination of wind, high tides - the second highest tides of the year - and low pressure sitting out towards the north Atlantic means some Brits could see coastal over-topping and even some tidal flooding, she continued. Though this will be confined to those in the north and west who are exposed to that breeze. Ms Nasir went on to say rain showers on Wednesday morning will be moving up towards the far north, where it will be met by snow above two to three hundred metres. Though, inland, including the Midlands, will see sunshine to start the day and the majority of the early patchy rain will clear for some brighter skies emerging as Wednesday progresses. However, the forecaster said into the afternoon further showers will develop and move inland, meaning no-one really is immune and could lead to coastal flooding.

Melissa Ryan claims she was pressured into getting her brows laminated by a member of staff who aposwasnapost fully qualiedapos - both of which the salon denies - after she had a lip filler treatment yesterday. She blasted Kent business Cavendish Aesthetics, saying aposshe could have done a better job blindfoldedapos.The owner of the parlour has hit back claiming she offered to thin her brows after the treatment, Kent Live reports, adding that she had been subjected to social media abuse following the complaint. The -year-old posted a description of her experience and a picture of her eyebrows on Facebook , with more than , people sharing her status.It has sparked hundreds of comments in response. But now the owner, Amanda Cavendish, has spoken out against the constant barrage of abuse she says she has received. The business owner, , claimed she has received more than  messages in the wake of the viral post. She even says she has reported the alleged harassment to the police, who have been contacted for comment. Part of Melissaaposs post read: Amanda has dealt with a situation highly unprofessionally. I had my lips done today, they were fine I couldn’t fault her on that. Then whilst having my lips done I was offered to have my eyebrows laminated and tinted, I felt a bit put on the spot as you do when people try to up sell, but askedthis treatment would suit me and both Amanda and her colleagueagreed I’d look great, so I agreed to have it.  My eyebrows were completely unsatisfactory and nothing like the photos that are advertised on social media. I was left looking like I complete fool. I probably could’ve done a better job myself blindfolded. I don’t like to publish my confidence issues to other people but I literally came home and cried, this has made me feel even worse about myself and my appearance. I was allowed to leave the shop with my eyebrows in the worst state possible, people in public were staring at me and laughing me, it was so embarrassing! About half an hour after leaving, Melissa decided to contact the salon to air her concerns, but claims she was dealt with completely unprofessionally. She initially askedwashing the tint off would ruin the whole lamination, to which Amanda replied, telling her to keep them dry for at least  hours. But after another hour, Melissa sent a series of messages, getting more and more concerned about her eyebrows. Amanda, who is qualied to level seven masters in aesthetics, eventually offered a refund, but said Melissa did not turn up at the salon to collect her £ and instead wanted the money via bank transfer. Melissa says this is because her journey cost from Orpington to Ashford would render this entirely redundant. Amanda told KentLive: “It’s not a good idea for me to be responding to bullying, hate speech vulgarity on social media but I do want to put my side across.  “I’ve had over  vile harassing, hateful things said about me. “Staff are worried that someone will come in and cause problems, I’ve had clients cancel today. “I donapost want to have anyone here put at risk. “My husband is in work in London worried sick. “And the police are now involved – all because one person complained.” Amanda says her regular clients have been quick to support the salon, which has three employees. She also said she wasnapost worried about the future of her business amid the social media uproar. “If you look, before the last few days, I do not have one bad review,” she added. “I’m very well known in Ashford and,anything, I hope this will raise my profile. “I donapost pressure anyone into doing anything in my salon and my clients will tell you that.”  Amanda says she clearly explained Melissaaposs treatment was being done by someone in training.

After the treatment was done, Amanda said she explained to her client how the staining of the skin was to be expected. She added: “I said the tint has stained your skin but thataposs normal, you have to keep them dry for  hours, after that you can wet your brows all that staining will come off. “I asked ‘are you happy with what we’ve done  Because I feel you need to have your brows thinned out in the arch area.’  “And she said she didn’t want any off because someone had over-plucked them previously. “We agreed on this but I did say, ‘next time you come back to us you need to think about having your brow arch shaped.’” Melissa said her skin had become irritated and itchy after the treatment and insisted in her post she should have been offered a patch test beforehand.

Kimberly Anne had been chatting with her latest match for an entire evening before arranging a date, and the pair even discussed how they were both aposlooking for someone specialapos. But their relationship was cut short when the legal professional made the shocking discovery that her would-be suitor was actually already engaged.The -year-old recognised him as a suggested friend on Facebook and said she was in aposcomplete shockapos that his profile clearly stated he was in a relationship, before she discovered his partner proclaiming their engagement last month too.Although the man claimed Kimberly had the aposwrong personapos, his incriminating arm tattoo convinced her that she had the right man. Despite fears of aposbreaking this womanaposs heartapos, Kimberlyaposs sense of sisterhood compelled her to break the news to his fiance and then expose the man she called a apospiece of garbageapos on Facebook. Kimberly, of Palm Beach County, Florida, said: My first emotion was just complete shock, I could not believe it - I was just flabbergasted. I wasnapost seriously emotionally invested yet, but I was angry on her behalf that he would do this to her. Kimberly confronted the man about her discovery but he responded with - aposwrong person honeyapos. She said: I looked again at his Facebook pictures and compared a tattoo on his arm to the pictures on his Tinder profile and it was the exact same tattoo, so I told him this. I just feltthe tables were turned I would want her [his fiance ] to tell me. I feel women have to support women in these situations - we have to have each otheraposs backs.

I felt so awful and partially responsible that I could potentially be breaking this womanaposs heart. I said do what you will with this information, I would want to knowit was me.  She just said apositaposs ok itaposs not your fault, thanksapos. I blocked him and unmatched with him on Tinder because I was afraid that there would be some sort of backlash - I didnapost want to be harassed by him. Kimberly has since heard nothing from the couple but believes they remain engaged as their relationship status and engagement post remain online. Kimberly said: Her response was so calm and minimal that I donapost knowshe was in shock or maybe this was something that had happened before and she wasnapost really surprised by it. Iaposm afraid that she has decided to forgive him, but thataposs her choicethataposs what she wanted to do. Personally I would have ended the engagement immediately, but maybe she was more understanding than I would have been.

For live updates on coronavirus, visit our blog  We arrived in Rome on Saturday morning and it’s beyond belief how quickly the virus has taken the city. On our first day, the Trevi fountain, though quieter than usual, was still awash with tourists taking selfies, and sellers touting ponchos for the thunderstorms. By Sunday, the mighty Colosseum has fallen to COVD- .  Tourists were told they could not enter the interior to contain the spread of the virus, and the Roman forum was snapped up tight.It felt like swimming the channel only to be turned away at Normandy. By Monday, the line for the basilica was still as impressive as ever, though the bag scanners sat hauntingly empty and the Sistine Chapel was closed too. Monday evening, the full lockdown came into place and overnight bustling Rome fell practically silent. Tuesday morning saw empty shelves in pharmacies and supermarkets, no masks no sanitiser and yellow chalk lines around check outs so you didn’t stand too close to the cashiers. The restaurants are where it’s felt most. Hosts are desperate to get you inside, lowering the cost of gourmet meals as a bargain.

He was among more than  patients who had been diagnosed and since gone on to recover - with all being discharged from a wing of Hubei Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital on Saturday. The pensioner managed a recovery despite suffering from underlying health conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, hypertension and heart failure. He was first admitted to hospital on February  and received a range of treatments from military doctors. Health officials across the world have warned the elderly, vulnerable and those with weaker immune systems are more at risk of contracting the virus and then going on to suffer complications. However, England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said the great majority  of older patients will survive. He said last week: Even in the most vulnerable, oldest groups, in a very stressed health service – which Hubei was at the point when most of the data came out – the great majority of people who caught this virus – and not everybody will – survived it. The great majority, over  per cent.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte this week extended self-isolation to the entire  million population with the mainland European countryaposs death toll at  of over , cases. Official advice states people must keep at least one metre away from anyone  at all times - outlined in a decree issued by the Governmentaposs special scientic committee on coronavirus. The unprecedented quarantine comes as the Italian premier described the outbreak as his nationaposs darkest hour and has prompted the British Government to steer clearpossible.Meanwhile, Sergio Brusin of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, warned Britain could be on a similar lockdown in as little as a fortnight unless ministers take drastic action - and soon.He has drawn strong comparisons between the UKaposs situation now and that of its European neighbours and says thousands of cases will come. The strict measures in Italy say people should only move around for reasons  of work, for health needs or for emergencies. Public transport will remain operational, but Conte told reporters he wanted as many people as possible to stay at home, while those who want to travel will need to fill in a document explaining their reasons for doing so and carry it with them. If they are found to have lied they face possible fines or jail terms. Though supermarkets can remain open at all times, but restaurants can only operate between am and pm as long as customers are kept a metre apart.  As a result, tourist hotspots including Milanaposs shopping centres were all but empty on Tuesday while the three-foot rule meant queues stretched into the streets outside shops as panic buyers attempted to stock up on essentials. Other Government advice brought about the new committee includes no more kissing, hugging or handshaking. According to reports, hospitals are becoming overwhelmed in northern Italy, the epicentre of the countryaposs initial outbreak, with medics having to sidetrack non-virus cases. British Airways and Jet both grounded all flights to Italy until at least April, while easyJet has halted most of its services to northern Italy until nearly May. Passengers, meanwhile, were flooding back into Britain from Italy yesterday without undergoing health checks and claiming they have not been given any information about self-isolation .Neapolitan Paolo Lauletta, , who drives a cab in Brighton, on landing at Gatwick said his flight was  percent full with the spread having left Italians very scared. “I don’t know about self-isolation, because I have only been in Italy for the last five days, he continued. “I wasn’t given any advice about self-isolating. My we is picking me up to take me back to Brighton. “We weren’t given any information on the plane or checked when we came off. Speaking on the BBCaposs soon-to-be-axed Victoria Derbyshire Show, Mr Brusin said the UK Government has mere days to do what is required to prevent deadly COVID- coronavirus taking a hold of Britain as it has in Italy.  He said: “If you don’t do anything then thousands of cases will come. The UK is in the same situation Italy was two weeks ago. Italian doctors are reported to be making comparisons to wartime triage medics having decide who lives and who dies as the number of beds available continues to dwindle. Retired doctors are being recalled in a bid to give the struggling health service a better chance of fighting the virus.

The scans show patches in the lungs and the expertsapos findings could lead to a quicker diagnosis and help to prevent infections. The first British person to catch the flu-like illness had previously told how it hit him like a train and left him suffocating and in blinding pain for weeks. Have you been diagnosed with coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story. CT scans of a -year-old woman who tested positive after visiting Wuhan, China - the initial epicentre of the global outbreak - show white patches in her lungs. The abnormalities are known as ground glass opacity, or fluid in the spaces in the lungs, and they were more pronounced in later scans. The woman was admitted to hospital after having a fever for a week, a cough, fatigue and chest congestion. She was diagnosed with severe Covid- pneumonia and treated with oxygen and antibiotics.  In another case, a -year-old man, who worked at the Wuhan seafood market where the virus was though to have been passed to humans, went to a hospital after suffering a high fever and cough for almost two weeks on December  last year. A chest CT scan showed similar patches and scans taken later showed how the opacities had spread. The man was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, but he died a week later. A -year-old woman from Sichuan Province in China was diagnosed after ing from Japan and developing a fever, cough and chest pain. There were extensive white patches in her chest scan and a reversed halo sign was observed in the left upper lobe, the medical journal Radiology reported.A recent study of more than , patients, published in Radiology, found that chest CT scans were better than lab testing at diagnosing coronavirus at an early stage. The researchers concluded that CT scans should be the primary screening method.  In the US, doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City were the first in America to analyse CT scans of Covid- sufferers. The doctors said they identied specic patterns in the lungs of dozens of patients who were hospitalised in China at the height of the epidemic there. The ground glass opacities, or patches, became more dense over time, and the patterns were similar to those found in patients who contracted SARS or MERS.The doctors found fully involved lung disease in  patients who had scans between six and  days after they reported symptoms. In the UK, six people have died after testing positive for coronavirus. All were aged over  and had underlying health conditions. At least  people have been diagnosed with the virus in Britain.

The clip, captured by a dash cam, shows a line of cars waiting in traffic in the left hand lane as another vehicle coming from the opposite direction waits to turn right into an adjacent road. As a white van stops to allow the black car to turn into the road, a cyclist flies past between the line of traffic and the curb, seemingly obscured from view for the turning car. The car cuts through the lane just as the cyclist reaches the junction and the two collide, sending the rider over the bonnet of the car and the bike flying into the air.The footage from Victoria, Australia, was uploaded to the Facebook page Dash Cam Owners Australia , where itaposs had over , views. More than , social media users took to the comments as the video ided opinion over whether it was the cyclist or driver who was at fault. One said: The driver of the turning car is definitely at fault here. However, and it kills me to say it, it would be very dficult for the driver to see the approaching cyclist. I would never ride through at that speed. But another replied to argue: And how exactly would you like the driver to see the cyclist who is moving at pace  Traffic stopped would suggest that there is a build up and caution should be exercised by EVERYBODY not just the driver who can’t see anything.apos  A second wrote: How can the car be expected to see the bike  Iaposm a cyclist and common sense would say thatthere is a tall van blocking an intersection I should be more cautious! A third suggested: In my opinion both are at fault. The car failed to give way to all oncoming traffic and the cyclist should have been able to see the car attempting to cross and should have slowed. ,,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/biffy-c-2.jpg ","title":"biffy clyro announce pj live gig as part of uk tour","story":"Scottish rock band Bfy Clyro are to perform at Aberdeen#s PJ Live as part of their new tour.The group will play the state-of-the-art arena on September .It will be their first full-scale UK tour since , with the band also lined up to perform at venues in London and Manchester.Louise Stewart, head of entertainment at PJ Live said: “We can’t wait to welcome Bfy back to Aberdeen, especially performing to a bigger crowd in our new venue.#We know they’ll be a huge hit as they always put on an incredible performance and production, we expect tickets to sell fast.” vw, px\"  The news follows the release of two songs from their new album, A Celebration of Endings.Fans who pre-order the album from https:bfyclyro.co acelebrationofendings by pm on March  will receive access to an exclusive pre-sale for tour tickets.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

And visually, perhaps its blueness: indigo lighting that makes a feature of the bar, those azure blue tiles bathed in turquoise light, and the leggy bar chairs all stop the interior looking humdrum.The menu here wakes up my jaded palate. So often you read a menu once, find nothing much that you fancy, then scrutinise it again, trying to make the best of a bad job. Not here. Actually therersquos competition dishes vie with one another. Fortunately itrsquos a small plates selection, so we are not too conflicted.We dip into a luxuriant chicken liver pateacute, puce pink and stf like thick whipped cream with just an undertone of sweet alcohol. It comes with toasted chunks of creditable sourdough from nearby Deanston bakery and its weight again in lsquotodayrsquos butterrsquo- with Spanish morcillaand crisp bacon beaten into it- which impregnates it with a smoky minerality. Alongside comes sweetly piquant pickled chilli, shallot, carrot, celery, and samphire. This assembly would make a nice lunch on its own, and itrsquos a steal for pound. Meanwhile, three little slow-cooked, golden-crusted beef nuggets strike a pose on their glass plate. Their rich veal jus glimmers as does the liquorice-black pool of sticky-sweet fermented black garlic aioli. Inside this delicate crust the meat comes away in tender shreds.: Zinfandel Gastro Bar, Nithsdale Road, Glasgow. Restaurant review by Ron MackennaAngularly cut caullower, roasted to just the right point where itrsquos definitely cooked, but not mushy, is distinguished from some wannabe Ottolenghi effort by its flavour-loaded smoked cheese velouteacute. A smidgen of date jam, a quivering confit egg yolk also make the brassica more unctuous, while a snowfall of crispy fried onions adds contrasting texture. How good is this lamb rump  Maybe at this time of year it almost qualies as hogget, meat from older, more mature sheep. Certainly its intrinsic flavour is there in force, and itrsquos so pink and dreamily tender. A star in and of itself, the lamb comes with salt-baked beetroot that taste exceptionally of themselves, amber-crusted potatoes- in a sort of pommes Anna treatment, only made with duck fat rather than butter- with smoked whipped feta, and a judicious amount of black olive crumb layering on salty savouriness. A phenomenal plateful for pound, substantial enough to be a main course, and given the high cost of lamb, a definite bargain.lsquoGelrsquo  That words usually worries me, but this pearly cod in its IPA batter that comes with a lemon rendition converts me to the G word itrsquos strikingly right with the deep-fried fish.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake. If you chose to count the rings yoursquod see how many years had gone into making a blaze that lasts only a few hours."},{"url":null,"title":"reckless-brexit-plans-the-elephant-room-says-snp","story":"Kirsty Blackman MP has warned that the Conservativesrsquo Brexit plans will leave families poorer and worse off, and push people towards hardship.She said the Tories were ldquowriting a blank cheque for their own self-interest by ignoring the views of those who did not vote for Brexit.:UK Governmentrsquos Brexit position dangerous, says Mike RussellSpeaking to The Herald, Blackman said: ldquoAs the UK government prepares to set out its Budget it cannot ignore the elephant in the room.

All of this raises signicant tax revenue, or should do.We should have moved on from the question of whether we can afford to be independent.Just to be clear, Irsquom not a member of any political party but view the creation of a small, more nimble, independent country as a matter of ongoing community development.John C Hutchison, Fort William.GORDON Taylor invites us to explain how an independent Scotland would defend itself without Trident. Perhaps he should direct his question to the many other small independent European nations who seem to be coping well enough in the same circumstances.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.MAY I reply to Gordon Taylor by pointing out that the NHS in Scotland compares well to that in England our AE services are the best performing in the UK, Scotland has the highest number of GPs per head of population in the UK, and our patient safety record is one of the best in the world.With regard to education, a record number of students enrolled at university in  , with record numbers from Scotlands most deprived areas, and the Education Maintenance Allowancehas been expanded in Scotland, while full-time college students here benefit from the highest bursary of anywhere in the UK.Regarding Trident, Scotland is a sitting duck precisely because we have Trident, and the pound billion to replace it would be better spent on better things.I note that Mr Taylor makes no mention of my point about Scotlands non-existent oil fund Norways oil fund is very much in existence and now tops more than  trillion kroner. Scotland is a country rich in natural resources, our tourist industry is booming, our food and drink industry is worth around poundbn per year, and I would suggest that it is not a matter of \"just how can we afford independence \" but that we cannot afford not to be independent.

Can I suggest a simpler, more democratic way  When the Scottish electorate elect a majority of SNP MPs to Westminster from Scottish seats, such as in ,  and , then that is the mandate for Scottish independence. No need then for a isive referendum, or a broken egg on a white shirt.Alec Oattes, Ayr.IT is one thing for people to disagree with a view, but quite another for them to misrepresent what someone has said. GR Weirclaims that I \"want to know why Scots donrsquot want to go back to direct rule\". My question was, rather, what benefits has devolved rule brought to Scotland rsquo Mr Weir does not answer that but instead proceeds to tell us how awful \"direct rule\" would be, citing examples in health and education. He appears unaware that these are areas that were under direct Scottish control for long before devolution.On the same subject, your correspondent Ruth Marr says we should examine \"what benefit the Westminster Parliament brings to Scots and ask, under the auspices of which parliament would we be charged pound per item for our medical prescriptions and up to pound, for our university education\". The answers are easy. For a start, here is someone  who is unaware that health and education were the responsibility of the Scottish Office in Edinburgh before devolution. Second, the Westminster Parliament has chosen to pay Scots almost pound, each more than the UK average in public spending every year which enables the Scottish government to offer certain benefits without charge. It is worth adding, thirdly, that, in England,  per cent of prescriptions are dispensed free of charge, while in Scotland thousands of well-qualied applicants are turned away every year from Scottish universities because of the tight cap on Scottish student numbers imposed as a result of lsquofreersquo tuition.It would be helpfulyour correspondents acquainted themselves with facts before rushing to criticise someone who proposed opening up discussion of an important issue.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.ONE thing is for sure and that is the coronavirus is unfortunately going global and according to Bloomberg Economics it could bring the world economy to a standstill and cost the global economy . trillion, causing huge strain on even the strongest economies.In the meantime the SNPrsquos Alex Neilstill clamour for another referendum and correspondents in this newspaper have suggested all sorts of shenanigans to find a way to justy another vote.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The slow progress on establishing basic connectivity for businesses and iniduals in the Northern Isles has been deeply frustrating. Concrete action to remedy this problem can only be a good thing.“This, however, is only the first step. I have been led to understand that the first upgrades to the network are to begin in the autumn, and we will be looking for swt action.”He continued: “With a plan in place and an agreement signed there can be no more excuses.

According to this report, in fact, Huawei is one of the companies that has benefitted.”Responding during the debate, Iain Duncan Smith MP said: “I think that’s shocking. I thinkthat is true it is an absolutely indictment and I do think the British Government has got to be speaking up more. It is shocking and it is time that we call it for what it is.”Summing up at the end of the debate, the minister for digital infrastructure, Matt Warman MP, said: #The UK has been vocal in drawing attention to the systematic violation of human rights of Uighur Muslims.

We would really like to be in a position where we could form a committee, officially start the association, and move forward in the best way possible for the future of football.”Developing Orkney as a county squad and an Island Games regular will take time, effort and commitment.Like many sports, women’s football is now putting the building blocks in place for a successful Games in , but early discussions are taking place in regards to sending a side to the  Games in Guernsey.Nicola Croy, who plays her football for Orkney Women’s, said: “The  Games will be an eye-opener. There’s a lot of great teams out there, so it will show Orkney how much we need to come together as an Island Games team and prepare ourselves for our home  Games.“Once this committee is set up, we can start with developing the county and Island Games team.”Among the positions to fill will be coach of the new county side, tasked with guiding the development of the team and leading the team to success.And in a bid to expand the playing pool even further, women who may not be playing league football currently are still encouraged to attend the meeting in April.Brown added: “There is a magnitude of abilities out there in Orkney and they’re maybe not playing.“Anybody that wants to get involved in any way, come along on April . It’s a fantastic opportunity for girls and Orkney in general.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes.

Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

That#s a higher risk environment.With outdoor events, the risks are less.There are only limited benefits to cancellations. We also have to weigh up the social and economic gains and losses.The Londonderry and Downpatrick St Patrick#s Day parades became the latest public events to fall victim to the coronavirus after they were cancelled yesterday.Dublin and Belfast#s parades were cancelled on Monday due to fears large-scale public gatherings could spread the virus.But the SSE Arena said all its events were currently going ahead as planned.Dr McBride said Northern Ireland was still in the containment phase of the virus. It#s important we do not move to the delay phase too early, he added. I don#t follow social media, but a lot of the coverage has been unhelpful and caused great concern. I would say don#t panic, prepare and don#t be alarmed. Be aware. We should not do things just because others are doing them.It#s dficult to say it#s a mistakeevents like St Patrick#s Day. I understand the dficulty in trying to look ahead, but we have to avoid a mass panic scenario. The decision does seem at odds with the advice from the Health Minister.Four new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Northern Ireland yesterday, taking the total to . To date,  tests have been carried out.None of the positive cases were community transmitted as all have been traced to contact with someone who had recently ed home from Italy.When we reach the community transmittance stage, we will reassess, but we#re not there yet, said Dr McBride.That means when we can#t trace contact to anyone who has been travelling. That#s when we can say the virus is out in the community.If we get this right, we have the capacity to reduce the number of people contracting the virus by %, so following the advice we have been issuing is vital.We are still likely to see an increase in the coming days and weeks, but what we want to do is manage the peak number of cases to minimise the pressure on the health service. We want to flatten that peak and move it away from the winter pressures.If we move too early, that will reduce the benefits. Social fatigue can set in and the ability to sustain the precautions may wane.We do anticipate increased numbers of cases over the next weeks and months.He added that no one in Northern Ireland had yet suffered from severe illness and people can be reassured that for the vast majority of people this is a mild to moderate illness.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus: Expert expects #thousands# more UK cases within fortnightThe start of the UK peak of the coronavirus epidemic is expected within the next fortnight, England#s deputy chief medical officer said yesterday as cases rose to  and a sixth death was announced. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is no longer day-by-day. Parents, teachers and students need to know that there is a solid plan in place. I would also like a helpline for schools beyond what is on the Public Health Authority.Two weeks ago, Italy had the same number of cases as the UK does now. We must use this time to get in front of this situation because we do not want to be in the same position as Italy in two weeks# time.In Co Armagh two schools on the same site, Newtownhamilton primary and high school, were shut after a student tested positive for the virus.The NASUWT, the largest teaching union here with around , members, and the Ulster Teachers Union are understood to be waiting on guidance from the Education Authority. The NASUWT#s website has added a page updating members who are infected and advice on school trips.It says: As cases occur, more people will be required to self-isolate. It is vital that staff follow the advice of the Government to prevent the spread.Where teachers are absent from work due to self-isolation, this should be considered a medical suspension rather than sick leave and full pay should apply. Absence should also be disregarded for absence management procedures.Schools should ensure that risk assessments for visits abroad are reviewed, taking into account not only the risk of infection, but also the risk of becoming stranded, should the situation deteriorate rapidly. Schools should liaise closely with tour operators in their decision-making process of whether to cancel any visits.SDLP education spokesman and West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan also asked for an action plan for schools.However, the Ulster Unionists# spokesman for health said there was no need for alarm.Robbie Butler MLA added: If the scientic advice changes, then we must react accordingly, but we must listen to what the medical and scientic experts are saying and take their advice.Belfast Related ContentGalleryCoronavirusCoronavirus: Economist warns of £k blow to Belfast over St Patrick#s shutdownCancelling Belfast#s St Patrick#s Day parade could cost the city#s economy around £, and affect staff numbers, an economist has said. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms Eastwood tweeted: Such sad news that my grand uncle, Barney Eastwood, has passed away. A giant of a man, passionate about sport, business, people and this place.An absolute gent who showcased the best of us and the best of what we could be.MLAs from across the political ide paid tribute to Mr Eastwood at Stormont yesterday.SDLP Lagan Valley MLA and former publican Pat Catney described the former boxing promoter as a beacon of light at a very dark time.Mr Catney said: I first met Barney in  when I ran the Liverpool Bar in Belfast docks.He would come in for a coffee and a chat with bookmaker Alfie McClean.I was a young man, trying to build his business, and Barney was well-established. He was very generous with his time and his advice. I always looked forward to his visits. Barney was a beacon of light at a very dark time in Northern Ireland.At the height of the Troubles, he created a stable of world-class boxers who beat the best in the world. That was no mean feat.He brought le and vibrancy to Belfast at a time when awful atrocities were occurring.Mr Catney added: We sold tickets in the Liverpool Bar for Barney#s fight nights in the Ulster Hall.

I remember sitting there in my front room, listening to the unassuming wisdom from this amazing man.He was spell-binding. I could have listened to him all night.Mr Nesbitt added: Barney was just an ordinary bloke but he was so driven. His gym was one of the most prestigious in the world.

The two claimants - Celine Murphy and Ciara Toner - said they attended medical appointments with Mr Cassidy because they could not get an appointment with their own GP.Mr Cassidy, a former doctor for the Tyrone senior Gaelic football team, was struck off the medical register by the High Court in  over failing to comply with conditions attached to his registration, including completing an alcohol awareness programme. The Dungannon doctor was also previously convicted at Newry Crown Court for two forgery offences. In June  he was found guilty in Newry of conspiring with others to attempt to doctor the will of a woman who left £.m.Catherine Haughey, who was a widow and childless, died in  at the age of . Concerns about her will were raised shortly after her death.Mr Cassidy received an -month prison sentence with three years suspended. A subsequent Medical Council inquiry found the former GP guilty of two counts of professional misconduct after he failed to declare to the council in May  that he had been convicted of drink-driving in Northern Ireland.In Dundalk Circuit Court it was heard that Peter Corbett, Christine Bradley, Celine Murphy and Ciara Toner brought personal injury claims after they were rear-ended by a Mr Gerard Bradley, who was travelling with a number of other passengers.The claimants said they were suffering from neck and shoulder pain. Two of the claimants - Celine Murphy and Ciara Toner - attended medical appointments with Mr Cassidy to have medical and legal reports prepared for their personal injury cases.The two other claimants - Peter Corbett and Christine Bradley - were referred by their solicitors firm, P Tiernan and Company, to a Dr Jeremy Johnson to have the same reports prepared.A total of nine personal injury claims were pursued by people in both vehicles, with four being heard in Dundalk Circuit Court.It transpired during cross-examination that some of the parties in the two vehicles were known to each another.A number of previous accidents involving the claimants were also disclosed during cross-examination. Three of the claimants involved could not describe the third-party vehicle, including the make, model or colour. Judge O#Malley Costello said that never in all of her days as a judge or a practitioner had she seen such a collective set of amnesia.She also noted how none of the claimants had attended appointments with their own GPs.She dismissed all four claims and awarded costs to Aviva, which insured the defendant and which was represented by Ennis and Associates solicitors. Rob Smyth, head of Aviva#s investigations unit, said the company would take all necessary steps to recover its costs. This was a costly waste of money and resources. This could be avoidedall key stakeholders carried out some basic due diligence enquiries to help determine on the veracity of the information being supplied by the claimants, he added.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowTributes to young Antrim farmer Ward Patterson after sudden deathMother of Padraig Fox dies from #broken heart# following killer#s #short sentence#Pensioner hospitalised after fall at Co Down churchCoronavirus: Belfast Halax call centre closed after staff member tests positive ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowTributes to young Antrim farmer Ward Patterson after sudden deathMother of Padraig Fox dies from #broken heart# following killer#s #short sentence#Pensioner hospitalised after fall at Co Down churchCoronavirus: Belfast Halax call centre closed after staff member tests positive ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s about having that option.“I think it’s a good thing and hopefully,we can get classes up and running, it’s something that could really take off.”Local MLA Kathleen McGurk has been supportive of the plan and is confident it will improve the area.She said: “Quite a few areas of Foreglen didn’t even have signage.“This will harmonise the whole area, get some nice new signs in and the residents were keen to get them in Irish as well.“It’s a small, close-knit community with a lot of Irish roots and the people would be keen.

Councillor for the area, Brenda Chivers, said that although the provision of a waste water plant was still an issue for the school development, she didn’t see it as ‘problematic’. She said: “I sincerely hope that work on the new school will commence as soon as possible. “I would praise all the good work of pupils, staff, parents and the Board of Governors for all their diligent work to date.”Local GAA side Limavady Wolfhounds have also been given the go-ahead to develop their existing provision on the Scroggy Road.The work will include a new grass pitch, G training area, ball catchers and a walking path around the complex. Committee member Declan Quigley and his company AQB Architectural Workshop were a driving force in the development.He said: “This involves the redevelopment of an empty field known to the club as the ‘hill field’. It lies to the rear of our existing main pitch.“We were facing the possibility of losing our existing training grounds at some point when the lease runs out and the parish kindly agreed to sell us the area required to build a second pitch.“Once that was put in place, a planning application was lodged for a second full-size grass pitch with floodlighting, fences, dugouts and ball catches.“We had enough ground to provide an underage G training pitch. It’s a half-size pitch which is also floodlit.“Looking towards giving back to the community and giving parents something to do while their kids are down at training, we developed the idea of a km walking loop.“It meanders around the existing pitch and will go around the proposed new phase development. It will have lighting on it so anyone can come and do walk when it suits them.“That was approved through council last week and the club would like to thank Causeway Coast and Glens council for the approval. “It leaves us in a position where we can develop that bit of ground and protect the club’s future, while maintaining a valuable youth link, which is very important in an urban setting.“We have five years to develop it from a planning point of view, but would like to get that process started immediately, or as soon as financially possible.”Cllr Chivers said the development would further improve the developments the club has made to date.She said: “This will signicantly enhance the excellent facilities that this far-seeing and dynamic club have provided to date.“I congratulate all the management, members, players and supporters on all their efforts.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Getting a renowned author to the school, and to get one such as Kelly is amazing.“Creativity is so important to students, and hopefully she will help inspire future young writers.”Describing how the students loved the many dferent formats the event took, the librarian continued: “The circus theme of the talk went down a storm. Students loved the real or fake freak show characters, with lots of gasps and laughs.“The hall fell wonderfully silent as Kelly read aloud from her book, leaving the pupils wanting more.“And, more important, she was happy to answer all the students questions and received a rapturous applause at the end.”Kelly McCaughrain was last year’s recipient of Children’s Books Ireland Book of the Year, the Eilis Dillon and Children’s Choice Awards  winner for her ‘Flying Tips for Flightless Birds’ novel.The author said she enjoyed her first journey to the north west.“I’m grateful to Mairead for asking me along here today and hope the students got as much fun and learning out of it as I did. “This is one of eight visits to schools across Northern Ireland over this week and it was lovely to visit Oakgrove Integrated College. Indeed, I hope to be asked back again in the not too distant future.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Amongst them, one person beamed you should write I couldn’t see anyone there!’, laughing like he had pulled a joke out of the Billy Connolly catalogue. So firstly, I want to assure you I won’t be taking that route. So,you are looking for a pun or two, you won’t be able to see any he... - dammit, let’s move on.The Invisible Man is a continuation of Hollywood’s new found love for reboots, with the classic novel by HG Wells first brought to the big screen back in , and this time we have Australian director Leigh Whannell taking the reins to give it a more modern touch.Whanell, who is attached to previous horror thriller block- busters such as Saw and Insidious as a writer, is well experienced in the genre, and from minute one, you know the film is in very good hands.The film tells the story of Cecilia, played by Elisabeth Moss.We are thrown straight into her unhappy world in an opening sequence that absolutely sets the tone for what is to come in terms of sheer tension.Cecilia has drugged her boyfriend Adrianinto a deep sleep in the early hours of the morning, and immediately sets about the process of getting the hell out of there.Which wouldnt be too dficult in a normal house, but a normal house it is not.She has to tread a gadget world obstacle course featuring security alarms, passwords and cameras in what I can only describe is a setting you would see in a Mission Impossible meets  type of film.Because it turns out, her boyfriend is a genius millionaire scientist control freak who has taken every precaution in an attempt to keep her in his clutches.After narrowly making her escape thanks to her sister Emily, Cecilia finally has some sort of freedom, but matters soon take a very strange turn. Shortly afterwards she is delivered the news that Adrian has killed himself by his lawyer brother, and that he has also left  million of his vast fortune to her. So hey, it’s not all bad.Except it is it’s very bad.Just when Cecilia believes her le is becoming a little bit rosier, events begin to spiral out of control in quite sinister ways. The oven suddenly goes on fire, her blanket is tossed around her bedroom, and she too ends up drugged. Adrian still very much has a pulse, and through his scientic and technical wizardy, he’s only gone and made himself invisible in a bid to make his ex’s le a living hell, with very tricks more brutal than the last. A new tinder account and going back on the market would have been less hassle, but, what do I know Now on paper, it all sounds a bit over the top, and in the hands of a lesser film maker I may have headed for the exit early.But this film delivers, for two reasons.Firstly, Whanell’s direction is flawless. He burrows into the quite effective horror trope of less is more, not resorting at all to endless jump scares that we see too often nowadays.His camera work excels in making the viewer completely uneasy throughout. There is one sequence where the camera is simply moving slowly from left to right while Cecila wanders the house alone during the night. Whanell plays with the audience superbly. He knows he has us in the palm of his hand. Where is Adrian  What will he do next Now in a role that requires the lead to portray terror, paranoia, rejection and abuse, Elisabeth Moss is outstanding.This is a film with very strong themes in some quarters it has been called the first big film of the #metoo movement in its representation of domestic abuse, and there is certainly symbols of that at dferent stages, with Moss carrying the flame in fine fashion as she attempts to defeat her own predator.She is utterly convincing in her despair as her world begins to fall apart from all angles, including one horrying turn of events that will have your jaw almost touching the floor - you have been warned. She shows all her acting props that were also on display in the hugely popular Handmaids Tale series.So,you’re a weirdo like myself and enjoy being disturbed and uncomfortable for two hours or so, then ‘The Invisible Man’ will be money well spent.Hey, we might even get a sequel, although, given the films climax, ‘I canny see that’ happening.I’ll stop now.The Invisible Man is now showing at Brunswick Moviebowl. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As I said there’s no easy matches in the league and the sooner we realise that, the better.”McChrystal made his first start of the season at the RSC and was arguably the only City player to leave the pitch with his head high, but that is of no consolation to the -year old, who believes the visitors did not appear for the second half.“I don’t think we performed the way we can and obviously the manner of the two goals, one right before half-time and the other right before the final whistle, isn’t what we wanted,” he added.“It’s always going to be tough and you have to roll your sleeves up and do all the dirty parts of the game and then hopefully you can open things up in the final third as the game progressives and then maybe create something and get a goal, which we did, but their goal right before half-time, killed us.“In saying that it was only - and we were still in the game we had to come out in the second half try to go again and look to create the chances, but as I don’t think we did that tonight and probably got what we deserved in the end.” googletag.cmd.push Far from convincingAs an attacking threat, City have been far from convincing this season so far, with just four goals in four games.

At , the long-time proprietor of a Pennyburn sports shop is a le-affirming example to others of how to live a meaningful le after sporting retirement, thanks to the enduring power of friendship.  He pulls up the metal shutters of the shop and fights with the key as it struggles to unlock the door.It’s a short trip from home to his premises in Pennyburn but it’s a well-trodden path for a man now in his s.With a local paper snuggly secured under his armpit he’s made this journey in rain, hail and shine. Through good times and bad.It’s the same old routine every morning, one well-rehearsed over  years of business. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Jobby’s Sports Centre opened in the late s after he bought it from his friend Raymond Daly. I was entering a business I knew something about,’ Jobby says now. Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

LONGHOUSE POET  could be the one to chase him home at a nice price. He has some nice form in the book having finished just seven s behind Envoi Allen in Naas in January and just two s behind Albert Bartlett favourite Latest Exhibition next time out at Leopardstown. He improved between those runs, evidenced by his reversal of form with Elixir DAnaiy in those two starts. He was just over three s behind that rival at Naas but a similar distance ahead of him at Leopardstown. He can continue that upward curve here. Hell act on the ground and should stay out the trip on the testing ground. googletag.cmd.push : - ALLAHO  gets the vote here after improving massively from his first to second chase start this winter. On his debut over fences, he was just over abehind stablemate Easy Game but improved and looked a real prospect in beating Milan Native by  s at Fairyhouse in January. The fact that Paul Townend will be on his back on Wednesday suggests hes outperforming Easy Game at home and will carry Willie Mullins main hope in this race. He also has Cheltenham form, albeit over hurdles, having been third behind the re-opposing Minella Indo in last years Albert Bartlett. He looks a natural chaser and will handle the testing ground very well. It may be an omen that he was sired by a horse called No Risk At All. Heres hoping! googletag.cmd.push : - There are a couple of improvers here well ahead of the handicapper but my slight preference is for ALFA MIX  over Stratum. JP McManus loves Cheltenham winners and it could be signicant that he purchased Alfa Mix between his last run and today. On that last run at Navan, he travelled like a dream and ranged up before a mistake two out halted his chances of beating the top weight here today, Kilfenora. Gavin Cromwell trains this one and has his horses in brilliant form. He was third in the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday with Darver Star and could get into the winners enclosure with this one. He beat a number of these rivals on his previous run, also at Navan, where the likes of Cracking Smart and Top Moon were behind him. That was admittedly off a low weight but hes been given a chance by the handicapper and has been put away since January for this race. Hell travel better than most and with some luck in running, hell be coming up the hill in front. : - With Altior and Chacun Pour Soi withdrawn, this race looks a penalty kick for Defi Du Seuil. What promised to be the race of the week has broken up but there could be some value in finding the horse to chase Defi home. The forecast market could offer the most value here with Defi Du Seuil almost guaranteed victoryhe stays on his feet. The DEFI DU SEUIL POLITOLOGUE forecast is good value at  . It would see Politologue chasing home Defi for the second time this season having finished second in a Grade  at the course in November. He was also a game second to Altior in last years Queen Mother Champion Chase so clearly likes the track. Dynamite Dollars is the bit of an unknown here but I like a proven horse at Cheltenham and thats why Politologue gets the vote. : - I hope Im wrong but I think Tiger Roll will be beaten here by a horse called EASYSLAND . He is a cross country specialist and while Tiger Roll was a - winner in this last year, there was nothing as good as this French import in the line-up. Easysland is unbeaten over the ditches in six starts, mostly in France, but prepped for this by travelling to Cheltenham and winning the cross country last December. He made two mistakes late that day but still stayed on to win by seven, beating some of these on the day. Hell be ridden prominently so as to stay out of trouble and could upset the favourite backers. Tiger Roll has bigger fish to fry in the Grand National next month. He hasnt had as smooth a preparation this year for this pitstop and could go down to a second defeat of the season. : - I wouldnt have a strong opinion on this but TRONADOR  is interesting for Gordon Elliott. He has twice won this race with big price winners, including Veneer of Charm who won at   in . Tronador has been tucked away for this race and will go off a nice handy weight with a top jockey in Denis ORegan on board. This horse has also got a few mentions in Cheltenham previews, including from Gordon Elliott himself. This could be a gamble on track on the day, although the preference of his stablemate Aramax in the field might keep him at a nice eachway price. : - Appreciate Itis the talking horse for Willie Mullins in this but its a race that has thrown up a couple of shocking results in recent years. I was taken with DARLING DAUGHTER  when she won unexpectedly at odds of   at Leopardstown last month. She tracked the leaders in a nice spot that day and found plenty when asked to go for home two furlongs out by Lisa ONeill. She beat Politesse that day with that rival franking the form by beating Watergate Lady by five s at Thurles a couple of weeks later. The latter has decent form tied in with Appreciate It and Asterion Forlonge who was fourth in the Supreme on Tuesday. That gives Darling Daughter a chance and her mares allowance will go a long way on testing ground. She could run a big race at a big price.

I know Derry bands have been there in the intervening years when it has become a showbiz show-off party for the desperately cool kids out there and band managers desperate to be taken seriously.It’s not a music festival in the traditional sense where you go and watch bands and enjoy yourself it’s a bit like the Output Festival in Belfast, which is what I imagine hell is going to be like, except on a much bigger scale.Think of someone in your dream job telling you how they’ve made it, so they’ll be there forever, and you know what I mean.This Friday, March , until Sunday the nd,atAustin Convention Centre, Austin, Texas, United Statesthe gloriously great bands and the good at getting attention for themselves rather than their bands will be out in force.It doesn’t matterthese bands don’t do anything other than support other bands —you say you’ve been to South By South West , then that should be enough to get taken seriously for a little while longer.Paddy went at the right time andEoin O’Callaghanadded to the sentiment saying he’s “delighted to see what all the fuss is about. It’s a coming together of all that is relevant — apparently — so we’ll be there”. In Eoin’s defence he and Ryan Vail have been out touring the planet with their Borders album and really do deserve the acknowledgement.Between them, this is their seventh album and very few local acts can say they’ve achieved what they have. Following their win at the Northern Ireland Music Prize last November among numerous other accolades and even a BBC documentary, Ryan Vail said: “South by South West has been one of the most important music industry events in the world. To be part of it this year feels great.”Eventhis is just a bunch of industry suits patting each other on the back then at least there’s a couple of fellas from Derry in the middle of them and justiably so, there will undoubtedly be acts in among them who haven’t had one album out and still have a heap of their singles stashed away somewhere.To be fair the slackers will inherit the earth.Also heading over areThe Wood Burning Savages,who used to be from Derry, but we still love them.Lead singer and guitaristPaul Connollytold me: “It’s a coup for a band from here to be invited, it’s the world’s largest international get together of musicians, producers, venues, festivals and the chances of falling in with the right people are quite high. “We’ve put in a lot of groundwork ahead of it and our previous tours and festival appearances have linked us up with some fantastic people who want to championTWBSin the US. We’re just looking forward to playing our shows, trying out some new songs as well as eating some hot wings and drinking a few cold beers with new friends too. Derry’s legendary Hammond organ player,Caolan McLaughlinis going to be out there with us too as luck would have it, so the craic will be mighty!”Out of curiosity,what have they got coming up “We’re currently working on our second album and experimenting with a lot of new sounds. We’ve also just been invited on tour with our buddies Ash, as they celebrate their th anniversary.” Twenty-five years: they’ve come a long way since battles of the bands in the Argyle and summer days in the Gasyard. Hands up who feels old Elliot Finlaywas the only other Savage to get back, adding: “We’re excited to have the opportunity to go over and play in the States and, hopefully, get a few more people over there to take notice of the good things that are happening in the Northern Ireland music scene at the minute.”Just while I’m on the subject, anyone remember the line “I’ve never been to America, but I’ve been in some states with you ”At least this year the bands representing the parish will have something to justy their being there. I’m sure Paddy Lynch will be there in spirit. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tickets for Horslips concert at St Columbs Hall on Saturday, March , sold out quickly.However another gig has been arranged for the following night and some tickets are still available for this.The weekend gigs will be a welcometo Derry for Horslips.When Barry, Johnny, Jim and Ray take the stage in St Columb’s Hall they will play the songs that gave them iconic status back in the ’s.“St Columb’s has huge signicance for us,” says flautist and keyboard player Jim Lockhart.“We played here a number of times in the turbulent seventies and the gigs were always intense, with audiences that really rocked. But it has a more recent importance in our story. You could call it crucial.”Guitarist Johnny Fean takes up the story.“We’d been off the road for  years and as far as anyone knew, that was that.“But Derryman Jim Nelis, joined by two friends, Paul Callaghan and Stephen Ferris, designed and curated an exhibition in the Orchard Gallery.“We agreed to come up and open it. And we got up on stage again to sing a couple of songs and liked it so much, we got back together: and we’ve been on the road ever since.”The last word is with Jim Lockhart.“We’re really looking forward to these very special gigs on what will be our th anniversary year.”As part of the concerts, a donation will be made by the band and promoter to local disability organisation Destined who provide a range of support services for people with learning disabilities.Destined is based at a new centre at Foyle Road which was recently damaged in an arson attack. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

Exhaustion is seeping from my limbs like slurry leaking from a tank.By The NewsroomWednesday, th March , : am\"\"Two planes racing high in the skyMy we is working late so I’ve got parental control. The school run. Feeding, dressing, washing, homework. Keeping my son entertained. Stories, dancing, games, wrestling, singing, reading. His constant need for stimulation burning my energy until all that’s left is a thin line of hazy black smoke.We’re in bed, covers pulled up tight to our chins. I’ve just finished the bedtime story and I haven’t got enough energy left to move him into his own room.I’m probably closer to sleep than him. He’s still talking, incessantly asking questions. Always the questions. He keeps looking over to seemy eyes are still open. They are, just. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Eventually he settles, slowing down like the toy from last Christmas when the batteries begin to fail. His little body begins to unwind and soften. He’s been silent for a while so I assume he’s gone. But then.‘Daddy ’ his voice heavy and slow with the immediacy of sleep.‘Yes son ’‘What will we dream about tonight daddy ’It’s a ritual of his. Usually the last question of the day. Some infantile notion that his dreams can be controlled. That our stories are of our own choosing. It gives him some comfort. I’m spent. I don’t have much more creativity to give. I force myself to think of something.‘Why don’t we dream that we’re two planes racing high up in the sky,’ I whisper.There’s a short silence, ashe’s pondering the notion. His answer is barely audible.‘OK daddy.’And then he’s gone. His eyes have become dark rings. Sometimes he emits soft groans, sometimes he grinds his teeth. His mouth slightly open, yellow skin. The slightest discolouration where the vein runs along the temple. I move the back of my hand along his face, old skin against young. Rough touching smooth.Despite my extreme state of tiredness I don’t feel that I can settle. I try to read a book but the words on the page seem stale. I put it down and just lie there. Watching my son.I notice some animation enter his body. He turns in his sleep. Sometimes he reaches for me with his hand or foot, asto check I’m still there. There’s the occasional strangled giggle or whine. I know that something’s going on in his brain and I’d love to be able to read him now. It occurs to me that this sums up parenting, trying to understand what’s going on in his head.I imagine some sort of disparate narrative is probably being pulled together within him as a dream. Something which makes sense to only him, and even then only at this moment. He most likely won’t remember it in the morning. It’s probably already gone forever. Dreams can’t be captured like butterflies.When he’s awake he talks often about dreams, the fleeting scraps he remembers. The ideas that fill his head through the day. He often gives us a small glimpse of the scope of his imagination. The ideas, conundrums, concerns, questions, concepts. He talks about the future too, Recently he asked us ‘When I’m a daddy, who will be the mummy ’He’s chosen his career already. He says he wants to be a doctor and a scientist. It’s noble and serious. Maybe he will. Maybe he’ll change his mind dozens of times.But tonight my mind is tired from wondering and wandering. I settle down, letting the first stages of sleep caress me.It’s been years since I’ve remembered any of my dreams. Perhaps my mind just doesn’t work that way anymore. I get little hints occasionally, a teasing feeling or emotion, but I can never put the mirror back together.My brain feels worn, broken down, empty. I suppose there was a time when I had the energy to grow ideas and to order them. Now I just look at my son. When he sleeps. When he watches the TV, chewing slowly on a biscuit. When he’s with his friends, his face flushed with joy. I’m content that he is the realisation of my ambitions. The stick that all of my dreams would be measured against. We both sleep well.The morning is welcome and everything seems to work. My we is back home and my son is excitedly telling her all his adventures from the day before. The games, the dancing, the dream about the two planes racing high up in the sky.It’s a school and work day which brings its own feeling of urgency, a sense that things have to be done. But it’s also Friday and the sweetness of the weekend and the time together is close, reflecting onto all of us.I hurriedly get my son into his unorm and coat and he doesn’t really bother to complain. I brush his hair and clean his face. I take him outside, it’s definitely still winter but the weather seems more benign this morning. I’m fiddling with the straps of the car seat when he lets out an excited yell.‘Look daddy! Look in the sky!’I gaze upwards. There’s a flinty blue horizon and the beginning of a sunrise over the roofs of the distant houses, just a promise at this hour. And above, two clear lines cut across the sky like the silvery trails of flat slugs. They are parallel, even, moving away. At the edge of the contrails I can just about make out two aircraft that appear tinier than toys.My son is jumping up and down.‘Daddy, it’s our dream! It’s our dream! Two planes racing high up in the sky!’I lt him into his chair, checking the straps are secure. He’s still straining his neck to watch the distant planes. I warm the car and slowly reverse it down the driveway.‘You see daddy, I told you, dreams do come true.’‘You’re right son. You’re absolutely right.’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That shows the intent in Downing street.Mr. O’Dowd said: “The loss of tens of millions of pounds of income to Upper Bann farmers will have a devastating impact on the local economy.“This money was spent in local shops, suppliers and hardware stores. “The farmer’s loss will be a loss to us all and is as a direct result of the reckless pursuit of the Brexit agenda.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"your story brought us tears says kind couple autistic boy left abandoned school bus ","story":"NI woman banned from keeping animals after puppies found in squalid conditionsService for murdered teen at spot where she was killedNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeople‘Your story brought us to tears’ says kind couple to Autistic boy left abandoned on school busThe mother and father of an autistic four year old boy, left alone on a school bus for hours, have thanked a couple who sent Ryan a special gt.By Carmel RobinsonTuesday, th March , : am\"\" after he was left on a school bus for hours\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\" webimg TUFZMTIxMjYMTIx.jpg crop:,smartwidth w,  webimg TUFZMTIxMjYMTIx.jpg crop:,smartwidth w,  webimg TUFZMTIxMjYMTIx.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" layout\"intrinsic\" after he was left on a school bus for hours\" fallback\"\" layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"A letter and cheque sent to the family of Ryan Calvertafter he was left on a school bus for hours : User Mum Gillian Calvert said she was so shocked she couldn’t speak after she read a beautul letter from the well-wishers which included a large cheque.Ryan, a pupil at Edenderry Primary School, had been left alone on the Education Authority bus for four hours last month.His dad John explained that Ryan, who is autistic and attends the Learning Support Centre, had found a piece of Lego in his bag and played with it while he was ‘abandoned’ on the bus.Gillian shared the letter and said she wanted to thank the kind couple Mr and Mrs Gaythwaite who included pictures for Ryan’s wall in the envelop.The letter said: “Hi Ryan, You are a wonderful young man. To be left in a bus for hours and site and play with your Lego was very brave.“When I read your story it brought tears to my eyes and still does. Your mum and dad must be very proud of you.“I am sending you some wee pictures for your room and a little gt. Ask your mum and dad to buy you something special from me.

We wanted to put something in the paper to thank this man and his we.“ He must live somewhere in NI.”She also wants to thank all her family and friends for the gts and cards which they had sent to Ryan.The Calvert family had been very upset at the ‘serious neglect’ of Ryan on February  when he was left alone on the private bus, hired by the Education Authority.Mr Calvert had taken Ryan, as usual, to the bus close to their home at Portadown at .am. Ryan was supposed to have been taken to the Learning Support Centre. But his father later discovered he didn’t arrive until noon that day. “We were left in shock,” Mr Calvert said.A spokesperson for the Education Authority commented: “We can confirm we are investigating the circumstances surrounding an incident on a contracted private hire route involving a pupil attending Edenderry Primary School on Wednesday  February . On becoming aware of this incident, we took immediate action as the safety and well-being of pupils is our primary concern.“We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously and have offered our unreserved apology to the pupil and their parents. As this matter is under investigation no further comment can be made as it may be prejudicial to the process.” Edenderry PS principal Stephen Doyle said they were ‘very concerned about this child being left on the bus’. He had requested an investigation.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1583928112943.jpg--coronavirus__omagh_cinema_to_leave_every_second_seat_empty.jpg?158392811600","title":"coronavirus omagh cinema to leave every second seat empty ","story":"Omaghs Omniplex cineman facility is introducing a seat separation policy in response to coronavirus.In a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-, every second seat will be left unoccupied in a checkerboard pattern.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
