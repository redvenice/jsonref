One top forecasting firm projects that revenue from the creative industries will drop by an astonishing £74billion in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus lockdown. More than 400,000 jobs will be lost by year\u0027s end - simply a human tragedy - and the damage doesn\u0027t stop there. Countless more millions in revenue will be lost to the bars and restaurants that complement theatres and concert halls around the country. At the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, we earn 91 per cent of our annual turnover and take only a 9 per cent government subsidy. At a stroke, all our income except that small subsidy has been lost. Many regional theatres have a reputation for developing acting and writing talent. In Plymouth, I gave Michael Sheen his first directing job at our Drum theatre, while David Suchet and Ben Whishaw have also performed there and James Corden, Michael Ball - a Plymouth lad - and Sir Ian McKellen have played our Lyric stage.  It is a virtuous circle of British creative talent that now circulates around Hollywood and the globe. Now all of that is threatened. South Korea shows us what can be done. It may surprise some to learn that Phantom of the Opera is currently playing in Seoul to packed houses. Cast and patrons have their temperatures taken and apply sanitising gel. Masks are worn. But people sit side by side, with no social distancing. At the beginning of the reopening, only half those Koreans with booked seats were prepared to attend. But after a dozen or so performances, the figure shot up to above 90 per cent. This is the sort of bold thinking that will be necessary to save our industry. Large-scale theatres require attendances of 70 to 80 per cent to break even, so social distancing, even at one metre, is a non-starter. In the immediate term, we need a financial support scheme for the whole sector. But equally important is political leadership. The Prime Minister and his scientific advisers must get behind a new regime that will allow theatres to open again.

With women only allowed to have one birth partner and home births restricted for a time, I spoke to women and men about how having a baby during lockdown has been for them and their new families. The project is ongoing.”Misgalla lives in south London and has been a doula for 4 years. She’s currently supporting Cath, who has undergone solo IVF, via Zoom.“I’ll be Cath’s birth partner, I’ve been supporting her since November. Sometimes doulas don’t do very much at all, but just seeing someone else’s face is enough, especially while pregnant women are in self-isolation.”Rooney lives in south London but is currently self-isolating in Bedford with her sister and brother-in-law and their three sons.“I was 42 when I started talking about IVF with friends. Once I’d decided, it all happened pretty quickly. A friend and I got pizza and a bottle of prosecco one night and went through the website.“Michele and I did a lot of the preparation together and she was there during the birth, looking after me.“Gaspar looks just like his cousin Jude when he was a baby, he feels like a total Rooney.

We Zoom with them every few days.”Kara has been a doula since 2017, supporting Becky and her daughter Silver, four weeks old, who live in Wirral.“I started supporting Becky on the day of her C-section, from when she went to hospital to immediately after the birth. Mums need a lot more support in the first week, then it gradually tapers off. Hopefully I’ll get to visit when lockdown’s over. It’ll be lovely to see them in person.”Thando has been a doula for seven years, supporting women around London and Bristol and attending hundreds of births.“It was horrible not being able to attend Colleen and Joe’s birth. I spoke to them on video call, but environment is everything in birth – you need intimacy and privacy. I haven’t met James and Juliet yet, we’ve had a telephone chat and a video chat instead of meeting face to face. I’ve been working with them since March.“We mother the mothers.

Thando has been their doula since February. McKeever and Mae were in hospital for eight days following her birth.Weber: “Mae was in intensive care for the first few days because she had jaundice. We’d meet up in NICU during the day, then Colleen would go back to her room and I’d come home and play Nintendo. I delivered supplies to Colleen in the days after. We could meet downstairs but not with Mae. Colleen held her up to the window for me.”Emily de Groot and Rashid Ariori with twins Maya and Joshua, born 21 March“My mum was going to come for a couple of weeks to help – that’s been hard because our families haven’t met them yet.

At the moment my local hospital have suspended their home birthing service. They should be up and running again by the end of June, so hopefully the baby waits!“I had a socially distanced baby shower. I saw balloons and then suddenly this convoy of cars started coming down the road! We played games, everyone was guessing the sex of the baby, we had a bit of music, sweets. That was probably the nearest to having a social connection with people. It was a surprise, I really appreciated it.”Reyhan Akyıldız-Gladstone, 31, Jack Gladstone, 30, and Aphra, born 16 MarchAkyıldız-Gladstone: “We had Aphra at home 10 days before they shut down the local home birth team. She was born at 9am on the day everyone started working from home. I was quite aware that everyone was around in their houses! I went into labour at 4.30am and by 10am we were in bed and everyone had gone. Everything happened at a crazy pace.“We have no idea when our parents are going to meet her. My dad lives in Turkey – he had flights to come over but they were cancelled.“It’s had advantages, getting to know her and her getting to know us. The three of us have our little routine.”James Dow, 36, and Juliet Cochrane, 34, east London, who are expecting a girl on 21 JuneCochrane: “It’s definitely going to be different. The grandparents and siblings will have to self-isolate for two weeks when she’s born, and even then they might not be able to hold her. They might, it’s so hard to know what the right thing to do is. There’s a real plus side in slowing down and having time to really plan and get things organised. It’s quite good for us as a family.”Nilufar Anwar, 35, Johan Bjerke, 38, and baby Alma, born 13 AprilAnwar: “At hospital, my midwife’s name was Rachel. I wouldn’t be able to recognise her again as she wore a mask the whole time. It’s strange to go through such an intimate, intense, life-changing experience with someone you can’t really see. I would have loved to have given her a hug. But the pandemic has given us time to do nothing but adore every move and sound that Alma makes, and slowly grow into our new role as parents.”Raquel Ruiz Tognetti, 40, with baby Leonardo, born 20 April“I’m a solo 40-year-old mum, and had a complicated delivery in the worst weeks of the pandemic. My parents were supposed to come and help, but they were stuck in lockdown in Venezuela. In hospital you could feel the fear in everyone. Since the delivery, things have been much better, but I’ve been weighing my baby at home as the midwife visits stopped. Sometimes I think Leonardo thinks I’m the only human on earth.”Helen Ward, 35, and Oli Evans, 37, with daughters Emily, 4, and Erin, born 19 MarchWard: “We feel a lot calmer now. the start of this was insane. I was so anxious, crying all the time, really stressed. Now Erin’s putting on weight, I feel better about things. Emily has been remarkably fine. So far only Oli’s sister has met Erin, no one else. Friends have come for distanced drive-by drinks and cuppas so they’ve only seen her from afar. The experience has been otherworldly at times. Erin isn’t registered with a birth certificate yet, so coupled with no one meeting her, it’s almost as if she doesn’t exist.”“It’s nerve-racking taking the bus to maternity appointments. Even though you have a mask on and other people have a mask on, you still feel on edge. My partner can’t come to any scans, so we’ve booked a private 4D one so he can see her.“I’ve mostly been worried about the baby when she’s here, I’m not worried about myself. I think her grandparents can meet her with a mask, not touch. Maybe everyone can meet her around Christmastime. Hopefully it’s over by Christmas!”Sherica Spence, 34, and baby Caleb, born 4 March“The morning we checked out of hospital, I heard them say they had two confirmed cases of coronavirus. I just wanted to go home. We saw family and friends for the two weeks before lockdown, but after that we couldn’t see anyone. Everyone made sure we had food in the house: toilet rolls, nappies and wipes.“That was weird, having to rely on people. I’m a person that does everything myself. Celeb’s dad thought he might have the coronavirus, so he was at his house, doing video calls, making sure we were OK. I’m just lucky that he’s a peaceful child. He’s so good!”Lena Buhler, 31, and Johnson Aboaba, 27, due 1 SeptemberBuhler: “We were supposed to travel for work over March, April and May, but that was all cancelled. The hardest thing is not having a routine – that can make you feel a bit lost. My mum would have come over from Switzerland during this time but instead she’s been ordering baby stuff to the house. After the initial worry and anxiety subsided, I’ve found this to be good for us as a couple. Johnson’s been good. It’s a strange time for him but he’s been very calm.”Nissa Moger, 36, with baby Indy, born on 8 April“Indy was born in hospital and we were home 12 hours later. We were planning a water birth at home, but at that time they’d stopped the service, so we went in. It wasn’t what I planned, but the midwives were brilliant.“I work at St Thomas’ on the labour ward as a midwife and I teach hypnobirthing. All the classes moved online in March as soon as they said mums were at risk. It’s worked really well. I think initially my clients were more anxious because it was the unknown, but they seem more settled now.”Tammy Woodhouse, 30, and Adam Woodhouse, 28, due 9 AugustTammy: “They announced the lockdown the night of our 20-week scan, so off we went to our appointment. There were signs up, but we didn’t really read them, we just went up, and they told Adam he couldn’t be there. We had no idea. I just sat in the waiting room crying! It was a shock.“They let me FaceTime Adam in the appointment, but it turned out I had my hand over the microphone the whole time! In the first trimester I was sick quite a lot, but the second one’s been an absolute dream. I’m a little bit sad I had to spend it indoors.“I’ve deleted all my news apps – that was probably the best thing. I think it was just watching the numbers go up and up and feeling completely helpless.”Esther and Shahin Najafipour, both 31, with baby Milo, born 21 MayEsther: “I was in hospital for two days when I had him. No visitors were allowed. I work as a costume maker for film and had made 85 pairs of scrubs for the local hospitals while I was on furlough. Some of the nurses were wearing ones from the same batch. The midwife that delivered him was wearing some.”Shahin: “Normally, I would get two weeks’ paternity leave, so I’d go back next week, which doesn’t seem that much. It was kind of a blessing to be home as well and help where needed.”Farah Habibi, 28, and Faisal Imadi, 27, two-year-old Araaz and baby Zaayan, born 6 MarchHabibi: “Zayaan was born two weeks before the lockdown. My mum stayed for two weeks, then I sent her home. She would usually have stayed with me a lot longer. We FaceTime with her and my sister everyday.“My sister’s been dropping food outside the flat for us. We were self-isolating with him, but I’ve started going in the garden now.

He put some music on and said he was good to go. I didn’t have time to be nervous’Early in the autumn of 1985, Prince’s assistant called me and said: “Prince would like you to come to France to be his personal photographer for the new film he’s making.” I packed my bags and jumped on a plane the next day to Studio La Victorine on the French Riviera, to document the filming of Under the Cherry Moon, Prince’s directorial debut. I was only 25 at the time. To this day, I think it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever done.It wasn’t my first time working with Prince. A few months earlier, Warner Brothers asked me to help him put together the album artwork for some of the smaller bands he was working with. I was mostly shooting his proteges – not Prince himself – but we got to know each other and I learned what he liked.I had shot a few concerts, some bands, but no real celebrities. Then there I was, in the Cote d’Azur, surrounded by megastars. Warner Brothers had assembled the most star-studded crew you could think of: Academy award winners, the best cinematographers in the world, the best set designers – everybody you could imagine was there.I arrived a week before filming got under way and I was in awe. Being in this place where Truffaut had made a number of his films with some of the leading lights of cinema felt like I was witnessing something legendary.There were some technical things like locations and lighting and sets that were still being worked out, so I thought I’d have time to soak it in. I soon learned that Prince didn’t like his time to be idle. He was constantly at work, whether it was playing, recording, shooting a music video or a photo session. In the first week, his assistant announced that the formal photo shoot would take place that day. Two hours later, I was shooting Prince.I didn’t have time to be nervous. The focus that kicked in was what I imagine people who do extreme sports feel. You know if you falter for even a second you will fail. So I focused, intently, and made sure I got what I needed.He led me towards a huge soundstage and we decided to keep things simple: I set up a white background with some unfussy lighting. I was fascinated by stripped-back portraiture at the time so I knew I wanted an image with nothing getting in the way. Prince let hair and makeup fuss over him, and then sent them all out of the room when he was ready. He put some music on a small boombox, and told me he was good to go. Within three rolls of film, I knew I had the shot.I captured exactly what I set out to achieve: something simple, dramatic and iconic. The way the delicacy of his face offsets the muscularity of his stomach and the drama of his hand gestures makes this photo special for me. It ended up on the cover of his album Parade.It was the start of more than a decade photographing Prince. I’ve worked with people of immense talent throughout my career, but nobody compares to him. Prince was Prince from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to sleep: he was meticulous in his art at every moment. Not once did I see him lose his temper or cause a scene, and working with him over such a long time frame allowed me to witness him in so many different iterations. Every year would herald a whole new reinvention, both in his aesthetic and his sound.We parted ways in 1996. It was an amicable split. I didn’t hear from him for years, but we caught up in the early 2010s about making new work. Then, inevitably, he got swept on to a different project, and we never had chance to reconnect after that.When I heard the news of his passing, I didn’t believe it. It sounds absurd, but I just didn’t believe he would die. The man was so endlessly creative that it was impossible to imagine his death. I spent 11 years of my life photographing him. Now, I hope my archive captures something of his inimitable creativity.• Limited-edition prints from Jeff Katz’s archive of Prince are available from his website, princebyjeffkatz.Trained: BA in film and cinema, Ithaca College, New York State.High point: “Being able to do what I love every day.”Low point: “The death of film.”Top tip: “Slow down, think more about your shot, and make something that makes people stop scrolling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b7a3a686f3fee2b41a3a7eacac4b74be49e39a/0_159_3378_2027/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1117e21718935dd1d8cd9461c2710586","title":"grace jones jagger gaga and more music legends in pictures","story":"From Bowie outtakes to early shots of Rihanna and Amy Winehouse, these rare prints are being sold to support the entertainment industry during Covid-19 and fight racial injustice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f34e095952d68b947189e5fd9bad47bbe905c49/263_0_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e8a4a96d962ff5dfdc3951a0b7e93d2","title":"run a business that cant reopen tell us how you feel","story":"Some businesses will be able to return next month, but others such as nightclubs and nail bars are not allowed.

Virgin Atlantic was told, in effect, to ask its billionaire controlling shareholder for a few quid before troubling HM Treasury – quite right, too.Tata Steel UK, though, has a decent claim to specialness, meaning importance to the UK economy, a key condition of access to the Treasury’s “last resort” Project Birch scheme. Steel is a foundation industry, in the jargon. Aside from thousands of direct job losses, a large failure would have severe knock-on effects in the bigger UK sectors of automotive, aerospace and defence.That wider financial disruption may be tricky to measure, but no other major European economy would dare to leave itself so exposed to steel imports as the UK already is. If the government has any pretence to running a meaningful industrial strategy, it cannot allow the steel sector to buckle under Covid-19 pressures. We’re meant to be a nation of builders once the pandemic passes, remember.The Treasury’s other Project Birch demands relate to corporate viability and the exhaustion of other borrowing options. The latter is hard to judge from outside, but viability is probably the trickier hurdle since Tata’s steel operations have been loss-making in the UK for the past two years. Take the long view: Tata is in the midst of a modernisation programme and the Treasury, from the commanding position as lender of last resort, would be free to insist the pace accelerates.Indeed, the conditions attached to a £500m loan would be the important part. A few should be obvious: none of the cash should leak to Tata’s operations overseas carbon-reduction targets should be set and the public purse must be protected by ensuring the Treasury is top of the tree of creditors, even if that opens the door to partial nationalisation in a future crisis.Sunak, who is definitely not an interventionist by instinct, will hate the notion that the state could end up owning stake in a large steel producer. He seems, though, to have opted for pragmatism because a loan looks likely to be granted. Or perhaps he’s been reminded by number 10 of the importance of the “levelling up” agenda. Either way, a loan is the right move. Don’t take risks with a strategic industry in the midst of a temporary crisis.Smart move by Roger Devlin, chairman of Persimmon, the housebuilder trying to demolish its reputation paying zillions to its bosses to build shoddy homes: hire an outsider as chief executive.Cultural reform, which is what Persimmon says it’s pursuing, should be easier if fresh eyes are looking for defects. Stephanie Barwise QC, in a damning report to the board last year, compiled a long list. Rough summary: Persimmon didn’t have the first idea about customer service and saw itself as a “land assembler and house-seller rather than a housebuilder”.All that, remember, was on top of a £75m bonus for tone-deaf chief executive Jeff Fairburn, who was replaced by his £45m deputy, David Jenkinson, who was a calmer presence but not convincing in the role of agent of change.In March, easyJet paid a £174m idend to shareholders, including a £60m slug for founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his siblings. Now the airline wants £400m-£450m to flow in the other direction via a share placing with investors.We wait to see if Sir Stelios participates, or whether he’s still in a blind rage over the Airbus contract. He cannot, though, be surprised by the fundraising.Flights have returned in limited form, but big uncertainties remain – like a second wave of infections, and even consumer appetite for flying this summer. The board’s job is to take advantage of an improved (since May) share price by strengthening the balance sheet – £400m-ish roughly delivers for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1164c72298b59ec21c5c7dc67272451c174f216/0_171_4479_2687/master/4479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=777d27327c95aa4058f4a172834720d1","title":"the guardian view on scientists in downing street a brief encounter","story":"Boris Johnson sometimes uses experts to bolster his authority but his real guide is fear of being held responsible for bad governmentIt is clear from the volume and complexity of new hygiene guidelines that the grand reopening of England’s consumer economy, scheduled for 4 July, marks no return to normality. The long-deferred pleasure of the pub will be diluted by measures to enforce physical distance between punters. Fear will still keep many away.Britain’s struggle with coronavirus has certainly moved into a new phase, but the transition is more political than clinical. The shift is symbolised by the abandonment of routine Downing Street press conferences. It is hard to mourn the passing of an institution that was often characterised by obfuscation, but the decision to dispense with the exercise is revealing. The government no longer wants the burden of sharing information with citizens.Sometimes the press conferences let in light by accident. The decision to stop publishing a graph showing international mortality rates spoke volumes about the government’s shame at a British death toll surpassing most others around the world. As lockdown comes to an end, ministers might be relieved not to face televised questions on infection rates and hospitalisations.A subtext of the new regulations is that responsibility for managing the pandemic will become more diffuse. Businesses and their customers will somehow have to negotiate a new modus operandi to balance economic activity with safety. Local authorities will have to respond to outbreaks of Covid-19 on their patches, although few have sufficient resources. Budgets were already hollowed by austerity. A study by the Centre for Progressive Policy, a thinktank, has found scores of English councils – potentially one in eight – vulnerable to bankruptcy from the additional cost of handling the pandemic. Then there is the logistical obstruction of coordinating with central government. It is unclear how councils will interact with a national test-and-trace mechanism, hastily assembled from contracts with the outsource company Serco.The precedent from this kind of arrangement is systemic dysfunction with accountability falling in gaps between multiple agencies and institutions. There is also ample precedent for Mr Johnson seeking to evade responsibility for bad decisions. When talking about the pandemic response, he uses the rhetoric of shared national effort, and while it is true that people across the country deserve enormous credit for sacrifices they have made, there is cynicism in the prime minister’s effort to launder his own reputation in the collective endeavour.Britain has suffered more from Covid-19 than other European countries because Downing Street was slow to appreciate the scale of a threat that could easily have been grasped by observing events already unfolding across the Channel. Ministers have subsequently tried to parcel blame on to scientific advisers, whose counsel Mr Johnson claims to have followed. That, too, is a device for evading responsibility. Political leaders take advice on countless decisions, major and minor, but ultimately apply their own judgment. So it is now with the release from lockdown, as scientists sound more cautious than ministers. A calculation has been made inside Downing Street that the economic cost of keeping businesses closed any longer would be too high for any precautionary benefit in further repressing the infection rate. Mr Johnson would prefer not to get the blame if that turns out to be a mistake and blurring the lines of accountability is one way to achieve that, as is controlling the flow of information.The government has already been chastised by the national statistics authority for misleading the public on rates of testing. As economics became the overriding impetus behind policymaking, scientists began appearing less frequently in press briefings. They will now be spared the ordeal altogether. In the early stages of the crisis, Mr Johnson borrowed the credentials of qualified medical professionals to bolster his authority. He had not previously been one for deferring to experts and the truce did not last long. He appears now to be straying back on to more familiar territory – the place where facts are not independently verifiable things but plastic political expedients fashioned from assertion, self-belief and an optimistic tone. In that respect, if no other, the easing of lockdown signals a return to business as usual for Mr Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2596342143b8e4bf06120d2a0052235b77abdab6/189_178_3311_1988/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d578a13ba960da80dc821370633749","title":"worlds poorest people coronavirus vaccine gavi","story":"Rich countries’ governments are putting all their trust in a marriage of markets and philanthropy called GaviVaccines for Covid-19 are coming.

The failure to address this question in the past has resulted in millions of unnecessary deaths – and yet, some believe there is a simple answer. Ask pharmaceutical corporations about how they will ensure access to Covid-19 vaccines, and they say “Gavi”. Ask the wealthiest governments in the world what they are doing to ensure global equity, and they too say “Gavi”.Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, is a 20-year old public-private partnership that believes the marriage of markets and philanthropy will bring vaccines to everyone in the world. The numbers are impressive: every year, Gavi sends out 500 million vaccine doses against 17 different diseases. The sums of money pumped into Gavi are equally impressive. At the Global Vaccine Summit held earlier this month, Gavi raised a record-breaking $8.8bn. With £330m committed annually for the next five years, the British government is their single largest donor, alongside other wealthy countries and the Gates Foundation. At the summit, Gavi launched its newest initiative, a fund for future Covid-19 vaccines – the Covax Facility – which invites countries to invest in a wide portfolio of potential vaccines, pool their risk, and gain dedicated access to eventual products.Gavi heavily publicised a unit of the Covax Facility called the Covax Advance Market Commitment (or AMC, and yes, it’s confusing) that deals with the access side of things. The first deal – a US$750m agreement with AstraZeneca for 300 million doses of the potential Oxford University vaccine – was heralded as a commitment by industry to meet the needs of the world’s poorest countries. But it came at a high price, representing only a minor discount over the full price paid by the US government. The problem is, we know very little about this deal because the agreement isn’t public, despite all the public money involved. We don’t know if, for example, AstraZeneca gets to keep the money if its vaccine fails. We don’t even know for a fact that all the vaccines bought are intended for use in poor countries. We asked AstraZeneca about this but did not receive a response in time for publication.Rich countries are “encouraged (but not required)” to donate vaccines if they have more than they need, but we do not know when poor countries will get these donated vaccines: will it be at the same time as the rich countries, or only after they have used up all the vaccines they need? We put the questions raised by this document to Gavi, but it was unable to provide answers before this week’s board meeting. The prospect of a two-tiered system puts into question the fundamental issue that Gavi was founded to address: equitable access to vaccines. In many ways, Gavi has helped create the problem it is now trying to solve. Three decades of getting medicines and vaccines to poor people have revealed the problem and the solution: monopolies over vaccines in the pharmaceutical industry, enforced through patents which, when suspended, result in prices going down and supply going up. The rich countries and organisations who fund Gavi are equally culpable: the US, UK and EU have committed billions towards vaccine research, almost all of which has gone to private pharmaceutical companies – without any conditions to prevent them from monopolising their vaccines.All these countries have further stockpiled future vaccines by making direct deals with manufacturers, again without any access conditions whatsoever. In failing to challenge the most perverse feature of the pharmaceutical industry – monopolies that block access to their products – Gavi is in step with the governments who fund it. At best, Gavi has failed at negotiating control over the vaccines it funds. At worst, it believes that pharmaceutical monopolies, which have thwarted equitable access, are somehow essential to achieving it.And unaffordable prices are only one part of the monopoly problem in this pandemic, expanding supply is a major challenge. We have a shot at making enough vaccines for everyone, everywhere, if we put the planet’s full manufacturing capacity to use. But that can only happen if the vaccines are set free. Gavi’s inability to consider this problem, or use its leverage to force a solution, is baffling.Pharmaceutical companies say they will make no money off the pandemic, that they will supply vaccines at a cost. Yet, they have already seen multibillion dollar increases in their market capitalisation, and are unwilling to relinquish the monopolies that drive their outsize profits. Leaders of rich countries (apart from the US) have said all the right things about equitable access to vaccines. Yet they are entering into multiple advance deals to stock up on possibly far more vaccines than they will ever need. They cannot have it both ways, and neither can Gavi. Seth Berkley, the Gavi CEO, cannot claim to want “the world to come together” with “no barriers” while failing to tackle both rich country nationalism and pharmaceutical industry greed.Gavi can change the rules of the game and turn the Covid-19 vaccine into a global public good.  It can ask far more of the pharmaceutical companies it is funding, and it can force the entire vaccine ecosystem to join a cooperative, collaborative and monopoly-free mechanism like the WHO’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. This would be the right move to make, and in doing so, Gavi could finally deliver on the promise it made to the world 20 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3a5e67b064e078e4b8e7b18f4e7bf199dbcc76/0_321_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2f2685ab1b191bc2d7ca23a5cbc45093","title":"my land is now owned by lions maasai farmers offer kenya wildlife a lifeline aoe","story":"Parsaloi Kupai’s home, situated on the edge of Ol Kinyei conservancy near the Maasai Mara game reserve, is no different from any other Maasai homestead – oval-shaped huts with an almost flat roof and walls plastered with a mixture of water, mud and cow dung. At the centre of the homestead is a cattle boma, an enclosure where his livestock spends the night, safe from the many predators that roam the area.Kupai, 47, and his two wives chose to live here after they surrendered 69 hectares (170 acres) of land to the 7,500-hectare conservancy. He is among 240 landowners who gave up their highly valued grazing land for the project.“I cannot graze on that land any more,” he tells me, pointing to a hill far into the horizon, the outer reaches of the conservancy. “It is now owned by elephants, wildebeests and lions.”In 2018, Ol Kinyei achieved IUCN Green List status for its good governance, sound design and planning and effective management.Michiel Veldhuis, lead author of the study from the University of Groningen, concluded: “There is an urgent need to rethink how we manage the boundaries of protected areas to be able to conserve bioersity. The future of the world’s most iconic protected area and their associated human population may depend on it.”Communities around the national reserve were driving their livestock further into protected areas. This encroachment, coupled with a lack of clear strategy by the government, has brought wildlife conservation to a crossroads.The conservancy model, Kaelo says, is one way to tilt this imbalance, and in the greater Mara region, more than 14,000 landowners have embraced the idea by forming 15 conservancies that offer close to 142,000 hectares of refuge to wild animals. Apart from Ol Kinyei, other conservancies in greater Mara include Naboisho, Olare Motorogi, Lemek, Mara North, and Siana.Landowners in a conservancy identify a tourism operator willing to set up a safari camp within the new block of land. The operator benefits from tailor-made safaris since a conservancy has a higher concentration of wild animals owing to enlarged rangelands. Funds derived from conservation and accommodation fees and philanthropy are shared between the operator and landowners at an agreed percentage.Kupai receives Ksh20,000 (£193) every month for the land he surrendered to Ol Kinyei conservancy, money that he invests in livestock and his children’s education.Critics, however, ask whether setting up community-based conservancies is the best form of land use, as opposed to farming or raising livestock. Some landowners have protested over what they see as skewed agreements between them and tourism operators, with the latter being accused of making huge profits at the expense of landowners.In their defence, conservancy proponents argue that both agriculture and livestock-keeping heavily depend on adequate rainfall, something that is in short supply around the Mara. In addition, they say the soil in the area is too rocky for any meaningful form of farming to take place, and that mechanised farming is too expensive for the many small landholders.“Ideally, a conservancy is a commercial venture and an alternative form of land use to the local Maasai,” says Simon Nkoitoi, the senior warden and manager at Ol Kinyei Conservancy. “The economic benefits derived from this form of wildlife conservation outweigh other commercial ventures, otherwise the local Maasai would not trade their grazing fields for wildlife conservation.”Ol Kinyei was set up in 2005, partly due to the efforts of Jake Grieves-Cook, a veteran of the local tour industry who has worked in sustainable tourism for more than 40 years. His tour operations outfit, Gamewatchers Safaris, operates camps in a number of conservancies in Kenya, including Ol Kinyei.Operators like Gamewatchers must adhere to strict tourism regulations laid out by the group conservancy management. As an example, there can only be a single tent per 700 acres and no more than 12 tents per camp. Low tourism densities in such conservancies mean the few guests have access to thousands of acres, increasing the chances of a memorable wildlife experience. The carbon footprint is kept to a bare minimum.The economic benefits of a conservancy go beyond the land-leasing fees paid out to landowners. In the largely rural settings where conservancies are located, safari camps have created job opportunities for youths who now work as camp managers, drivers and tour guides, housekeepers and chefs.Nkoitoi is part of the conservancy management team. His role includes overseeing a team of 19 rangers charged with securing this vast piece of wild Africa. A smartphone app known as Wild (Wildlife Information Landscape Database) assists Nkoitoi and his team in collating wildlife numbers and their location, information that is then transmitted to the conservancy rangers’ post. The application also helps map out possible human-wildlife conflict hotspots. In the greater Mara ecosystem, such conflicts are not in short supply and continue to test the fragile coexistence between local communities and wildlife.Sitting under a giant yellow-backed acacia, Nkoitoi’s phone rings. On the other end is a ranger who informs him of an elephant incursion into a human settlement. “We will check it out in the morning,” he tells the caller. “If we don’t address such issues in time, those people can take matters in their hands,” he says after hanging up. “They can get trampled by the elephants as they try to chase them away.”The following morning, Nkoitoi visits the village, Ereyiet Oltome, located on the eastern edge of Ol Kinyei. Tempers are high following the invasion of elephants. Several homesteads stand a few metres from a thicket where more than a dozen elephants are holed up. The previous day, an elephant had chased a young man who, in a bid to distract his pursuer, threw his traditional wraparound to the ground. “Look! This is what the elephant did to his shuka,” a young man says, holding the tattered cloth belonging to his friend who was too traumatised to venture outdoors. He was fortunate. Some don’t live to relate a close encounter with an elephant.Nkoitoi is soon joined by Marc Goss, head of the rapid response unit at Mara Elephant Project. The villagers are relieved to hear the roar of his helicopter, a sound they have heard before when elephants have invaded their farms. For hours, Goss tries every trick in the book to drive the elephants back to the conservancy. “It is tricky driving elephants out of the private fields,” he says during a break in the operation. “They are clever animals. Mothers will never leave their young behind. Some even go under the helicopter to avoid detection from the air.”By 2pm, a handful have been driven back to the confines of the conservancy. “At least we tried. We did our best,” says Goss. The operation was set to continue next day.Elephant incursions into human settlements are a new phenomenon around Maasai Mara. While the conservancies have increased the land under wildlife conservation, communities on the borderlines have fenced off blocks of land partly to preserve the grass for livestock. Grazing is allowed in some conservancies and outlawed in others. Elephants are attracted by the lush grass within the fenced-off areas.Despite the periodic conflicts between wild animals and humans, there is general agreement that the conservancy model is the way to go in preserving what most of the world has lost.With funding for the conservation model disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has prevented thousands of foreign tourists who would have trooped to the Mara to watch the annual wildebeest migration, a number of emergency fund appeals have been launched. For example, £44,867 has been raised to support local communities and protect endangered wildlife in Mara Naboisho conservancy, while Gamewatchers is urging donors to adopt an acre of land for a year with a donation to the Wildlife Habitat Trust, a fund set up to help to pay the wages of staff working in the conservancies as well as the land leases.The Kenyan government has also announced it is setting aside 2bn Kenyan shillings (£15m) in the coming financial year (starting July 1) to support wildlife conservancies. “We have hope that wildlife will flourish,” says Kaelo of the conservancy model. “This will happen if investment in our national parks and reserves is quadrupled and private landowners and local communities are effectively incentivised to ensure wildlife is perceived as a national asset.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420aec0f94937439eec87993973893b674966f63/189_0_2636_1583/master/2636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=750427ead08a63510778b87cb25853ff","title":"seasteading a vanity project for the rich or the future of humanity","story":"Beloved by Silicon Valley tycoons and tyranny-fearing libertarians, are cities atop the waves Earth’s next frontier?A white steel pole rises out of the sea off the Caribbean coast of Panama, poking above the waves like the funnel of a sunken steamship. Launched into the water last month, this is no shipwreck, but the base of what will soon become a floating home and, in the eyes of its makers, the first step towards building a brave new post-Covid-19 society, out on the open ocean.“Coronavirus is an opportunity to show the world that what we’re building is actually going to be very useful in the future,” says Chad Elwartowski, in a recent video post from his beachside base in Panama. The Michigan-born software engineer turned bitcoin trader is a leading figure in the seasteading movement, a libertarian group dedicated to building independent floating cities on the high seas. Along with the bunker builders and survivalist preppers, their long-held ambitions have been bolstered by the current global pandemic. “No matter if you’re scared of the virus or the reaction to the virus,” he adds, “living out on the ocean will be helpful for these situations.”It is not the first time Elwartowski has attempted to realise his dream of a floating future. In April last year, he and his Thai partner Supranee Thepdet (aka Nadia Summergirl), were forced to flee their first floating home off the coast of Thailand, just moments before it was raided by the Thai navy. They had constructed what they declared to be “the first seastead” 12 nautical miles from Phuket, but the authorities decided that the six metre-wide fibreglass cabin, perched on top of a floating pole, posed a threat to Thailand’s sovereignty. It was an offence punishable by life imprisonment or even the death penalty. “The couple announced on social media declaring their autonomy beyond the jurisdiction of any courts or law of any countries, including Thailand,” said Rear Admiral Vithanarat Kochaseni, adding that they had invited others to join them. “We see such action as deteriorating Thailand’s independence.”After a few weeks on the run, dodging Thai patrol boats and eventually making their way to Singapore, the couple moved to Panama to relaunch their company, Ocean Builders with the financial backer of the project, Rüdiger Koch, a retired German aerospace engineer. “This event has doubled down our efforts,” the group said in a statement, following the Thai ordeal. “We can all clearly see that seasteading needs to happen now as tyranny creeps ever more deeply into our governments to the point that they are willing to hunt down a couple of residents residing in a floating house in middle of nowhere.”The coronavirus pandemic has given fringe libertarian groups around the world renewed vigour to pursue their dreams of building autonomous new societies. Government-enforced lockdowns and increased digital surveillance have added fuel to their suspicions of state control, while the suspension of day-to-day norms and the spectre of an economic meltdown have amplified their calls to rethink society. “When you’re not sure which virus is more contagious,” says the slogan of a recent meme made by Americans for Liberty, shared on Elwartowski’s Facebook page. “Covid-19, or those fine with complete government control.”The sentiment lies at the core of the seasteading community, a disparate group that has grown since 2008, when the Seasteading Institute was founded in San Francisco by Patri Friedman. The self-styled anarcho-capitalist (and grandson of Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman) was working as a Google software engineer when he managed to attract funding from PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel to set up the institute. In a founding statement, they described its goal as being “to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with erse social, political, and legal systems”. Thiel was nothing if not confident: “The nature of government is about to change at a very fundamental level,” he proclaimed.Seasteading represents the ultimate Silicon Valley approach to governance, conceiving society as a technology that can be hacked and innovated upon as simply as an operating system. It is predicated on the idea that government regulation stifles innovation, and therefore the route to a better world can only be found by unleashing a new generation of start-up societies that are forced to compete for citizens in a free market of ideologies. Don’t like the rules of your current micro-nation? Simply move to another one. “We will give people the freedom to choose the government they want,” said Friedman, “instead of being stuck with the government they get.” Its boosters see it as the route to salvation its critics say it would lead to “an apartheid of the worst kind”.Progress has been bumpy. Thiel’s donations soon dried up, and Friedman’s plans never got much further than launching Ephemerisle – a waterborne version of the Burning Man festival, staged in the Sacramento River delta near San Francisco, where rival floating pontoons compete for the attention of soggy partygoers. He has since moved his focus away from the water, recently launching a company to develop experimental cities on dry land instead. But the Seasteading Institute continues without him, headed by author and self-appointed “seavangelist”, Joe Quirk.“Nearly half of the world’s surface is unclaimed,” says Quirk, who published a book on seasteading in 2017, with the ambitious subtitle: “How floating nations will restore the environment, enrich the poor, cure the sick, and liberate humanity from politicians”. In an introductory video, he describes the planet’s oceans as “a sort of research and development zone where we could discover better means of governance”, and says that seasteading could “provide the technology for thousands of people to start their own nano-nation on the high seas”, giving people “opportunities to peacefully test new ideas about living together”. The most successful seasteads, he says, “will become thriving new societies, inspiring change around the world”.So far, his own attempts don’t bode particularly well for the future of floating utopias. In January 2017, after years of technical feasibility studies and political negotiations, the Seasteading Institute signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of French Polynesia to build the first seasteads in its territorial waters. The designs, developed by Dutch architects Blue21, looked like a high-end resort in the Males, depicting a series of villas linked by an undulating green landscape. It was all to be magicked from the waters by an initial coin offering, a form of crowdfunding through selling tokens of a new cryptocurrency, all the rage among the tech community in 2017. “We’re going to draw a new map of the world with French Polynesia at the centre of the aquatic age,” Quirk declared.The choice of location was strategic. Comprised of almost 120 dispersed low-lying islands and atolls, French Polynesia is at severe risk of suffering devastating consequences from even the slightest rise in sea level. It also happens to boast the world’s largest exclusive economic zone, an area of sea that can stretch for 200 nautical miles from a territory’s coastline, over which it can claim exclusive economic rights. At five million square kilometres, French Polynesian waters  an area as large as the landmass of the entire European Union, making it an ideal place to experiment with novel forms of aquatic jurisdiction. In theory.“We explained to the Polynesians how having a quasi-autonomous area nearby was a good thing,” says Tom W Bell, professor of law at Chapman University in Orange County, California, who drew up the legal agreement for the project. “Look at Monaco, or Hong Kong or Singapore – special jurisdictions create a lot of growth outside their borders.” In his book, Your Next Government? From the Nation State to Stateless Nations, Bell traces the projected evolution of a seastead. It would begin “like a coral polyp”, he writes, protected by a country’s territorial waters, where it would start to generate economic activity, “enriching its environment and attracting still more life”, before breaking free to start a new autonomous life on the open ocean. Ultimately, he imagines seasteads nurtured by different host nations congregating in mid-ocean gyres, sheltered within floating breakwaters. “A new kind of government arises,” he writes, “born in Earth’s last free places, fated to advance the human frontier.”The reality didn’t quite pan out that way in the South Pacific. “There wasn’t a perfect alignment of interests,” says Marc Collins Chen, former minister of tourism of French Polynesia, who co-founded the company Blue Frontiers with Quirk to realise the project. “The government was looking for something to address sea level rise and environmental degradation, whereas the Seasteading Institute was more about autonomy.” He says that the prospect of a tax-free enclave held little appeal for the locals, given that Polynesians don’t pay income tax anyway. One Tahitian TV host compared the situation to the evil Galactic Empire in Star Wars imposing on the innocent Ewoks, while secretly building the Death Star. The libertarian position didn’t help either. As Collins Chen puts it: “It’s very difficult to ask for government support when your narrative is that you want to get rid of politicians.” In retrospect, Bell agrees: “They already had a beautiful paradise in French Polynesia. The local community wasn’t very enthusiastic about the project, and I get it. They didn’t need strangers coming in and ruining their view.”Collins Chen has since moved to New York, where he has established a new company to develop further plans for floating cities, this time stripped of any libertarian tax-dodging ideology. “I realised that the real future for these sorts of projects has to be closer to cities,” he says. “They have to be an extension of an existing city’s infrastructure, they need to be run by the mayor, and they have to pay their taxes – as opposed to being enclaves for the wealthy.”His plan, titled Oceanix City, has been designed in slick Ted Talk style by Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect beloved of Silicon Valley tech companies. His twinkling animations depict a floating world of interlocking hexagonal islands, where power is harvested from waves and the sun, where residents live on a diet of seaweed and fish, and where marine life is “regenerated” by artificial reefs. “If this floating city flourishes,” said Ingels in a presentation, “it can then grow like a culture in a petri dish.” On a screen behind him, the floating hexagons multiplied until they took up an area more than three times the size of Manhattan, a vision of low-density suburbia sprawling virulently across the sea.“Over the next 40 years, the world is expected to build 230bn square metres in new construction,” says Collins Chen, “the equivalent of adding one New York City every month. This could be a way to accommodate that growth, without the devastating effects of land reclamation or deforestation.” He says part of the appeal is the ability to reconfigure the urban form according to changing needs, in a process of drag-and-drop city building. “You could literally float one a city block away and put a different one in its place, when the need for a new school, hospital or university arose.”Remarkably, their sci-fi scheme has won the support of the United Nations’ sustainable development arm, UN-Habitat, which hosted a round table discussion for the project in April 2019. As global heating accelerates, sea levels rise and more people crowd into urban slums, “floating cities is one of the possible solutions,” said UN-Habitat’s executive director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif.Back in Panama, the notion that floating habitats could be an inclusive solution to global housing need seems a long way off, to put it mildly. Despite the country’s coronavirus lockdown, the Ocean Builders team has been at work throughout, laying the foundations for a factory that will soon house the largest 3D printer in Central America, ready to produce what their website touts as “the world’s first 3D-printed, smart floating home with an underwater room wrapped in an eco restorative 3D-printed coral reef” – yours for between $200,000 to $800,000 (£160,000 to £640,000).“In light of the global pandemic, we’re really focusing on making the homes feel like a kind of lifeboat,” says the company’s CEO, Grant Romundt, who worked on the Freedom Ship project in Florida in the 1990s, an aborted plan to build a mile-long cruise ship for 40,000 people, topped with a runway. “They should be a safe place to escape to and be totally energy independent, with solar panels on the roof, water desalination on board, waste collection by drone, and aeroponic systems to grow your own food.”Designed by Koen Olthuis of Dutch architecture practice Waterstudio, the plans for the luxury “SeaPods” look like a row of gigantic motorbike helmets on poles, sticking up out of the sea in pearlescent shades of blue, green and grey. “We wanted to have something that was very futuristic looking, very clean and flowing,” says Romundt. “I didn’t want to have a 90-degree corner anywhere in the house. I think that’s bad feng shui.” The interiors recall supersized sanitaryware, envisaged as white, wipe-clean worlds of free-flowing surfaces, echoing retro-futuristic visions of streamlined space capsules. The similarity is no accident: for company founder, Rüdiger Koch, seasteading is merely a stepping stone for trialling exploits in space. He has long harboured plans to build a cable “launch loop” to propel payloads into space without rockets, and he sees the ocean as the perfect launchpad. “There are almost only large open spaces at sea,” he told German regional newspaper, Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung, “and you need them to make sure that nothing goes wrong and nobody is hit by possible flying parts.”Romundt insists that the company is merely building floating holiday homes, which will be registered as boats under the Panama flag for legal purposes, and likely operate on a timeshare basis. “That would give you the slow adjustment period,” he says, “then more of an economy would start to build as more people come requiring more services, and it would start to self-perpetuate and grow.”For Bell, the ultimate goal is to see such floating communities raise their own flags in the open ocean. “Right now, a self-flagged seastead would have effectively no status at all in international law,” he says. “The coast guard would show up, assume you were either a pirate or a floating meth lab, and tow you right back in to shore. But if seasteaders can say they have enough people and a big enough territory, and start flagging themselves, that’s when things will start to get interesting.”And if they fail? “That’s the marvellous thing about seasteads,” says Quirk. “If a government fails, there’s nothing much the people who live there can do about it, but if seasteads fail, they simply disassemble and go away” – seeing all those bitcoin dollars sink into the sea just as quickly as they were conjured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff95247a1ddeffceef53f2bb0a1e68d44d57286/0_428_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1368495f261919e0c761c1798e4eba82","title":"uks net zero pledge what has been achieved one year on","story":"The urgency of the climate emergency has grown but there has been little progress so farLast summer, Theresa May signed into law the UK’s ground-breaking target of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2050 against a backdrop of increasingly vocal Extinction Rebellion protests, school climate strikes and Brexit-related political turmoil within the Conservative party.It was one of the last acts of a beleaguered prime minister, under fire after a series of missteps and haemorrhaging support in party and country. Protesters lined the streets, businesses despaired at the lack of leadership and the government seemed to have little strategy for extricating the country from its immediate travails, let alone a viable long-term vision.Since then, Britain has been transformed by the coronavirus crisis, with the economy mired in the deepest recession for centuries and braced for a possible second wave of infections. But while the skies have cleared and carbon emissions plunged during the lockdown, the urgency of the climate emergency has only grown.As the first anniversary looms this Saturday of the signing of the net zero pledge into law, there has been little concrete action, and no clear roadmap on how to meet the goal.Asked by the  what measures had been taken on net zero in the past year, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) cited only: John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “If the government wants businesses, local authorities and households to make the appropriate investments over the next decade, they will need confidence that Britain really is committed to decarbonising the economy. But the practical measures taken by the government over the past 12 months add up to a tiny fraction of what is needed to keep us on course to meet that commitment.”The UK was one of the first countries to enshrine in law a net zero target for carbon dioxide. That leadership helped the UK gain host status for the crucial next round of UN climate talks, called Cop26, and the target – endorsed by all the major parties in last year’s general election – was intended to galvanise action across government and spur business investment.The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. The law was passed amid political turmoil over Brexit, followed by Boris Johnson’s landslide victory in last December’s general election. The subsequent redrawing of the political map was still in progress, and the reshuffled cabinet still bedding in, when the coronavirus pandemic struck early this year. These upheavals forced the postponement of Cop26 to next year, and have also, according to insiders, stalled new climate policy.Progress has been slow on key fronts, however. Billions of pounds spent to bail out airlines, carmakers and oil companies have come without green strings attached. Home heating is the biggest source of emissions from households, but there is still no strategy for insulating Britain’s draughty homes, despite clear evidence that doing so would provide thousands of “shovel-ready” green jobs. Switching from gas boilers to low-carbon alternatives is essential, but at the replacement rate the government proposes, it would take 1,500 years, according to Friends of the Earth.“To see this kind of foot-dragging so early on is hugely concerning,” said Jamie Peters, the campaigns director at FoE.Investors want to see more direction from the top, to spur private capital into low-carbon projects, while businesses want more regulation that provides clear signals that private investors will follow, as well as support for large-scale trials of new technologies, such as hydrogen fuel and carbon capture and storage. But while many are prepared to cut ministers some slack for having to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the government’s political opponents say the delay shows an unwillingness to take the drastic steps needed.Matthew Pennycook, the shadow climate change minister, said: “Setting a target is one thing, hitting it is quite another. As things stand, not only are the government failing to do anything like enough to meet our legally binding net zero target, they are not even on track to meet the less ambitious one that preceded it.” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem climate emergency spokesperson, said: “Without a plan to cut emissions, the Conservatives’ pledges fall far short of the action we need.” There must be clear focus on a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, added Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP. “This really is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put us on the path to a greener, fairer future. Going back to business as usual would be a one-way street to climate disaster.”A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Tackling climate change is a national priority, which is why the UK was the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We have proven that green growth is possible, and our track record of driving down emissions while growing our economy and supporting our world-leading renewable and low-carbon sectors will see us go further and faster in the years ahead.”The government will be under the spotlight later this week when its statutory adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, produces a progress report on Thursday on the UK’s emissions-cutting efforts. The CCC will recommend a green recovery, for which there are indications of public support, and the government must make a formal response.Ahead of the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s pre-budget statement, thought to be slated for 6 July, ministers must show that warm words will be backed up by action, experts said. “There are encouraging signs that the government is beginning to realise that all policy and public spending must be put through a net zero filter,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the thinktank Green Alliance. “The whole government now needs to shift gear and ensure that ‘build back better’ and ‘green recovery’ are not just slogans, but drive the economic recovery from Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc366b8c53b65cd1183e3695c6bf80616b22064/0_1070_3230_1936/master/3230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb328511bd1699320214b575f561700a","title":"act fast to stop uk carbon emission rebound climate advisers urge","story":"Report says Boris Johnson’s lack of climate leadership risks missing target and embarrassing UK at Cop26The UK is falling behind on its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and risks a surge in carbon emissions as lockdown eases, the government’s climate advisers warn.Ministers must act fast if the UK is to avoid a massive rebound in carbon emissions after the coronavirus crisis eases, Lord Deben, chair of the committee on climate change (CCC), which published its progress report to parliament on Thursday, said. By setting up new schemes to insulate homes, raise carbon taxes, switch to electric vehicles and improve broadband, the government could spur a green recovery to create jobs and cut emissions permanently.The CCC found that the lack of clear leadership and direction from the prime minister was at the heart of the problem, just as the world was looking to the UK as host of the next UN climate summit.Boris Johnson has chaired only one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change since taking personal charge of the issue last October, with the government’s statutory advisers urging him to convene the group more often, as a matter of urgency, if the UK is to meet its 2050 net zero carbon target, which is off track.Deben added: “We have to do this as rapidly as possible – this window of opportunity is closing clearly. What we do not want is a lot of good-hearted statements about beginning policies – what we need to do is seize the opportunity.”Delay in the government’s regulations for housebuilding had already resulted in 1 million new homes that were “not fit for purpose” because they had been built to old inefficient standards, he said. They would all have to be retrofitted for energy efficiency at extra cost.“That’s what happens if you don’t take these measures,” he said.The “central role” of the cabinet committee on climate change, which Johnson said last October would spearhead a cross-government push to bring down emissions, is mentioned 10 times in the CCC’s 196-page progress report to parliament, published on Thursday.The cabinet committee’s one meeting, chaired by Johnson, was in March, the  has established, and a second meeting is planned in the near future. Details are scant as the government has said it does not intend to report publicly on the committee meetings.Insiders told the  that despite the government’s public commitment to net zero carbon emissions, the lack of leadership was severely hampering the UK’s ability to meet its carbon targets and its credibility as host of next year’s UN Cop26 climate summit.“We are not being given a good lead by the prime minister and this is really undermining our ability to move things on,” said Tom Burke, co-founder of the environment thinktank E3G and a veteran government adviser. “What binds any institution, but especially the government, is leadership, and if you don’t get leadership, then people go off in different directions.”He called for Johnson to take personal control. “The point of setting up a cabinet committee is to signal the importance of the issue for the government. If you don’t follow up that signal by using the device you created, you tell people you are more interested in the headline than in the outcome.”Other recommendations in the CCC report include:The report sets out 29 milestones for the government to reach by 2030, as well as more than 130 detailed policy recommendations covering each government department. Ministers must respond to the report by 15 October.A government spokesperson said: “We agree with the CCC that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. We were the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and want to ensure the UK has the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.”Green campaigners called on ministers to act urgently, as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepared a statement on the post-coronavirus economic rescue package for early next month. Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK, said: “The likes of energy, efficiency, cycling and saving peatlands are essential, not nice-to-have measures. The CCC have shown the government where they need to put their money, and all eyes are now on the chancellor to make it happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b077433d1eaa828cdcc3d64de14dbf32bebeb59/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8ab132a36943758bb37122341404269e 1400w","title":"all hail halloumi 17 delicious recipes from salty fritters to harissa flatbreads","story":"Beyond the barbecue, there are many exciting ways to cook with this hugely versatile ingredient, from fruity salads to an easy aubergine pieThe key to the versatility of halloumi cheese is its high melting point – you can’t grill a lump of cheddar on a barbecue. Packaged in brine, it also keeps for ages – the halloumi in my fridge passes its best-before date at the end of August, and I don’t remember when I bought it. Sliced and fried (not too long a couple of minutes on each side), with a squeeze of lemon, halloumi adds a salty, pleasantly squeaky note to almost any salad. But there’s more than one way to cook with halloumi. Here are 17 to be getting on with.First up is Claire Thomson’s recipe for halloumi itself. I can see that if you’re looking for innovative ways to use up your halloumi surplus, making more halloumi is a little counterproductive, but this is a project you can embark on with kids, and the process alone is worth reading about. The recipe’s biggest drawback is that it calls for 10 litres of milk. “They’d think you were insane at the shop,” my son said, perfectly crystallising my anxieties. A couple of months ago I could have pretended I was hoarding, but not now.Halloumi has an affinity with mint – it is often packaged with little flakes of mint floating round it – but that doesn’t mean you can’t use other herbs. A sprinkle of oregano, for example, works wonders. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall uses parsley when combining halloumi with new potatoes and asparagus. In Cyprus, halloumi is commonly paired with watermelon in summer, and Nigel Slater’s grilled halloumi with watermelon salsa is a fresh, uncomplicated take on the idea. He recommends chilling the salsa for a while to heighten the contrast with the just-grilled cheese.A freekeh salad with nectarine and halloumi from Thomasina Miers offers another pairing of halloumi and fruit and, if you don’t have nectarines, she suggests that dried apricots or blackberries would work as well. This orzo and halloumi salad, although fruitless, is in the same vein.Because it stands up so robustly to cooking, halloumi is often treated as if it were another sort of food altogether. It can work as a sort of fat chip for dipping or you can prepare it in the manner of a fish finger – rolled in egg and breadcrumbs and fried and, in this case, served as an accompaniment to creamed aubergine.Thanks to its saltiness and its firm bite, halloumi is widely deployed as a meat substitute, to the extent that a fat slab of grilled halloumi in a bun has served as an emergency veggie burger at many a meat-eater’s barbecue. To be perfectly honest, you could do a lot worse, but a little extra effort is rewarded. You can team it with portobello mushrooms or with grilled pineapple, slaw and chipotle paste.For a more considered approach, try this halloumi burger from David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl, in which the cheese is grated together with carrot and courgette before cooking, and served not in a bun but in a cabbage leaf.Anna Jones uses two kinds of flour to produce crispy halloumi and courgette fritters, while her contribution to the barbecue is a harissa and lime halloumi flatbread.Cut into chunks, halloumi also makes excellent skewer material, alternated with wedges of onion, pepper and tomatoes for veggie kebabs, like those assembled by Jamie Oliver. If you are not vegetarian, you can even alternate it with meat: Natalie Salmon’s instructional video for steak and halloumi kebabs chimichurri contains hardly any instructions – she’s really just putting ideas in your head.Flaounes are a traditional Cypriot pastry made with halloumi Paul Hollywood has a recipe here. Traditionally, they contain mahalepi (or mahleb), a spice made from powdered cherry stones, which is not everyone’s idea of a store-cupboard staple, but it is pretty widely available online or in specialty shops. If you can’t source it, there are many suggestions for substitutes, including a combination of almond extract and star anise. Alternatively, you might want to try these non-traditional halloumi scones.Finally, for a quick vegetarian supper this simple aubergine and halloumi pie made with store-bought puff pastry, is hard to improve upon. Even making your own puff pastry would somehow ruin it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29474a7096d46dd812ac966b74dde8e60347f4b7/2_92_1549_929/master/1549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4da000f5a3be2da3c3accd8acbf90b4","title":"david athertons recipe for tortang talong","story":"These aubergine omelettes are ideal for a quick brunch – and make the perfect introduction to the wonders of Filipino cuisineWhy isn’t Filipino food more popular in the UK? Filipino restaurants are distinctly lacking compared with those featuring the food of the country’s south-east Asian cousins. This must change, because Filipino cuisine offers an amazing variety of delicious dishes that need to be sampled. I learned how to make these aubergine omelettes from my Filipina friend Regie while working in Malawi. They are so simple and are a great idea for brunch after a morning run (you can prepare the aubergines in advance). The sauce should ideally be made with calamansi (also known as the Philippine lime), but works well with limes normally available in the UK. It has a lovely sweet-and-sour umami.For the omelettes:4 small aubergines4 eggs2 garlic cloves1 tsp saltBlack pepper to tasteFor the sauce:30g soy sauce30g lime juice20g honeyCook the aubergines either under a grill or over an open flame until the skins are black and steam is coming out of the middle.

Luckily, our resident perfectionist has tried more than her fair share ...Flammekueche (flammeküeche, flammeküche, flammenkueche and flammenküche are also permitted by France’s Le Robert dictionaries) is a traditional speciality of the Franco-German borderlands, Alsace-Lorraine on one side, Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate on the other. It’s also known, especially outside the region, as tarte à la flamme or tarte flambée, though no alcohol is involved in its production – as the name suggests, it’s a tart, albeit one that’s cooked quickly in a hot oven much like a pizza, then topped with distinctly un-Italian combination of salt pork and soured cream.It is, however, often enjoyed with alcohol, and pairs particularly well with a chilled glass of crisp riesling or pinot blanc – preferably local, sitting at a cafe in a half-timbered square festooned with geraniums, happily watching the world go by.\u0026nbspFlammekueche recipes seem to fall into two camps: those that use bread dough and those that opt for an unleavened pastry. The latter is, in my experience, more common these days – despite being a committed consumer of the stuff, I’m not sure I’ve ever had a bread-based example on either side of the border.\u0026nbspSince that other regional speciality, the quiche lorraine, was also once made from leftover bread dough, it seems likely to me that this is the older variation, a theory backed up by its inclusion in a 1981 collection of recipes from a French television series exploring the nation’s culinary traditions, Les Recettes de Mon Village. A Monsieur Kohln, from Erstein in the Bas-Rhin, calls simply for “bread dough”, as does the late Paul Bocuse, widely considered to be one of the most important French chefs of the last century – though he hailed from farther south-west. Both versions are delicious in the same way that a pizza is, but with such rich toppings, the whole thing is unapologetically hefty. Great as a main dish, as the gloss in the tie-in recipe book to the French television programme suggests, but a bit much as a snack with drinks, which is how I’m used to consuming flammekueche.Another celebrated and much-mourned chef, Michel Roux, suggests using puff pastry in his book The Essence of French Cooking, while Gabriel Kreuther, a native of Niederschaeffolsheim now picking up Michelin stars in New York, makes a kind of flatbread, raised with baking powder and enriched with egg yolks. Puff pastry, to my mind – though a temptingly easy option if you buy it ready-made – turns this into just another tart. And the yolks make Kreuther’s base too soft and flaky for the job. The base that comes closest to those I’ve enjoyed in Alsace comes from the association of local winemakers and uses plain flour and a little oil, but no raising agent, giving it a winningly crisp texture that makes it the perfect foil for the rich dairy and pork on top.If you live in France, of course, you’ll probably be able to buy excellent dough at your local supermarket. No judgment here it’s not as if it’s the only ingredient we’re missing out on on this side of the Channel. Whatever you use, bear in mind that this is a dish traditionally baked in a bread oven, so, as with pizzas, you’ll need to crank up your home machine. I’d also recommend heating the baking tray, too, to help the middle of the base cook through before the edges burn to a cinder in the furnace.\u0026nbspIf this were a pizza, it would be a pizza bianca, with dairy replacing the familiar tomato sauce. Roux uses double cream mixed with a little lemon juice, presumably to simulate the tangy richness of creme fraiche, but if the latter, which is thicker and more interesting, is available, I’d choose that instead. Vins d’Alsace, the official site of the wine-growing area, mixes the cream with fromage blanc, a milky young cheese with a gentle acidity that’s all but impossible to find in this country. After many experiments, I’ve settled on drained whole Greek yoghurt as a decent, if imperfect substitute, or you could try Kreuther’s cream cheese, but really, if creme fraiche alone is good enough for Monsieur Kohln, it’s good enough for me.\u0026nbspInterestingly, Strasbourg textile designer and blogger Frédérique Froidevaux advises those watching their figure to use a mixture of half creme fraiche and half fromage blanc for a lighter result, explaining that, in the past, the cheaper fromage blanc was used alone. If you don’t add much, however – and I don’t think you need much – there’s no need to dilute it. I would mix it with some of the other toppings before spreading it, though it makes it go further and stops the onions from drying out.There’s very little variation here: onions and cured pork are the order of the day. Cut the former as thinly as possible and, to keep them nice and sweet, soften them in butter first, as both Monsieur Kohln and Vins d’Alsace suggest. I’d do the same for the pork, too, though it’s less important – fry it before the onions, so they can benefit from any rendered fat.That pork doesn’t have to be smoked, but for reasons of flavour, I’d strongly urge you to make sure it is the same goes for finding a cut with a decent amount of fat. That means streaky, rather than back – and go for lardons or slab bacon, if either is available the wafer-thin, cruelly trimmed slices favoured by British supermarkets these days will burn to a crisp in the oven.\u0026nbspRick Stein adds grated cheese (emmental or gruyère) in his latest book, Secret France, which makes his, strictly speaking, a flammekueche gratinée, while Froidevaux informs me that fresh mushrooms would make it a flammekueche forestière (perhaps a good option for those who don’t eat pork) a sweet spin can be made with stewed apple and sliced fruit. In fact, I’m sure you could put almost anything on there but, as with pizzas, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should.\u0026nbspRoux adds thyme to his tart, a flavour that works well with the other ingredients, but the warmth of nutmeg favoured by Kohln, Kreuther and Vins d’Alsace is even better. Most recipes are finished with a drizzle of oil but, for once, I don’t think it needs any extra fat. That said, to each their own.\u0026nbsp250g flour, preferably strong white bread½ tsp salt, plus extra for seasoning150ml water50ml neutral oil1 tbsp butter100g smoked streaky bacon or pancetta, preferably in one piece, or chunky lardons1 large onion75g creme fraiche1 good grating nutmegStart by making the base. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. In a jug, whisk the water and oil, then stir into the flour bowl and mix until you have a smooth dough. Continue mixing until it feels elastic, then cover and leave to rest for an hour.Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onion (if you have one, a mandoline would be helpful here) and, if necessary, cut the bacon into chunky pieces.Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, fry the bacon until the fat begins to render, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside, keeping as much fat in the pan as possible. Turn down the heat and fry the onions with a pinch of salt until soft and golden, but not browned.\u0026nbspHeat the oven, and a lightly greased baking tray, to 250C (conventional and fan)gas 9, or as hot as it will go. Mix the creme fraiche into the onions and season generously with nutmeg.\u0026nbspOn a lightly floured surface, roll or stretch out the dough into a rectangle or circle as close to 1mm thick as you can get it. Take the hot baking tray out of the oven, carefully transfer the base to it, then spread the onion mixture over the surface.\u0026nbspScatter the lardons all over the top, then bake for about 12 minutes, until the edges are crisp and well browned (the timings will depend on how hot your oven gets, so keep a beady eye on it). Cut into squares and serve immediately.\u0026nbsp• Flammekueche or tarte flambée – whatever you call it, how do you like yours? Bready or crunchy, creamy or cheesy – and where did you have the best one you’ve ever eaten? (I have happy memories of one eaten standing up at a wine festival in Colmar.)

Of Martial, Ole Gunnar Solskjær said: “I’m very happy for Anthony, it’s a shame he couldn’t celebrate with out fans.”For this first home game of the restart the manager selected close to United’s strongest side with only Scott McTominay missing: he was rested, Nemanja Matic coming in. This meant Paul Pogba broke a 10-month wait for a league start and was paired in the starting XI with the effervescent Bruno Fernandes for a first time.Chris Wilder made five changes from Sunday’s 3-0 loss at Newcastle, of which Simon Moore for Dean Henderson was enforced due to the latter being an on-loan keeper belonging to Manchester United.In an Old Trafford draped partly in a mosaic made from the 40,000 images uploaded from United fans from 193 countries, United’s opener was slick.Aaron Wan-Bissaka took a throw on the right and when Martial challenged the ball ricocheted to Marcus Rashford. As he can, the England man turned on the pace, glided beyond the visiting defence and fired a low ball in which Martial finished in the kind of sniffer’s strike that Solskjær likes. “I was very pleased with that one,” said the Norwegian.There could and should have been a second when a David de Gea ball to Rashford went on to leave Martial racing at Moore. When he might have taken a shot, Rashford was found instead yet from close-in an open goal was missed.United were ascendant. Rashford slipped in Luke Shaw and he was fouled. From an angle on the left Fernandes’s free-kick dipped and Moore had to beat it away. Next, Fernandes fed Rashford who found Pogba and his dink back to the forward was again stabbed at when composure was required. Then Harry Maguire headed past Moore but was adjudged to have leaned on Phil Jagielka.The home side now went to sleep, though, allowing John Lundstram and George Baldock to probe along the right. When the former was able to let fly from 30 yards it sailed over but De Gea still administered a rollicking to his teammates. After Maguire later informed Shaw to “fucking switch on” when Lys Mousset tried to pickpocket him, United finally did awaken.Wan-Bissaka left Enda Stevens trailing, zipped the ball in and Martial did the rest in a carbon copy of his first. This came close to half-time yet Solskjær remained unhappy at the interval due to a lack of ruthlessness.Solskjær had Rashford and Mason Greenwood, who were nominally on the left and right flank, switching sides, and it was from such a move that the latter, with his lightning back-lift, took aim at Moore’s goal, Jagielka doing well to kill the effort.Sheffield United had been backed into a game of unwanted defence in and around their area. Rashford, Martial, Matic, Pogba, Fernandes and Greenwood were a blur of red, pin-balling passes around their white-shirted opponents at will.Suddenly Pogba took charge, nutmegging Berge, rolling Jagielka and Baldock, before running into a crowd. Martial inadvertently dispossessed him, and shot to no effect.All of this had Maguire relaxed enough with the team’s play to ghost forward near the penalty spot and try a header from a Shaw delivery before Martial’s third, which oozed class. Pogba found Fernandes from close to halfway and he recycled ball to Martial. A one-two with Rashford ensued, then the Frenchman looked at Moore before the cutest of dinks allowed the Blades’ keeper no chance.United coasted home, Solskjær able to make a quintuple substitution with 10 minutes left that had Pogba, Rashford, Fernandes, Greenwood and Martial all departing. Next up is Saturday’s trip to Norwich City for a FA Cup quarter-final. The Canaries will hardly relish facing them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c9e663316e6c9bc03c90dcd9372b836a73e55f/0_250_4560_2736/master/4560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec45992aa6c7a786065f7af6bdf1e3b7","title":"liverpool cruise past crystal palace to put premier league title in sight","story":"The Premier League title will not arrive as anyone at Liverpool envisaged but, should this prove the victory that delivers number 19, a masterful dismantling of a Crystal Palace team led by Roy Hodgson will seem highly appropriate. The imperfections that surround Liverpool’s season are not of their making.Ten years ago Hodgson stood perplexed in the dugout that Jürgen Klopp now commands. Five years ago it was Palace that left Liverpool’s new manager feeling alone after Scott Dann’s late winner sent home fans heading for the exits.How far Liverpool have come from that low ebb and that loneliness. The club, united even while apart from its fans, stands on the verge of a first league title for 30 years after a performance that captured the best of this season’s undisputed champions. Sublime goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah, Fabinho and Sadio Mané put Liverpool within two points of their promised land. It will be only 24 hours away should Manchester City drop points at Chelsea on Thursday. So close now.Liverpool’s 56th league game without defeat at Anfield – Palace being the last victor in April 2017 – demonstrated why Klopp’s team are on another level in the Premier League this season. Four outstanding goals made it 102 for the season in all competitions, Liverpool passing the landmark for the third successive season.Their work-rate with and without the ball was ferocious throughout, so much so that Palace did not have a single touch in the Liverpool penalty area all night. No team has achieved that unwanted record since such statistics started being recorded in the 2008-09 season.Liverpool were superior in every department. Behind-closed-doors matches may have the feel of a training ground exercise at times but this was an exhibition.The return of Salah and Andy Robertson to Klopp’s strongest starting XI helped restore the fluency that was lacking after a three-month enforced break at Everton on Sunday. Their value was immediately evident as both players stretched Liverpool’s play and the Palace defence along with it. Mané and Roberto Firmino were more like their old selves in the pockets of space that opened up.Liverpool created clearer opportunities in the first 10 minutes than the entirety of Sunday’s Merseyside derby but Georginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson both miscued.Palace desperately needed an outlet but their best option, Wilfried Zaha, hobbled off injured after only 15 minutes. Pace and penetration departed with him but it would have made little difference had Zaha remained on the pitch. The visitors were completely outclassed.The breakthrough Liverpool craved arrived shortly afterwards. Jordan Ayew was penalised for a needless nudge on Virgil van Dijk when Palace had dealt comfortably with a Liverpool corner. The foul invited Alexander-Arnold to fine-tune the free-kick routine that provided Liverpool’s greatest threat at Goodison Park. He fine-tuned it to perfection, whipping the set piece over the Palace wall from 25 yards and just inside Wayne Hennessey’s right-hand post. The meaning of the goal was not lost in the celebrations of the boyhood Liverpool fan who grew up near Melwood, crowd or no crowd.Liverpool were inches away from doubling their lead when Hennessey pushed a Robertson free-kick into the path of Henderson on the edge of the penalty area. The captain connected cleanly this time but his half-volley struck the base of a post and Joel Ward cleared from Van Dijk’s scrambled follow-up.At the subsequent corner Van Dijk was clearly held by Gary Cahill but neither Martin Atkinson nor VAR intervened. It was the same again, much to Liverpool’s disgust, when Firmino’s attempted flick over Cahill struck the defender’s raised arm inside the penalty area.Undeterred, Liverpool continued to control proceedings in an increasingly impressive display. Salah was presented with a chance to lob Hennessey from distance when the goalkeeper headed Alexander-Arnold’s long ball into his path. A difficult return was sliced wide, but there was no reprieve for the Wales international when Salah next had the Palace goal in his sights.The Egypt international’s 17th league goal of the season was the product of superb play in central midfield by Fabinho. Shrugging aside the close attentions of Ayew, the Brazilian strode forward and lofted an inch-perfect chip over Patrick van Aanholt’s blond hair into the run of Salah. Liverpool’s leading goalscorer took the ball on his chest before beating Hennessey with a convincing left-foot finish.Fabinho’s next contribution was even better. The second half brought no respite for Palace and the central midfielder punished them in stunning style when he collected Robertson’s pass and, with time and space to pick his spot, drilled an unstoppable finish beyond Hennessey from 30 yards.The polish was applied with the fourth, an exceptional team goal that began at the back and saw Salah release Mané with an exquisite first-time pass that dissected the Palace defence. Mané swept his finish inside the far corner and a guttural roar filled a stadium where over 50,000 supporters would usually be. It came from Klopp. It was a reaction that said it all. Almost there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893c4234ce16d684159cfc88b869209cae30b022/70_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=193bd1a4f09548a651d062048dfc9b13","title":"ditch the fan how to stay cool when home working in a heatwave","story":"Overheating without workplace air conditioning?

But now you are working from home, in a residence that has been specifically insulated to remain warm in winter. In short, things are about to get uncomfortable.This is where I step in. For the past three years, I have worked from a garden office that effectively acts as a giant greenhouse and, in the summer months, runs between five and 10 degrees warmer than the air outside. It is hellish, but on the plus side I have developed some coping strategies. Follow my lead and you, too, can minimise the discomfort.You are working from home. HR cannot be offended if you don’t get properly dressed. At the very least, remove your socks. As things become more and more unbearable, there is no shame in stripping off – but be sure to leave some clothes nearby if you do. That way, you will panic less whenever a delivery driver knocks. This is hard-fought personal experience talking.The trick here is to open your windows but close your curtains. You want a breeze, because there is nothing worse than sitting in an airless room for an extended period during a heatwave, but you also want to keep the sun out.Even sitting still in a heatwave is a recipe for sweat, so be sure to keep your fluid levels up throughout the day. Get a water bottle and take regular sips. Avoid tea or coffee, because caffeine will dehydrate you. Your reward for drinking more water will be getting to spend more time sitting against the cold porcelain of your toilet. Don’t tell me that doesn’t sound like heaven right now.There is a reason why we eat salads in the summer – components such as lettuce, celery and cucumber have a high water content to keep you better hydrated – so these should form your new lunches. Meanwhile, try to cut meat from your diet. When your body breaks down meat, it expends extra energy, which causes heat. This is a process called thermogenesis, but you might know it better as meat sweats.I bought a fan for my office during the last heatwave, and it’s rubbish. All it does is push hot air around, which helps nobody. If you do buy a fan, freeze a two-litre bottle of water and place it between the fan and you, which should help to cool the air.If outside is cooler than inside, it makes sense to go outside regularly. Walk around your garden. Sit in a park. And leave your phone at home, because the last thing you need is a roasting-hot electronic device nestled next to your thigh.If you see someone sitting with a laptop in the park, know that they are an absolute WFH novice whose behaviour should never be emulated. Working outside is something everyone tries once and then quickly abandons. The glare from the sun stops you from seeing your screen. Your posture will be awful, and you will start to ache. If you are not careful, you’ll burn. There are too many distractions. And wasps. Working outdoors is a mug’s game.This is not ecologically sound in any way at all, but needs must. Your house does not have air-conditioning, but your car does. If you get a break during the day, drive around for 10 minutes to cool down. The fastest way to cool down when things get too awful is to apply something cold to your pulse points. A cold wet towel on the back of your neck will cool your brainstem, which regulates temperature. A bag of frozen peas on your wrists or behind your knees will also work wonders.This, though, is the top tip. If you are working from home and your boss isn’t a complete monster, try not to do any work when the temperature is at its most brutal. I start working at 6am, for instance, because that maximises the amount of work I can get done before the heat becomes intolerable. I also know tenured home-workers who switch to night work during the hotter months. The main thing is that you leave the hottest part of the day free to relax. And this is why, the second I finish writing this, I am going to switch off my computer and sit in the park with my children. Once I’ve put some trousers on first, obviously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b202ba8de986a737d3646af9539146f943859ab/700_330_3662_2198/master/3662.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5288063dc85755c78eb4233db7d5687d","title":"get this message over to airlines stop passing the buck over refunds","story":"The law is clear ... it’s the airline that cancels that is obliged to provide a full refund within seven daysI booked Virgin Atlantic flights to the US through Opodo and have been told I must accept a voucher rather than a refund. I am a 71-year-old widow and do not know if I will be fit enough to travel in 2021. I am in lockdown because of my age and health, and am in tears of frustration at the number of times I have tried to contact Opodo and Virgin Atlantic. Virgin Atlantic tells me I should obtain a refund from Opodo and Opodo tells me it is contacting Virgin Atlantic on my behalf, but I receive no information from either. Now the telephone number for Opodo is no longer available. Nearly all the complaints in my inbox are about travel, and the dominant theme is the inability of passengers to get through to the travel agents who booked their flights. Admittedly, companies accustomed to doing almost all their business online are struggling to accommodate the deluge of phone calls with a reduced workforce. Opodo has gone a step further and withdrawn its phone number and email address altogether. All too few of them – and Opodo is the exception here – inform passengers that they have the right to approach the airline directly for a refund under EU Denied Boarding Regulations. Airlines, meanwhile, are passing the buck back to the agents, some of whom deduct a fee from the refund for their trouble. MW of Watford is in the same situation as you, as Opodo told her (correctly) to request a refund from Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Atlantic sent her (incorrectly) back to Opodo. “It does not look as if I will even obtain a voucher to be able to rebook the flight at a later date, due to my inability to contact Opodo. The flights cost £2,000 which is a lot of money to lose,” she writes. Opodo customer AH of Golfe-Juan, France was referred to Singapore International Airlines for his £2,500 refund, but the airline has insisted he claim via Opodo. Coby Benson of law firm Bott and Co confirms: “If an airline cancels a flight it is obliged to provide a full refund within seven days, or a free replacement flight. The law is clear that the refund must be provided by the airline that was going to operate the flight, and not the company that sold the flight (eg, a travel agent). Virgin Atlantic seems worryingly unaware of this responsibility. It tells us: “Where a customer with a cancelled flight has booked via a third-party agent, we would advise them to approach the company that sold the original trip in the first instance, to request their refund. Virgin Atlantic works in partnership with travel agents to process refunds but with a huge volume of requests, this is taking longer than usual.” It claims customers’ contracts are with the agent, not the airline. This is untrue. Opodo’s terms and conditions, like other booking platforms, make clear that the customer’s contract is with the travel provider. “While the contract is between the customer and travel supplier, as detailed in our T\u0026ampCs, we help our customers where possible with their cancellation and refund requests following the latest guidance from airlines,” it says. “During the current situation airline policies are changing rapidly and we are seeing customers re-directed to us.” Singapore International Airlines was contacted for a comment. SP was refunded shortly after the Observer got in touch. Others who are fobbed off by airlines should put their request in writing citing the EU Denied Boarding Regulations.While some companies are exploiting customers in the struggle to survive the pandemic, others are making impressive sacrifices to do the right thing. JB of Burnley applauds Adagio (a branch of Ramblers Holidays) for their prompt and no quibble refund for their cancelled holiday which contrasted with the refusal of many travel firms to return customers’ money. Jet2 Holidays has been praised by DW of Glasgow and by many reviewers on Trustpilot. “When our holiday was cancelled we were given the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Otherwise they would contact us,” he writes. “I was dubious, but got a phone call two weeks later and when I asked for a refund was promised, with no argument, that it would arrive in seven working days. It actually appeared within three. I hope we will all remember how companies treated their customers and staff in this crisis.” LS of London was also unable to accept a voucher for her cancelled trip to Japan. “Trailfinders started the refund paperwork immediately and they call to keep us posted as we await the air fare element from the airline,” she writes. “Other holiday companies should take note.” After I reported on an NHS worker whose new bike was faulty, I was contacted by the managing director of Condor Cycles and a supervisor at Evans Cycles, both in London and neither of which were the original suppliers, offering a free repair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/448097847108cfecab97d6f1357b78bde247b499/0_29_8333_5003/master/8333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0d576c90ae1dacbb40c1cbb36d8f04a","title":"you cant pay cash here how cashless society harms most vulnerable","story":"Retailers and banks have been pushing us to use contactless payments and online services for hygiene reasons. But many older, abused and unbanked people still depend on cash. What will happen to them?It had taken so much for Tina to get to the supermarket to go home empty-handed left her in tears. Tina, 47, has conditions including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. She should not have been out at all, but, although her doctor had told her to shield indoors, she had not been put on the government’s high-risk list, meaning she has to do her food shopping herself.Tina had taken the bus from her home in Kent to her local supermarket. She had queued up outside, which is tough when you are on crutches – standing up for any period of time is fatiguing. When she got into the supermarket, she hustled around as quickly as she could and was relieved to find they had almost everything she needed. At the till, the checkout assistant scanned Tina’s items. She got out her cash. The checkout operator waved it away. “You can’t pay cash in here,” she told Tina. “It’s against the law.”Tina knew that could not be true. “I said: ‘It’s not the law,’” Tina remembers. “‘You can only refuse a note if it’s a forgery. It’s the Queen’s legal tender!’” But the checkout operator insisted – it was a card payment or nothing. Tina told her that she could not pay by card because she did not have enough money in her account to cover the shopping. The checkout operator would not budge. “I got the bus home in tears.”Tina is one of the many people who have struggled to purchase necessities during the coronavirus pandemic, as retailers increasingly refuse to take cash. A recent study of more than 2,000 people by the consumer group Which? found that one in 10 people were refused by shops when trying to purchase essential items with cash during the pandemic. Which? has long been calling on the government to protect cash as a payment option, with some success: the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, pledged to protect access to cash in his 11 March budget.If you have ever seen a queue outside banks or post offices to pay bills in cash, you may have seen people like Tina. As is the case for many people on benefits, low incomes or without access to online banking, Tina usually withdraws her personal independence payment and her employment and support allowance in cash. She then tops up her gas and electric at the bank, where she also pays her council tax, and puts the rest aside for food.Those of us who use contactless payment technology routinely scarcely noticed the coronavirus-induced switch to a virtually cashless economy, apart from the limit being increased to £45. But for the approximately 1.2 million people living in the UK who are unbanked – meaning they don’t have access to any bank account – buying essentials became a herculean undertaking. “People without legal immigration status in the UK are not legally allowed to open a bank account,” says James Tullett of the migrant and refugee charity Ramfel. When shops refuse to take cash from these people, they leave them vulnerable to bad actors, Tullett adds. “They are likely to use informal services, which are more open to being exploited.”It is not only unbanked people who will have struggled during the pandemic. People with bank accounts prefer to use cash for a variety of practical and personal reasons. “Those who rely on cash are the most vulnerable people in our society,” says Ceeney. “They may live in a rural area where they can’t get the decent broadband or mobile signal they need for online banking. Or they may be older or on low incomes.”Domestic abuse survivors often squirrel away emergency cash – the odd fiver here and there is easy to hide. “Access to cash is really important,” says Nicola Sharp of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, “both in terms of their ability to flee and their safety after fleeing.” She explains that many abusers monitor bank transactions, leaving survivors reliant on cash. “Measures to go cashless create a context in which it is more difficult for survivors to access the cash they need,” Sharp says. Age UK received a surge of phone calls in the third week of lockdown, as older people with diminishing reserves worried about how they would reimburse neighbours and relatives for their food shopping. In response, Barclays, NatWest and Tesco Bank started sending out cash through the post. But some older people were left with no choice but to hand over their bank cards to strangers and trust them to do the right thing.“I will not do banking on the iPad at all,” says Audrey, an 87-year-old retiree from Bedfordshire. “I just refuse to do it.” Normally, this poses no problem: it is a 15-minute walk from Audrey’s house to her local building society. But during coronavirus, Audrey – who has lived alone since her husband died eight years ago – has relied on her son to withdraw cash for her, which she gives to her neighbours for food shopping. “I put the cash in an envelope and leave it on the doorstep,” says Audrey. But she worries about older people without family to help out. “What if you don’t have a family?” she asks. “How do you get cash then?”Consumers and retailers favour contactless payments for hygiene reasons: there is no need for customers to handle chip-and-pin machines. “Covid has been a massive win for the digital payments industry, and the digital world more generally, as people retreat from the physical,” says Brett Scott, author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance.But, as the economy switched to contactless in a matter of days, many people were left behind. Jaki Whyte, 38, from Colchester, has only a chip-and-pin debit card. This proved difficult during the pandemic, as Whyte – who is disabled and on the shielding list – relies on care workers to pick up supplies. On three occasions, White’s care workers were refused at her local pharmacy because her card was not contactless. (She is not registered for online banking because she can’t afford the data on her phone and, until the banks reopen, she is not able to request a contactless payment card.) “It took nearly two and a half months to get what I needed,” Whyte says, “and only because a family member got a lift into town to help me out.”When Whyte ventures back into the world, she will probably find it more difficult than ever to purchase necessities. “When we emerge from covid,” says Ceeney, “our cash infrastructure will be even more unviable, and it’s likely we’ll see more bank closures. Shops need to deposit cash. If they don’t have a local bank branch where they can do that, it makes taking cash really difficult. That’s why more retailers are going to go cashless.”Some would argue that a cashless society is the future who are we to resist it? Surely people such as Audrey should receive digital literacy training and those who refuse should be corralled through the removal of ATMs, bank closures and card-only tills until the narrowing and more desperate cadre of digital refuseniks is finally obliterated. But there are ideological reasons to resist going cashless. “The war on cash is a bigger issue than people realise,” says Scott.The private banking sector, and payment companies such as Visa and Mastercard, want us to stop using cash. “These guys have been battling against cash,” Scott says. “They view cash as a cost.” (By contrast, state-run banks generally try to preserve access to cash.) When we move towards a cashless society, Scott explains, we are locked into the private banking system. “Imagine you go to a casino and you have cash with you – state money,” Scott says. “The casino gives you chips, which you can cash out when you leave. A similar thing goes on in the private banking sector. Every time they close branches or cut ATMs, they’re preventing you from exiting their system. Our ability to exit the banking sector is the single greatest thing that holds banks in check,” Scott says.The slide towards a cashless economy also raises privacy concerns. “With digital systems, there are huge amounts of data,” Scott says. “When you can see what people are buying, you can start to block payments, chaperone payments, mess with payments … financial data is one of the most sensitive forms of data around.” Moving to a digital-first system benefits the major players, something Audrey understands intuitively. “It’s all right for the big boys, for the banks,” Audrey says. “It makes their lives easy for them: no cash! But I don’t think for the small traders it will do them any good.” Retailers usually pay fees on contactless payments. She worries about how service industry workers will fare. “Suppose you go on a coach outing,” Audrey says. “Normally you put 50p into a whip-round for the guide. How would you do a whip-round if you haven’t got any cash?”This Covid-19-accelerated move to a cashless economy will hurt the most vulnerable in our society the most. “Cash dependence mirrors classic vulnerabilities in terms of income, disability and race,” says Ceeney. People who earn less than £10,000 are 14 times more likely to be dependent on cash than those who earn more than £30,000 a year. “The reason for this is primarily budgeting,” Ceeney explains. “If you’re a gig economy worker, direct debits can be dangerous. If you have a fixed amount of money in cash, you can budget for exactly what you have.” Contactless payments, which can often take a few days to come out of accounts, can skew a precarious financial balance.This is the reason Whyte prefers to use cash. “I can see in my hands how much, physically, I’ve got,” she explains. “I can’t budget when it’s not cash – I don’t know where I’ve spent my money. I can’t do mental maths like that.” Cash is either there or it is not – Tina also does not have to worry about a direct debit looming out of the digital ether and destabilising her finances. “I know what it’s like to go without food, gas or electric,” she says. “With cash, I know exactly how much is in my purse.”For Tina, having to switch to digital payments during the pandemic has been stressful. She recently got out of debt with the help of the charity Christians Against Poverty. Having to set up card payments during the pandemic – she could not pay for her gas or electricity at the bank – caused her mental health to deteriorate. Her daughter helped, but still Tina worries. “What if I’ve done something wrong and the bill hasn’t been paid?” Tina says. “It’s made my anxiety worse.”What are the long-term implications of starving a nation of its access to cash? More anxiety for Tina. Increased exploitation of unbanked people. Fewer options for women fleeing abusive relationships. People who beg and charities that rely on cash donations disadvantaged. A public locked into a private banking system from which we have no escape and increasingly less autonomy. “If we go to a cashless society, I won’t be able to cope,” Tina says.“Cash is really the bicycle of payments,” says Scott. “It preceded the car and is still popular today. We need to have a multimodal form of payment systems … cash and card working together, just as bicycles and car lanes go together.” Because, although cash may be a pain to carry around sometimes, it is actually pretty useful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4fdc34351832f6215442d0dc100daaf0c1aecb/0_286_2940_1764/master/2940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e9df5614389f39ffea1c05a66567711","title":"never mind the ballads how bardcore took over pop music","story":"Medievalised remakes of hit songs – complete with lutes, flutes and ye olde-style lyrics – are booming online. What giveth?Age: A couple of months (if we ignore Sting). Musicologists may come to see 20 April as the starting point.Appearance: Modern hit songs played on medieval instruments, often with medievalised lyrics.Is that a big thing? Where on earth have you been for the past two months? Bardcore is booming online, swarming all over YouTube and Reddit, and appealing to what i-D Magazine calls Generation Z’s “existential humour”. What’s so important about 20 April? It’s the day Cornelius Link uploaded his version of Tony Igy’s electronic dance hit Astronomia to YouTube. He called it Astronomia (Medieval Style) and the rest, my liege, is history.Surely you’re exaggerating. Nay, ’tis a veritable phenomenon on t’internet.Are you now going to say everything in this mock medieval voice? Verily. ’Tis in the spirit of the thing.It could get quite tiresome. Tell me more about Cornelius. He’s a 27-year-old German web developer with a passion for medieval music. In the spring, when the Coffin Dance meme was doing the rounds, he decided to medievalise the music used – Tony Igy’s Astronomia. This in turn itself became a meme, and Cornelius’s “Tavern version” of the song has so far clocked up 2.7m views.Pretty good, I suppose. His take on Foster the People’s Pumped Up Kicks has done even better, with almost 4m views. But, more importantly, he had created a genre (if we carry on ignoring Sting). Hildegard von Blingin’ picketh up the balle and runneth with it, adding lyrics: “All ye bully-rooks with your buskin boots  Best ye go, best ye go  Outrun my bow.” Hildegard’s version of Pumped Up Kicks is even more popular than Cornelius’s.Why Hildegard von Blingin’? Don’t play the naif. I know you’re a fan of the 12th-century German composer and mystic Hildegard von Bingen. Just testing you. Where do we go from here? The sky’s the limit. Hildegard has medievalised Lady Gaga’s Bad Romance and Radiohead’s Creep Cornelius has backdated Haddaway’s What Is Love a YouTuber called Constantine has produced Get Lucky (Medieval Style), adding the subtitle “Not to Get the Plague” Samus Ordicus offers Paint It Black. There is apparently no pop anthem that can’t be rendered with flutes, drums and primitive stringed instruments.Why now? The pandemic is thought to be significant, with a new Black Death hovering over us all. Hildegard also points out that the young YouTubers producing these cover versions have had “a lot of time on our hands” over the past few months.Why are we not mentioning Sting? Because he complicates the chronology. In a way, he could be said to have anticipated all this with his 2006 album Songs from the Labyrinth, on which he sang songs by the English Renaissance composer John Dowland accompanied by lutenist Edin Karamazov. It was, though, rather too respectful and did not exactly set ye olde pop charts alight.Don’t say: “It’s all about the loot.”Do say: “It’s all about the lute.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3095f6032b55f9daaf9696f8475070ece49cf2e/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=10dddd057abd0808d78a2736a54c99e4","title":"boris the narcissists narcissist flails wildly as pmqs exposes cracks","story":"The PM can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir StarmerWhat a difference a day makes. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson had been in his comfort zone. The Mr Bright Side telling the Commons more or less what it wanted to hear and getting little pushback even from opposition MPs. The saviour releasing the country from months of hibernation. Trusting everyone to still observe the essentials of social distancing even while they were getting pissed in newly-opened pubs and bars.Prime minister’s questions, though, exposes Boris’s fallibilities. Not because he is too lazy to properly prepare and isn’t nearly as clever as he imagines himself to be – though both of those things are true – but because the very idea causes his psyche to go into meltdown. Johnson is the narcissists’ narcissist. He believes in his inalienable right to do whatever he pleases. Even the merest hint of a challenge is an insult to his fragile ego.Someone more self-aware might realise that the coronavirus is nowhere near half-done. That mistakes have been made and others may well be in the future. That the pandemic can make fools of anyone and a degree of humility might be in order if he is to keep the country onside in the weeks and months ahead. People can forgive a lot if they feel they aren’t being taken for mugs. But for Boris any admission of failure or liability is a psychological impossibility.Asking Boris to take responsibility for his own actions is pointless. He just can’t do it, because he is the centre of his own universe, locked into his own closed system of thought. What he wants he must have. So it follows that whatever he does must automatically be right. People who disagree with him or are no longer useful to him are easily discarded as inconveniences.The trouble is that Boris can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir Starmer. For the first time in his life, Johnson has come up against an immovable object. And rather than accept the inevitable, Boris has merely allowed himself to regress.Initially he saw the Labour leader as a mild inconvenience – an unwelcome intrusion into his alternative reality – but, after discovering that he couldn’t make him go away with mockery, a few cheap gags and by trying to turn the session into an interrogation of Starmer, his feelings have turned to hatred. Keir has got under his opponent’s skin. Somewhere in Boris’s subconscious he knows that Starmer is both better briefed and a great deal sharper and he can’t bear it. So all he can do is lash out, flailing wildly, tilting at windmills.Part of Starmer’s skill is to keep things simple. His questions have a logic that even a 10-year old can follow. It’s just a shame that Boris is still stuck in the toddler age of development. The Labour leader began by pointing out that easing restrictions was all very well providing that the track-and-trace system was functioning properly. Which at present it wasn’t as it was missing two-thirds of cases. So how did the government propose to get it working properly by 4 July? Boris was outraged. How could the person who had offered him cautious support the day before dare to now challenge him on the detail? That was the kind of disloyalty only he was allowed. The Labour leader just kept plugging away. This wasn’t obstruction, it was constructive criticism, he observed, as he reiterated the point that he was quoting from the government’s own data and wasn’t interested in the one-third of the system that was working. He then moved on to the app that had been downgraded in the past few weeks from critical and world-beating to “additional support” before observing that the prime minister had misled the house on the child poverty figures last week and would he mind correcting himself. Just for the record.All that Boris had to offer was histrionics and lies. Gestures of feigned “What me Guv?” innocence, combined with blatant untruths. Boris still labours under the impression that if you tell a lie often enough then it somehow becomes true. But what might work on the campaign trail on the side of buses just doesn’t cut it when you’re supposed to be the prime minister during the greatest health crisis for a century.We reached full-on meltdown shortly after Johnson claimed he had never said the app would be anything other than “icing on the cake” – since Boris begins each day as a tabula rasa, he must think the rest of us are equally amnesiac – when he went back to the tactic of asking Starmer about schools that had been moderately successful the week before. Only this time it failed dismally as Starmer had long since answered it.The few dozen Tory backbenchers in the chamber kept their heads down. They were as embarrassed as Boris would have been had he the capacity for that level of empathy. It’s slowly dawning on most Tories that Boris just isn’t up to the job as they witness their leader unravel at PMQs week after week. Nor do many have much faith in his ability to make the right calls at the right time with the pandemic. And having used up what little goodwill he might have had – Boris has never bothered to conceal his contempt for most, make that all, of his colleagues – his support is dwindling.Too many more PMQs like this and something will start to give. And as Boris is incapable of change, then it can’t be long before his suitability for the job comes under scrutiny from his own party. It was probably always inevitable that the person who would ultimately destroy Boris was Boris himself. But Starmer is doing a great job of exposing his faults. There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9902d6a2af850c018b2050ac3a888ed7bee058d2/0_136_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e499ea047cd436fe6daed96219fb3372","title":"dominic cummings could face inquiry over special advisers","story":"Exclusive: MPs asked to examine whether PM’s chief of staff exerts excessive control• Gazza, Caino and Roxstar: the strange world of Dominic Cummings’ ‘spads’Dominic Cummings is facing a possible parliamentary inquiry following claims No 10 is exerting excessive control over ministers’ special advisers, the  has learned.The FDA union, which represents more than a dozen “spads”, has asked the public administration and constitutional affairs committee to investigate why the prime minister’s chief of staff has been given extra powers. It follows concerns that Cummings, on behalf of Boris Johnson, has centralised power in No 10 and is impeding the roles of cabinet ministers and parliament.According to latest government figures, there were 109 special advisers in December, more than half of whom were new to government, costing just under £10m a year. In the past, cabinet ministers typically hired and oversaw their own special advisers, who are political appointees paid from the public purse, though the prime minister approved all appointments.Since September, the Cabinet Office has required advisers to sign new contracts, which say the responsibility for their conduct and discipline will be jointly held between the appointing minister and the PM’s chief of staff.Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, has written to William Wragg, chair of the committee, saying there is mounting evidence that the role of spads has been radically altered to break the link with ministers and put Cummings in charge.“We have a cadre of special advisers with little security of employment and who are being directly managed by No 10 through the PM’s chief of staff. Even without the concern over how this power over employment is being deployed, it is clear that there is a deliberate approach from No 10 to fundamentally change the nature of the role,” he wrote.The committee has agreed to examine the complaint, which could result in Cummings being asked to give evidence to MPs.The FDA letter claimed that weekly meetings for special advisers, chaired by Cummings, are being used to enforce the idea that spads are now run from Downing Street, not by ministers.“There was a consistent message that special advisers were being directed in their work and essentially centrally run. The conduct of these meetings was also criticised as being overly confrontational,” Penman wrote.Following the election, Penman added, spads were being used as a central resource and moved around different departments by No 10.“This resulted in some special advisers being left without posts, and concern that the process for determining who stayed, moved or left not only lacked transparency, but was being used to exert control and dilute the relationship between minister and adviser,” he wrote.One former permanent secretary told the  there was a belief in Whitehall that Cummings was forcing out independent-minded advisers to create a pool of spads who could keep an eye on departments. “The concept of ‘No 10 narks’, placed in departments to keep a close eye on ministers and civil servants, is gaining ground,” he said.Cummings is facing a sex discrimination claim from Sajid Javid’s former special adviser Sonia Khan, after she was frogmarched out of Downing Street by a police officer last year. Javid resigned as chancellor in February after refusing to fire all five of his advisers.Before Johnson, special advisers were chosen by ministers themselves and worked directly to them, but were ultimately hired by the PM.In a further development, the Conservative party has launched a new process for the hiring of media and digital staff using the website www.spadjobs.uk.In a break from tradition, the strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy will do the initial recruitment. Paul Stephenson, a founding partner of the firm, was director of communications for the Vote Leave campaign.Though the initial screening will be done by Hanbury, the new intake of spads will only be appointed if the government’s director of communications, Lee Cain, approves, which is said to be the normal hiring convention. The Conservative party did not respond to a request for a comment.Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaigner who worked closely with Johnson during the general election, has faced intense criticism for driving 260 miles to Durham with his sick wife during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and making a further 52 miles round trip to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight.A spokesperson for the select committee said MPs were considering whether to hold an evidence session or launch a full inquiry in light of a backlog of inquiries because of Covid-19.No 10 did not respond to a request for a comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b2bd83400c40a5adb0f37879a401c0f44999db/0_230_4832_2900/master/4832.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d4d836bb718f1c22a6e1202f98327d14","title":"we dont want to give marxists doe texts between desmond and jenrick","story":"Released papers show messages exchanged between the housing secretary and a Tory donorNewly released documents show exchanges between Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, and Richard Desmond, a property developer and Tory donor, as well as other documents relating to a £1bn development in east London.This was the day of a Tory fundraising dinner where Jenrick sat next to Desmond.Text message from Jenrick: “Good to spend time with you tonight Richard.

He was not tested in Zadar, but somewhere else. I don’t think that’s right. He brought great harm to you in Croatia, and to us as a family, and to Serbia.”At Wimbledon, meanwhile, the new regime took a more kindly if firm view of their blundering 2019 champion, who is quarantining in his home city for two weeks while coping with Covid-19, along with his wife, and contemplating the evaporation of goodwill that launched his well-meant venture.Richard Lewis, who hands over to the All England Club’s first female chief executive, Sally Bolton, in August, said protocols at the US Open in August and Roland Garros in September “will be easier to enforce and observe than they otherwise might have been”. And, while he shied away from saying Djokovic had a special responsibility to the game as its title-holder, he said: “It’s a fact in this day and age that all sportsmen and sportswomen have a leadership role that goes with the territory. It is disappointing.”The notion that the virus itself has bypassed the Balkans came under further scrutiny on Wednesday when another high-profile Serb athlete, the NBA star Nikola Jokic, had to delay his return to the US after testing positive. Jokic spent time with Djokovic during the Belgrade leg of the Adria Tour.Elsewhere, five footballers from Red Star Belgrade revealed they had contracted the virus 12 days after playing in the local derby against Partizan in front of a crowd of 18,000 on 10 June, about the time Djokovic’s tour was getting under way in the Serb capital. Neighbouring Montenegro, which had been declared virus-free, later confirmed a minor outbreak there after fans returned from the Belgrade football match.There was little respite for the world No 1 anywhere outside Serbia. Paul Annacone, who has coached Roger Federer and Andy Murray, told Sports Illustrated: “I think there’s a lot of his peer group who are scratching their heads. His passion to do something good clouded all the information, all the science. It was a good cause, driven by the right reason, but the end result was pretty disastrous.”The world No 35 Guido Pella is the latest player to take Djokovic to task. “He played with many people’s health and crossed a line from which it will be challenging to return, disrespecting the world of tennis and the entire planet,” he is quoted as saying on tennisworldusa.org. “I don’t know how he’s going to get out of this.”For Djokovic the party that rumbled joyously in a Belgrade nightclub two weekends ago is over. But the hangover lingers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff267075b03d3ef1c472ed65956fc095667a9451/1315_116_2185_1310/master/2185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6118fdc8c8aab6f9e66ff7ecaa74ada9","title":"talking horses aidan obrien outlines plans for quick derby double","story":"Record-seeking trainer could rely on Russian Emperor, Mogul and Vatican City at Epsom, but Mogul’s prep has been rushedRussian Emperor, Mogul and possibly Vatican City look like forming the core of Aidan O’Brien’s challenge for the Derby a week on Saturday. Victory for the Irishman would break the trainer’s record of seven wins in the Epsom race, which has stood since Robert Robson was the first to reach that total in 1823, but O’Brien lacks an obvious star and the first three in the betting are trained in England.The difficulty this year is that the three major European Derbys will take place over a period of just eight days, starting with the Irish version on Saturday evening. Speaking in a webinar organised by Curragh officials on Wednesday evening, O’Brien said it was unlikely that he would ask any horse to run in the Derby just a week after competing in Ireland.Asked about his Epsom plans, O’Brien began by saying: “We’re thinking of running back some of the Irish Guineas horses in Epsom.” That race was just a fortnight ago and the trainer decided this weekend’s Irish Derby would come too soon for the likes of Vatican City, second in the Guineas. Though he did not mention them by name, he may also be considering Epsom for Armory, fourth in the Guineas, and the pacemaker Fort Myers.Of Russian Emperor, a winner at Royal Ascot, O’Brien said: “He looks to have come out of it well. He hasn’t done a lot, one little bit, he seems to be in good form. Entries for Epsom are on Monday. We have him down to be entered at the moment. So far, he seems to be in good form.” O’Brien made no mention of the French Derby a week on Sunday, for which Vatican City is currently second in the betting and Russian Emperor third.He appeared more concerned about the rushed preparation given to Mogul, a beaten favourite at Ascot. “He needed two runs, really, before the Derby but we weren’t able to get two runs into him. So we ran him in the toughest race over a mile and a half and we’re kind of asking that race to do two races’ job.“We had worked him as hard as we could but some horses need racing to get them there. He was very vulnerable going to Ascot but we thought, going to Epsom, he probably had to have a tough mile and a half somewhere. We just felt that was as tough as we could give him and at the same time give him a chance to make it back.”O’Brien named six horses as potential runners in the Irish Derby: Arthur’s Kingdom, Dawn Patrol, Tiger Moth, Santiago, Mythical and Serpentine. Adding spice to the rest of this weekend’s action at the Curragh, his intended runners include Magical, having her first race since winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October, and Sovereign, not seen since his shock 33-1 success in last year’s Irish Derby.He confirmed that Love, the impressive 1,000 Guineas winner, was on course for next week’s Oaks, so long as the ground does not go soft. Peaceful, his Irish 1,000 Guineas winner, is more likely to wait for the Irish Oaks later in July.Meanwhile, English King, the Derby favourite, has had a getting-to-know-you gallop with Frankie Dettori, recently booked to ride him at Epsom. The colt’s trainer, Ed Walker, said: “Frankie just wanted to come down, get a feel for the horse and he really liked him. He really wanted to get inside the horse’s head and understand him, which is a mark of Frankie’s professionalism. He rode him for well over an hour, they got on great.“He loves his personality, because he’s got a really big personality. He’s a playful horse, he’s not a boring horse, who just plods around the gallops. He’s a fun horse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b95834060829754f2f35115036e16bfe60205886/0_2496_4058_2434/master/4058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490a9aced0d2001da6991ecf8aaaad66","title":"are you planning a staycation in england this summer","story":"If you’ve booked a holiday at home this summer, we’d like to hear from youCooped-up Brits desperate for a break rushed to book holiday accommodation after Boris Johnson gave the green light for hotels, holiday apartments, caravan parks and campsites in England to reopen on 4 July.If you’re planning a staycation in England this summer, we’d like to hear from you.

In New York, liberals appear to have replaced the incumbent congressman Eliot Engel with the progressive darling Jamaal Bowman. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her district’s Democratic primary, effectively ensuring her re-election, and in New York’s 17th congressional district, Mondaire Jones won a crowded primary. Some races are still outstanding as of Wednesday afternoon. In New York’s 12th congressional district, the Democratic congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is in real danger of losing her seat to challenger Suraj Patel. The race has not been called yet.Overall, though, New York was the center of progressive victories and it’s clear the liberal wing of the party shouldn’t be written off, even in the era of Joe Biden.In Kentucky, Democrat Amy McGrath, the longtime heavy favorite candidate to face the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, found herself in a tougher than expected primary against Charles Booker, the youngest African American legislator in Kentucky’s house of representatives. As of Wednesday afternoon Booker trailed McGrath by double digits. That’s despite a surge of endorsements and support from the larger constellation of progressive groups and activists behind Booker. Tuesday’s primaries saw upset wins on both the Republican and Democratic side. In North Carolina, Madison Cawthorn, a 24-year-old congressional candidate and political newcomer, beat Republican Lynda Bennett, who had been endorsed by Donald Trump. Cawthorn’s unexpected victory once again calls into question how far the president’s reach now goes even in a Republican primary contest.Delayed election results and election-day problems are becoming the norm. Many of the races on Tuesday weren’t called by Wednesday afternoon. And in Kentucky, the McGrath and Booker campaigns filed an injunction to keep polls open to allow more voters a chance to cast their ballots. The injunction was denied.In New York, some of the races still aren’t called, even as candidates declared victory. Political strategist are expecting similar delays and a wave of mail-in ballots could mean that the presidential election won’t be called until days after 3 November.Despite a primary challenge from the attorney Todd McMurtry and receiving criticism from Trump himself, the Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie held on to his congressional seat, beating McMurtry by more than 60 points. Like the result in North Carolina, Massie’s victory calls into question whether Trump’s endorsement matters much at all in some Republican primaries. He had criticized the congressman as a “third rate Grandstander” and warned that he would be thrown out of congress, yet Massie won decisively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7431bbe10a66866815fbff1245aa23b1170589a0/0_380_2278_1367/master/2278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62c0959d3b779ac7e75fb2cca2a6d6f0","title":"life almost as we know it englands lockdown changes on 4 july","story":"Scientists describe measures for easing lockdown as nuanced and ‘an art, not a science’As multiple lockdown measures are eased on 4 July, England will enter uncanny valley territory: life almost as we know it, but with notable exceptions.Weddings can go ahead at religious venues – but with a cap of 30 participants and no singing. Two households can meet indoors, but must make an effort to stay physically distanced. Hugs will have to wait for now. Playgrounds and pubs can open, but casinos and swimming pools will remain shut.So is the pick and mix of what we are and are not allowed to do driven by scientific predictions, common sense or just intended as a broad brush signal that the risk of infection has receded, but not entirely gone?The computer models, whose predictions about the pandemic’s trajectory paved the way for a nationwide lockdown in March, are not designed to give finely calibrated directions on the safest route back out again. They can’t say exactly whether 30 is the right number at which to cap celebrations for big life events.“For those sort of questions the models ran out of road some time ago, probably at the beginning of lockdown,” said Prof Mark Woolhouse, a member of Sage, but speaking in his academic capacity as an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. “They cannot directly address policy questions at that level of granularity.”Instead, many of the latest judgement calls have been based on epidemiological evidence gathered during the pandemic. This has linked large gatherings such as weddings and religious services to a risk of outbreaks, making a restriction on size of meet-ups unsurprising.Clarity is also important. “There is nothing, as far as I know, magic in the number 30, but at least it’s something tangible for people to aim at,” said Ian Boyd, professor of biology at the University of St Andrews and a contributor to Sage. “It’s probably better than saying weddings should be as small as possible because some people will interpret that very loosely.”The decision to not permit singing during religious gatherings makes sense in the light of known outbreaks among choirs and the basic physics of how droplets spread.Under the new rules two households of any size will be able to meet outdoors or indoors, including overnight stays. People won’t be restricted to just one household, though. It will be possible to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, and the others the next, or in theory a different household every night of the week.The idea of banning large gatherings, but allowing a revolving door of guests might seem illogical. But scientists say that by staggering meet-ups it becomes far less likely that someone with Covid-19 will pass on the virus to members of multiple households during their infectious window.“An event of two households of 12 people is less of a risk than eight people all from different households,” said Woolhouse.So meetings of six people from multiple households have to happen outdoors, where the risk of transmission is considerably lower.The question of testing and tracing capacity also needs to be considered, and may have been factored in when deciding what reasonable limits were for how many people would be allowed to gather at one time.“If you can slow the number of contacts people make in any unit time, and if you get an outbreak, your chances of containing that using contact tracing is greater,” said Boyd.There is also simply the question of messaging. When Sage discussed how social contact might be steadily expanded – advice that underpinned the introduction of “support bubbles” for single-adult households earlier this month – the possibility of allowing set numbers of people or households to form larger bubbles was briefly considered. The group quickly dismissed such complex configurations because, they said, the rules would become fraught with confusion and could leave households faced with “potentially very conflictual and possibly irresolvable” decision about who to include in their list of allowed contacts.Some of the latest guidance has been questioned, however. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the recommendation that people maintain physical distancing while visiting – or even staying over – at another house appeared both unrealistic and unscientific. “How on earth that works in the house context is beyond me,” he said. “Sadly I don’t have an East wing of my property to put up guests. And the science behind that is actually quite poor.”He said that the continued focus on distancing irrespective of the length of time spent together was not in line with knowledge about how the virus spreads.“Staying 2 metres apart for two days while sleeping overnight in the same house is probably more risky than cuddling your grandchild for half an hour,” Hunter said. “There’s certainly some of the nuances that don’t seem to make sense to me when examined in isolation.”Overall, Boyd said, drawing up overarching guidance on how to ease the lockdown would be best described as “an art, not a science”. “It will be informed by an adaptive management method – try something which is approximately sensible based on the evidence and if you find it fails then ditch it and try something different,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4014f6fa721d030feb0281f4246da94be2eb4c96/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea55e4f1e90b96ea3c62876403138f23","title":"planning rules lifted for fairs markets and car boot sales in england","story":"Events can be held without planning permission under new laws designed to boost the economySummer fairs, outdoor markets and car boot sales can be held without planning permission in England, while alcohol will be widely available to take away, under what are designed to be new feel-good laws drawn up by ministers.Eating and drinking in pub and restaurant car parks will also be allowed when the business and planning bill is introduced tomorrow. The changes come ahead of what is being dubbed “Super Saturday” on 4 July, which will see the mass reopening of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and museums in a dramatic easing of coronavirus lockdown measures.The new laws are part of a series of government policies designed to help people socialise and reinvigorate the economy this summer. But serious fears remain over the risk of a second wave of Covid-19, especially amid crowds where physical distancing is impossible, as well as the impact on workers.Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said: “We have to bear in mind that for a lot of people they won’t have confidence about going to restaurants and bars. It also won’t be the same experience so we shouldn’t see the reopening as a panacea for things getting back to normal.”It comes as Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told MPs that plans for “air bridges” to allow quarantine-free travel abroad are gathering pace.He told the Commons transport select committee that there would be an announcement to parliament on Monday 29 June, with criteria and clarification on how they would operate.Shapps expects to speak to representatives from the devolved nations in coming days. Wales’ current five-mile restriction on travel – which would make it difficult for many to travel to an airport – will be discussed.New elements added to the business and planning bill, to be announced tomorrow, are designed to help businesses serve more customers outside and increase street trading. As well as summer fairs, car boot sales and outdoor markets not requiring planning permission, measures will be taken to help English councils pedestrianise streets so these events can be set up easily, the government said.Temporary changes to licensed premises will allow people to take drinks off-site, something which is typically banned in England through town by-laws.On Wednesday, sector-by-sector guidance for 4 July reopenings was issued, necessitating separate facilities for household groups in hotels and hostels, the use of screens and regular cleaning. Hair salons have been urged to keep the volume of piped music low to avoid customers and staff needing to shout, which creates an increased Covid-19 risk.Ahead of the hospitality sector opening its doors however, Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), warned that the new guidance was creating “chaos and confusion”.“For our sector, 4 July might end up being more ‘doomsday’ rather than the ‘independence day’ that the prime minister is envisioning,” he said.“We are now grappling with operational guidance that places unworkable conditions on customer behaviour. This will make it highly challenging for the businesses to re-engage, meaning many venues will simply be unable to open and trade profitably,” he said.Trades unions complained that, unlike the reopening of other sectors, they had not been consulted on the new regime for the hospitality sector.The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: “The governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all working closely with trade unions to keep workers safe.“England’s workers deserve the same commitment so it is totally baffling that the Westminster government will not accept Unite’s offer to use our standing army of health and safety reps to help with safe reopening of the economy.”The TUC has also raised concerns about whether the new guidance is enforceable.Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, is asking for more funding for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to carry out checks to make sure workplaces are safe.Boris Johnson’s spokesman said it will be up to local authorities and the HSE to police the new guidance under existing legislation that allows them to close premises and levy fines if safety is being put at risk.Police will retain the power to break up “irresponsible” gatherings of more than 30 people – though there will be nothing to stop pubs or other venues serving more than 30 customers, provided they abide by physical distancing rules.Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union, said he was disappointed with the Conservatives announcing the new “1 metre-plus” rule without meaningful consultation with workers who will be staffing pubs, restaurants and cafes, and working on food assembly lines.He said the union was also unhappy with the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, for accepting the rule change.He said: “It’s the people that have been missing from this announcement. It might suit the business lobby and it shows the pubs have a very powerful business lobby but workers haven’t been consulted.”The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, criticised the government for reopening the hospitality industry on a Saturday.“I would say that they have just come down on the side of risk, rather than caution, on the side of the economy rather than health,” he told Sky News.“The plan to open everything on a Saturday is, I think, a mistake, certainly unwise.”He added: “I am concerned about everything opening up on what Sky might dub ‘Super Saturday’.

This means levelling up communities who have felt left behind and truly delivering for every region and nation of the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c6d89db012c1984ecc8134e2b1ad772b039202f/70_66_4708_2826/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5d9ad3b959d9dfd195142fa657fb964","title":"moscows victory day parade in pictures","story":"Russia is holding its postponed Victory Day military parade despite rising coronavirus infections.

This perception must rapidly be deactivated.”Turkey has witnessed an increase in the daily number of infections after the government authorised cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen and eased stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June.The country has been registering average daily infections of around 1,260 since 12 June, up from around 800 to 900 previously.Koca on Wednesday reported 1,492 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total infections registered in the country since March to 191,657.

The change could send some of them back to their jobs.It was prompted by a cluster of farmworkers who tested positive but were all asymptomatic, said Ontario’s chief medical officer of health David Williams. “As we learn more, we change things, we adapt,” he told a briefing in Toronto.The United Arab Emirates’ government has lifted its curfew, it has announced. “All members of society are allowed to freely enter and exit throughout the day without restrictions,” it said in an announcement also tweeted by the country’s National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority.The Mexican health authorities are trying to understand how a set of newborn triplets became infected even though neither of their parents tested positive. Health authorities called the case “unheard of”.The triplets, a girl and two boys, were tested four hours after being born last week in the central state San Luis Potosi, health authorities said.Initially, health authorities said the mother was believed to be an asymptomatic carrier. But her tests later showed that neither she nor the father were infected.The number of deaths in France has risen by 11 to 29,731 on Wednesday, down sharply from Tuesday when the weekly data for nursing homes were included. That is the lowest increase in fatalities in five days. France’s death toll is the fifth-highest in the world.The US has suffered 784 more deaths and recorded 34,313 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has said. That takes the respective totals to 121,117 and 2,336,615.Here are the latest key developments in our global coronavirus coverage so far on Wednesday:And that’s it from me, Damien Gayle, for the day. The World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said he expects the number of coronavirus cases around the world, now at approximately 9.3 million, to reach 10 million next week. Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO emergencies programme, said the pandemic for many countries in the Americas had not yet peaked, and that it was ‘still intense’, especially in Central and South America.Ireland is set to become the latest European country to launch a voluntary phone-tracking app next week to alert users if someone they have been in contact with develops Covid-19, the head of its health service operator said, Reuters reports.  Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) announced plans to roll out the phone app in late March, just as the country went into lockdown, and initially expected it to be launched within 10 days.  HSE’s chief executive, Paul Reid, told a news conference on Wednesday that it has been approved by Ireland’s data protection agency and was awaiting final signoff by the government.  So far, 1,720 people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, which has had a manual contact-tracing programme in place since its outbreak began at the end of February.  The number of confirmed cases has fallen to an average of 11 a day over the past week as the economy prepares to almost fully reopen next week, with just 37 patients in hospital compared to a peak of nearly 900 that threatened to overwhelm the health service in mid-April.  Ireland will adopt a decentralised model for its tracing app where the data will be held on the person’s mobile phone and not centrally by the health service, which authorities hope will alleviate privacy concerns.  “We’ve done our own research in the early stages of the trial, there is pretty much a positive pick-up, that people feel they will use it and would use it in the future. We’d be strongly encouraged by that,” Reid said. In South Africa, nervous volunteers were also receiving some of the first injections of an experimental coronavirus vaccine on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The large-scale trial of the vaccine is being conducted in South Africa, Britain and Brazil (see previous post).South Africa has nearly one-third of Africa’s confirmed cases with more than 106,000, including more than 2,100 deaths. The country reported its biggest one-day death toll so far on Tuesday, with 111 new fatalities recorded.“I feel a little bit scared but I want to know what is going on with this vaccine so that I can tell my friends and others what is going on with the study,” one of the vaccine trial volunteers, Junior Mhlongo, said in Johannesburg."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4286758.1592941377!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin cafe opens three weeks ahead of covid 19 restrictions easing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFegan’s 1924 Cafe is on  Chancery Street, a short walk from the Four Courts. Photograph: Google Street ViewA cafe located behind Dublin’s Four Courts has been operating a sit-in service for almost three weeks ahead of the permitted reopening of cafes and restaurants next week.Fegan’s 1924 Cafe on Chancery Street, 200m from Bridewell Garda station, is allowing customers to use its indoor tables, despite the cafe and restaurant sector being restricted to operating take-away services until June 29th under coronavirus regulations.Cafe owner James Fegan said he was providing a service particularly for barristers who would have “nowhere else to go” if the cafe was not available to them. He said gardaí had also been using the cafe’s toilets when it was not practical for them to return to the Garda station.Mr Fegan said he had operated a take-away service for approximately six weeks but was now in his third week of providing an indoor service, in line with 2m distancing of tables and a strict hygiene and cleaning regime.“About 85 per cent of our business comes out of the Four Courts. We would get a lot of legal eagles in here, people giving advice to clients. They haven’t got the space in the courts and we would be the closest place for them to use a table. The likes of barristers would have nowhere else to go.”Mr Fegan said he was only allowing regular customers to sit in, with those he did not know being restricted to take away only.“During the Gemma O’Doherty and John Waters case there were some protesters who wanted to come in, but we didn’t allow that. I have no problem with protesters but we didn’t know them. But we did have guards in using the toilet at that time.”Mr Fegan said his business differed from a standard cafe or restaurant in that it was part of a cash and carry.“The cash and carry and wholesale business has continued all the way through, so given we were here anyway we thought we might as well keep the cafe business going.”Health and safetyThe cafe is “fully sanitised” at the start of every morning and before and after lunch, while the tables and chairs are cleaned after every sitting, Mr Fegan said. Staff had undergone health and safety training, including training on how to reassure customers who might be nervous to return to cafes.As he had opened ahead of the official date of June 29th, he had been asked to advise other cafes and restaurants ahead of their reopening next week. Mr Fegan said he had not been asked by the Garda or any other authority to stop serving customers indoors.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287489.1593013152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools set to reopen next month without social distancing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh said strict social distancing requirements were ‘neither practical nor possible’ for a summer programme across more than 200 schools.

This gives us time to continue to consult with the public health experts to develop and plan appropriate guidance.”Among the plans to support the reopening of all schools in late August include on-line training on safety measures for schools, parents and students additional resources for enhanced cleaning and hand-sanitisers for every classroom to be provided by the department.However, Solidarity and People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the Government was trying to “ put a square peg in a round hole” by squeezing students into some of the most overcrowded classes in the EU while striving for physical distancing.He said splitting classes and hiring additional teachers was the only safe way to reopen schools.Separately, Mr McHugh said in excess of 200 schools have registered to run a summer education programme for students with special needs, while 9,200 children have registered for home-based programmes.In addition, a further 210 disadvantaged or Deis primary schools have expressed an interest to participate a summer camp for students towards the end of August. At second level, 14 schools have registered with a number of others considering participating in the programme. “It is fantastic to see this level of response and it is a real demonstration of the commitment of local schools to their local communities,” Mr McHugh said.However, Sinn Féin’s education spokesman Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire said the numbers due to take part in the programme were only half of what had been projected for an “expanded” programme this year.He said a lack of clarity and uncertainty over the reopening of schools had contributed to confusion and uncertainty on the part of schools and parents and dented participation in the programme.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Friends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revoltMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transition"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287726.1593031802!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city traffic back to 75 of pre covid levels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRoad works continue on College Green, Dublin to removed a traffic lane and make cycling and walking in the city safer. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Traffic volumes in Dublin city have returned to 75 per cent of their pre-coronavirus levels, according to new figures from Dublin City Council.The number of vehicles travelling in and out of the city at morning and evening peak times began to drop rapidly from the first week in March, hitting a low at the end of the month when strict Covid-19 restrictions on travel were introduced.At that point, when travel was restricted to 2km except for essential reasons and most businesses were closed, traffic volumes fell to just over a third of their normal levels.However, despite no change to the restrictions over the following month, traffic crept back to more than 40 per cent of normal levels at the start of May.Since then, peak-time traffic has risen steadily as travel and business restrictions have eased, with the largest jump seen from the start to the middle of this month when most shops in the city centre reopened.At the end of the first week in June, traffic was at about 60 per cent of its pre-pandemic volumes and by June 21st, it had hit 75 per cent.The rise in traffic has been matched by calls from the public for a reallocation of roadspace to cyclists and pedestrians.Since April the council has been gradually implementing a Covid-19 “mobility intervention programme”.Parking spaces and loading bays have been annexed for pedestrians, and segregated cyclepaths, protected by bollards, have been installed at a number of locations, including the Liffey quays.The council is also phasing traffic out of College Green. In recent weeks flower boxes were installed in front of the Bank of Ireland on the northbound side of the Green to protect cycling facilities from traffic.While, on Wednesday morning the bus-stop lane on the opposite side of the road, from Trinity College to Church Lane, has been reallocated for footpath space. Buses will now stop in what is an existing traffic lane, leaving one lane for traffic.More than 700 requests for “mobility measures” including footpath widening, more space at bus stops, segregated cycling facilities, and contraflow cycle lanes have been made to the council since April.Meanwhile councillors were told on Wednesday it would take 100 years to resurface the city’s roads at the current levels of investment.Government funding for the maintenance of the city’s 1,250km of roads has fallen from €7.65 million in 2011 to €5.78 million this year.Over the same period road construction costs have increased by 50 per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

This will provide a vital boost to the domestic hospitality industry in lieu of international tourism numbers being restored.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287705.1593031228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donohoe expected to bid for presidency of eurogroup","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe:  the deadline for candidacies is on Thursday.

It’s a gamble,” said one EU official. “But if he runs, he would be a serious candidate.”Mr Donohoe is thought to have wide support as a potential compromise candidate among Eurogroup members, as Ireland is viewed as a middle-ground country that straddles Europe’s north-south isions on economic matters.The job involves forging consensus in the informal but powerful group and would come at a crucial time ahead of an expected downturn across the EU.Coalition formationThe campaign by Spain’s deputy prime minister for the economy, Nadia Calviño, has already kicked off, and Mr Donohoe’s supporters in Europe have been forced to grapple with the complexities of Irish coalition formation in recent days in an attempt to understand whether his candidacy is certain.Luxembourg’s finance minister, Pierre Gramegna, has also been named as a potential contender for the job.Leaders Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan will meet on Thursday to discuss the allocation of ministerial portfolios.If Mr Donohoe applies for the Eurogroup position, it will be taken as an indication that he is confident he will stay in the Department of Finance.Such a scenario would likely see Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath become minister for public expenditure and reform, with Mr Donohoe and Mr McGrath swapping roles when Mr Varadkar takes over as taoiseach from Mr Martin in 2022.Voting is due to take place on July 9th, by which time Mr Donohoe’s position as finance minister will need to be clear, for him to have a chance of success.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287674.1593029084!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party rejects bogue s claim she was suspended after criticising leader","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLorna Bogue claims she was suspended from the Green Party because her criticisms about party leader Eamon Ryan (above)  were put to him on Prime Time.

I’m still none the wiser.”A party spokesman denied the suggestion, saying Mr Ryan had never made any complaint about, or initiated any action against, or questioned the right of, any Green member to comment in the public domain during his time in the party.The spokesman said the temporary suspension was based on a number of issues, including a complaint made about comments she had made on internal WhatsApp messages.Interviewed by Sarah McInerney on RTÉ radio, Ms Bogue said that in the WhatsApp groups “the way female members had been treated was very unkind”. She said those comments formed the entire basis of the complaint.That was disputed by the party, which said the complaint from another party member was more substantive than that, and was not based solely on the comment as related by Ms Bogue on the radio.That issue is now the subject of an internal inquiry within the party.Ms Bogue also said one person on the party’s executive council had argued against lifting her suspension. Mr Ryan is a member of the council.“You don’t have to be Colleen Rooney to figure out what was going on here,” she said.SexismMs Bogue also contended there was sexism in the party and it would not allow her as a young woman to have an opinion.She said once she began speaking against the grain, a “witchhunt” had begun.In response, the party said it had always strived to give equal weight to female and male voices, and was concerned and saddened to hear allegations of sexism within the organisation.“The majority of senior officer roles in the party are held by women. The the ratio of male and female representatives in the party is close to 5050,” it said.This comes as the party has been riven by an increasingly bitter internal debate over the decision to negotiate a programme for government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, where many of its members feel hurt and victimised.Ms Bogue was not reachable for comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287750.1593034811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"masks are to be mandatory on public transport","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man travels on a bus wearing a face mask in central London.

Minister for Transport Shane Ross is set to bring the compulsory mask proposals to Thursday’s Cabinet meeting. Ministers have insisted masks will become more important as coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The two metre social distancing rule for public transport operators will cease to apply and, instead, operators will be allowed to run at 50 per cent capacity.Mr Ross, in what is expected to be the Government’s last Cabinet meeting, will recommend that regulations be changed to enforce the new rule.The issue was discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting on Wednesday and it is expected the mandatory mask rule will take effect in the next week or two.The Government is also set to move to open “air bridges” between Ireland and other countries which have brought coronavirus under control. This would allow for the two-week quarantine period to be lifted for those arriving into Ireland from such areas – allowing Irish tourists to go on foreign holidays to certain destinations. It is not yet clear if the “air bridges” will apply only to countries within the EU or for those outside it too. It is expected the changes will be brought in from July 9th. While no decision has been taken about easing the two metre rule at airports, one source said: “It is not really working now.” Ministers are also expected to provide a bailout for Shannon Airport.Second wave Meanwhile, an infectious diseases consultant will on Thursday warn the Oireachtas about a second wave of Covid-19 and call on the Government for greater investment over the coming weeks “to rapidly upscale in emergency department capacity and isolation room facilities”.Prof Paddy Mallon from St Vincent’s Hospital and UCD will tell the Covid-19 special committee that as society reopens, the public is handing back some responsibility for controlling the virus to the State and if the programme of testing and tracing “fails to work effectively, we risk losing the gains provided to us through the sacrifices of the Irish people”.He will say there is “a very narrow window of opportunity” to learn from the lessons of the first wave and that this time must be used “wisely to improve our infrastructure”.The HSE’s chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry, will tell the committee a critical project for a new model of contact tracing and testing that will operate for the next 18 months will have a target implementation date in late August. Meanwhile, the Minister for Education said a summer programme would reopen next month for children with special needs without any requirement for strict social distancing. This move is seen as a significant trial run for the full reopening of all schools in the autumn.Elsewhere, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said the Garda had “found itself again” during the pandemic because gardaí were freed from a range of “ancillary tasks” that always fell to the force but which had “nothing to do” with its official role. “There are functions we should be shedding,” he told the Policing Authority on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287689.1593031537!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sensible approach needed on distancing in churches says harris","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn perhaps his last speech to the Dáil as Minister for Health Simon Harris said the reproduction rate at which an infected person passes on the virus to someone else remained stable. File photograph: Collins Minister for Health Simon Harris has told the Dáil that common sense should prevail in the guidelines offered on social distancing in churches.The National Public Health Emergency Team will reconsider on Thursday the question of numbers in places of worship after criticism of guidelines that churches could only resume services with a maximum of 50 people in attendance.Mr Harris told Fine Gael TD Frankie Feighan who raised the matter that “it is an issue where common sense should prevail”.Mr Feighan said people were deeply disturbed that churches would only be allowed to resume Masses provided there were no more than 50 people. He said this “makes no sense whatsoever” because some churches are very large.Mr Harris said he and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had asked the public health emergency team to look at the matter again.“I know how much their faith matters to many people” who are looking forward to returning to their church.“We don’t want anyone getting sick at Mass or church or their place or worship” but many churches were large and “common sense needs to prevail”.What next after Covid-19Mr Harris also told the Dáil the Sláintecare office is considering priorities for this year and next in light of the challenges posed by Covid-19. “It is very clear that the reforms under the programme will be necessary, more than ever,” he said.In possibly his last speech to the Dáil as Minister for Health Mr Harris also said the reproduction rate at which a person infected with coronavirus passes it on to someone else remained stable at between 0.5 and 0.8. But because of the low number of cases the “more important number” to monitor is the number of new cases per day and where they are emerging.“The average number of cases over the last five days was nine. This day last week, it was 19.”He also has signalled that the lifting of travel restrictions will go ahead on Monday because “we have worked hard to suppress this virus and we look in a strong position to progress”.He said the Government “will decide how to proceed tomorrow afternoon” following the public health emergency team meeting.The Minister said he hoped that many people would see relatives they had not seen for many months because they lived in other parts of the country.In May 85,000 outpatient appointments were dealt with virtually via online GP consultations and prescriptions sent electronically to pharmacies.He said “better infection control measures, more and better alternatives to hospitals, healthcare supports in our nursing homes, keeping people in their homes for longer” are “no longer options but absolute necessities”.He warned of the delays in “donning and doffing of equipment, significant additional time for cleaning of beds, theatres and equipment” and enhanced PPE and cleaning between patients.“Patients booked for surgery will require to be tested prior to surgery. The health service we know will be no more and we must reconstruct it safely and dynamically.”Social distancingThe Dáil also heard Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly warn that infection-control measures will seriously reduce the capacity to treat patients. Surgeons estimate seeing about half the number of patients in some cases in a given operating theatre.There could also be a reduction in capacity of up to 80 per cent for “more invasive diagnostics like scopes”, he said.Sinn Féin health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly said the Taoiseach was wrong and “he should apologise” for “trying to contradict” figures on the infection rates among healthcare workers.On Tuesday INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said Ireland had the highest infection rates of healthcare workers anywhere in the world.Ms O’Reilly said “no country uses the infection rate as a percentage of the healthcare workforce. That is not how it is managed. Internationally speaking we do have the highest infection rates in the world.”She added that Ms Ní Sheaghdha and her members and healthcare workers who have contracted the virus are “owed an apology”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"The decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287684.1593028168!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the eu s biggest obstacle may be the dutch parliament","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t French president Emmanuel Macron, left, and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte speak in a restaurant after a meeting in The Hague. Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw EPAPublicity shots of the meeting showed Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and French president Emmanuel Macron seated happily beside each other at a candlelit dining table set for two.The pair were taking advantage of the recently reopened restaurants of The Hague on Macron’s visit to the Netherlands this week: one of the first physical meetings between leaders in the EU since the coronavirus pandemic shut down normal life.The French leader’s mission was to try to make a dent in Dutch resistance to a recovery plan aimed at rescuing the European Union from deep economic damage caused by the pandemic. And it may take more than a friendly dinner to do so.The rescue plan was pioneered by France and Germany, and has been a subject of debate among the EU member states since it was formally proposed by the European Commission a month ago.It involves borrowing by the EU’s executive and distribution of funds to member states that does not need to be paid back: a generous approach to the downturn and a step towards common borrowing that some regard as a breakthrough in EU unity and a potential redress of one of the structural problems of the euro.But the Netherlands, as the leader of the EU’s so-called “Frugal Four”, has been heading up resistance to the plan, as it opposes anything that involves increased cost to the bloc’s stronger economies or smacks of taking on responsibility for debt incurred by others.The four, including Austria, Denmark and Sweden, have called for a “realistic level of spending” and want member states to be obliged to pay back any funds they receive.For many years The Hague leaned on Germany to advocate tight economic policies in the bloc. But a recognition of the unprecedented nature of the current challenge, a sense that the EU needs a demonstration of solidarity to shore up unity, and an increasing belief that the time for austerity has passed has shifted attitudes in Berlin and beyond.Not far away from where Macron and Rutte spoke stood what may be the plan’s greatest obstacle: the Dutch parliament.The Netherlands is heading for an election due in March next year, and that makes it a difficult time to extract Dutch political compromises.Far-right euroscepticism has long been the tail that wagged the dog of Dutch politics. For two decades anti-immigration and Brussels-bashing politicians have gnawed at the support of the centre-ground in the Netherlands, forcing natural moderates like Rutte into harder positions and mainstreaming a negative view of the bloc, despite the Dutch economy’s profound reliance on the single market.One key element of the recovery plan – the proposal that the European Commission should be allowed to raise its own funds through taxes such as a digital or carbon levy to pay back the rescue funds – would need to be approved by national parliaments.Campaigning opportunityA YesNo vote on an EU issue would be an ideal campaigning opportunity for right-wing anti-immigration parties such as Thierry Baudet’s Forum for Democracy, or the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders, though these days he is very much a weakened force.Baudet was a key campaigner in driving the Netherlands’ 2016 referendum on whether to approve an EU association agreement with Ukraine, a tokenistic topic that was used as a wedge issue to mobilise the eurosceptic base and deliver a bloody nose to Rutte and Brussels with a 64 per cent rejection of the treaty on a razor-thin turnout.The Dutch electorate is anything but uniform. It is fragmented into an array of groups from a party for the over-50s to the famous Party for the Animals, and, in the last election, the EU-friendly D66 and Greens increased their vote share, albeit while still emerging only the fourth and fifth largest parties in parliament.Yet so potent and ingrained is a Dutch grumpiness towards the EU, alongside a British-style conviction that the bloc should remain a quid-pro-quo arrangement of economic advantage rather than a union of broader interests, that even nominally pro-EU parties sometimes temper their positions on the issue.One of D66’s defining positions is its support for the EU. But the party joined the Dutch majority to vote against the idea of euro bonds in April after a group of nine countries including Ireland called for them.The recovery plan, which proposes once-off borrowing by the commission to be repaid by granting the executive body the ability to raise its own money, is not the leap forward in integration that euro bonds would be. But it is a step forward, and the Dutch electorate may not allow their parliament to budge an inch.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Only under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287137.1592977840!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu asks united states to reconsider covid 19 travel ban","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump speaks with Rodney Scott, the US Border Patrol Chief, as he tours a section of the border wall on Tuesday in Arizona. Photograph: APThe European Union has stepped up efforts to persuade the United States to exempt EU citizens legally residing in the US from the travel ban, as both sides consider the next stage in opening-up borders for international travel in the wake of coronavirus.In a letter to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last week, EU ambassador Stavros Lambrinidis and Croatia’s ambassador to the US, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, asked the US to reconsider the scope of the current travel ban imposed by the US in March to take account of Europeans living in the US on non-immigrant visas.Thousands of Europeans are employed under various categories of so-called “non-immigrant” visas in the US, but under the terms of the travel ban which applies to most European countries, China and Iran, they are unable to re-enter the United States if they visit those countries.The European Commission already offers more flexibility to non-EU nationals, and has recommended that third-country nationals, including Americans, legally residing in the EU should be exempt from travel restrictions.Ban on visasOn Monday, US president Donald Trump announced a ban on issuing new non-immigrant visas to foreign workers for the rest of the year, though those who are already living and working in the United States on visas are not affected. However, the presidential order means that thousands of people who had expected to travel to the United States for work later in 2020 will be unable to do so.Discussions between inidual embassies and the EU mission in Washington are taking place with the administration and the State Department on possible exemptions to the travel restrictions or a standardised approach by the two blocs. Other categories of foreign residents in the United States are permitted to re-enter, though they must abide by quarantine and other health requirements in each state on their return. In the letter, the ambassadors point out that current US coronavirus travel rules mean that EU citizens resident in the United States are banned from entering the US if travelling from the Schengen area or Ireland.The diplomatic push comes amid reports that the EU could ban US travellers from entering the Schengen area as it considers taking a coordinated approach among member states to reopening the bloc’s external borders from July 1st.The US has reported more than 2.3 million cases – the highest in the world – with top immunologist Anthony Fauci warning on Tuesday of a “disturbing surge” in infection rates in some US states.One possibility is that both blocs could maintain restrictions on tourist visitors, but have different arrangements for those ordinarily resident in either the EU or the US.Less than five months before the presidential election, immigration is returning to the political agenda in the United States.Border wallMr Trump toured a section of the border wall in Arizona yesterday, as he made a trip to the electorally-important state.Stating that illegal immigration was down 84 per cent compared to a year ago – a figure that has been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic – Mr Trump said that no administration had done more to secure America’s southern border.“Our border has never been more secure,” he said, accusing presidential rival Joe Biden and Democrats of wanting “open borders” and “criminal sanctuaries”.Mr Trump inspected a section of a 320km segment of the steel wall, signing a plaque attached to the barrier. Earlier, he described the structure as “just about unclimbable”, and “the most powerful” barrier in the world.Mr Trump’s visit to Arizona came a day after he signed a presidential order expanding immigration restrictions, by halting the issuance of new visas for certain categories of foreign workers until the end of the year. He also extended a ban on green card applications until at least next year. Speaking at the border wall on Tuesday, Mr Trump defended the move, stating: “we want to give jobs to Americans right now”. But he hinted that some breakthrough on DACA – the programme that protects young Americans who arrived in the country illegally as children – could be imminent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

Amazon unveiled the new Counterfeit Crimes Unit on Tuesday, and said it would be “dedicated to bringing counterfeiters to justice”.However, a charity which has called for new laws to protect consumers online said the unit should not be limited to intellectual property breaches, but should also target potentially unsafe electrical goods.Amazon’s team is made of former federal prosecutors, experienced investigators and data analysts and the firm said its aim is to “drive counterfeit to zero”.Dharmesh Mehta, Vice President Worldwide Customer, Trust and Partner Support at the firm, said: “Every counterfeiter is on notice that they will be held accountable to the maximum extent possible under the law, regardless of where they attempt to sell their counterfeits or where they’re located.”Amazon said that in 2019 it invested more than $500m (£403m) and had more than 8,000 employees fighting fraud on its platform.In May, Amazon said it passed information on counterfeiters to authorities in 12 countries, including the UK.Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First, said that the unit should go further and tackle the “scourge” of substandard electrical goods.She added: “This new unit must put consumer safety at its center and prove it is more than a business relations exercise to protect brands.”A spokesman for Amazon said: Safety is a top priority at Amazon.

And if, as official data currently suggests, China is able to keep future outbreaks of Covid-19 under control, then it will no doubt look to capitalise wherever possible for its own economic, commercial, and political advantage.  The existential threat facing the EU, meanwhile, cannot be underestimated. Although we have seen the EU bounce from crisis to crisis over the past 10 years, it seems that, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic – ironically a crisis originating almost certainly in China – the decisions the EU takes now will be a defining moment for the future of European integration. This combination of a China looking to exert and strengthen its global power and a Europe battling for its very survival has sadly created a truly perfect storm. And it is Italy – which was one of the EU’s most struggling countries financially pre-Covid-19, and which has been arguably the hardest hit by the virus – that sits firmly in the eye of this storm.As Italy faces its most severe crisis since the Second World War, with more than 35,000 Covid-19 deaths and its economy on course to suffer the deepest recession in modern history, there is a rising feeling within the country that it is being abandoned by its neighbours. China, meanwhile, is clearly looking for a major “satellite” in Europe, or, more politely, for a more permanent entry-point to the continent. And Italy would appear to be an obvious choice. As one of the G7 advanced economies and the second-largest manufacturer in the EU, it would be quite a catch. Put bluntly, Italy’s feelings of betrayal by its European partners, Germany in particular, seem to coincide  unfortunately with Chinese attempts to deepen its penetration of Europe. And an Italy reeling from the fallout from coronavirus, and from previous woes, may, by providing China with a willing partner on the continent, be the weak link in the EU’s approach to Beijing and to the defence more generally of European values.We have witnessed this crisis magnify the economic and political isions between northern and southern Europe that have long threatened to tear apart the EU.When Italy appealed to the rest of the EU for assistance, it was initially rebuffed. Italy, and the rest of southern Europe, had hoped for a real demonstration of solidarity from the rest of the EU early in the pandemic. And even if the EU has subsequently increased assistance in the form of financial aid and equipment, the initial hopes and expectations were by no means met. Last month, the new European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, tacitly admitted this, offering Italy a “heartfelt apology” for not having done more to help.But was this act of contrition too late? With regards to Italy in particular, it is a situation that has been brewing for quite some time. Italy’s economy has barely grown since the launch of the euro in 1999. “Reforms” were imposed on the country during the financial crisis and it has seen its status as one of the “big three” founder-members of the EU, alongside France and Germany, effectively downgraded.A migrant crisis in which, again, Italy was hit hard and the EU faced accusations of a lack of solidarity, merely added to the resentment. It is, therefore, unsurprising that, long before coronavirus was a word on most people’s lips, Italy last year signed up to China’s Belt and Road initiative, a hugely ambitious scheme to drive trade links via infrastructure projects from the Far East into the heart of Europe. It was the first major Western country to do so.Perhaps fittingly, an early symbol of Italian participation in this scheme was to be found in Chinese involvement in the deep-water port city of Trieste in the Adriatic, once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and ceded to Italy after it joined the Allies during the First World War. Trieste has long been considered the European terminus of the maritime Silk Road from the Far East to Europe, a key trade route for about 2,000 years until the 1700s, which is thought to be a key inspiration for the Belt and Road project.Of course, European partnership with China is not confined to Italy. George Osborne, Chancellor from 2010 to 2016, ignored US opposition and signed the UK up for Beijing’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, widely seen as a rival to the Washington-based World Bank. Neither is Italy alone in feeling bruised by its treatment by its EU partners after bearing the initial brunt of the coronavirus crisis. Spain harbours similar feelings of neglect.Nevertheless, it is Italy that will surely be the immediate battleground for any clash of ideas and ideals between China and the EU. And unless bold action is taken by northern European countries, there is a very real risk of Italy turning its back on the European project forever and potentially turning to China. The EU must take significant measures to support and protect both Italy and wider EU integration. As Donald Tusk, now president of the European People’s Party, notes: “We must save Italy, Spain and the whole of Europe and not be afraid of extraordinary measures. This is a state of emergency.” Italy itself must also look to do everything it can to be as attractive as possible to foreign investors and businesses. There must not be overwhelming bureaucracy or an ineffective legal system preventing investment into the Italian economy. Reform in these areas – in Italy and across southern Europe generally – is long overdue and cannot be delayed any longer. We must hope that EU leaders and their Western allies take action now. They will not get a second chance – especially as an opportunistic China lurks in these unchartered waters. Nicole Junkermann is the founder of NJF Holdings, an international investment companyMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont look now britains v shaped economic recovery has already","story":"The economic recovery is already taking shape nicely – and the shape looks increasingly like a V after all. Despite this, many commentators are still pessimistic and even eager to emphasise the downside risks. It is time to view the glass as half full instead.Let us start with what we already know. The economy shrank by an unprecedented 25 per cent in just two months between February and April, but it could have been even worse. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s projections for the public finances are still based on a 35 per cent fall in GDP, sustained for a full three months. The Bank of England had warned of a 30 per cent decline.What’s more, there is now ample evidence that April was indeed the trough, and that activity picked up sharply in both May and June, even while large parts of the economy were still in lockdown. This evidence includes surveys of business activity, such as the Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs) published by Markit. The handful of official numbers released so far have generally been better than expected too, including a 12 per cent jump in retail sales last month.Indeed, both the OBR and the Chief Economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, have now acknowledged that the economy is performing less badly than either had predicted. Even the record level of Government borrowing is slightly below the path that the OBR had pencilled in.Of course, it is still too much to hope for a neatly symmetrical V-shaped recovery, where GDP returns to its pre-crisis level as quickly as it fell. But the latest data suggest that the UK economy should get back close to this level much sooner than many had anticipated, and the picture will look far more like a V than the U, or even L, that some had feared.Indeed, I’d go further and say that an initial V is now nailed on. Some people will understandably be reluctant to venture out and spend, even if they are allowed to do so. But the latest polling suggest that a clear majority of the public support the further easing of the lockdown.In the meantime, some households have been hit disproportionately hard, including many poorer families and the self-employed. Many of those on the Government’s furlough scheme are worried about losing their jobs when it ends. Nonetheless, most households have actually built up their savings during the lockdown. Pent-up demand is therefore still likely to be strong.So, why the continuing pessimism? In part this may reflect several biases, some of which are more forgivable than others: bad news usually sells better than good news, many commentators are reluctant to appear complacent in the midst of a pandemic and may simply want to see more evidence, while others would never want to appear to give any credit to a Government led by Boris Johnson.But to be fair to the pessimists, there is also still a chance that the initial V-shaped recovery is just the first stage of a W. This double dip scenario could come about for one or both of two reasons.First, there could be a devastating second wave of the coronavirus itself. This would presumably force the Government to reimpose the lockdown, or at least prompt many consumers and businesses to behave as if it had. Others are better qualified than me to judge the likelihood of this happening, although most of what I have seen suggests that this risk is now small and that the UK is much better prepared than it was in March.Second, the rise in unemployment so far might only be the tip of a very large iceberg. It is certainly possible that many more job losses will follow in the coming months as the furlough scheme is wound down. But again, I think it right to be relatively optimistic.Crucially, the further easing of the lockdown is running well ahead of the timetable for scaling back the employment subsidies. There is also still more that the Government could do, should this be needed. However, the UK’s relatively flexible economy and labour market is pretty good at creating jobs on its own, if allowed to do so.In short, ever since the early days of the coronavirus crisis, pundits have been debating how quickly activity would rebound when the lockdown is lifted, or indeed whether it could recover at all. Thus far, the evidence points to a pleasant surprise.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive destinations first set air bridges uk revealed","story":"Air bridges with a series of short-haul destinations are set to be unveiled at the weekend as the Government plots a three-stage approach to revive flying.The first tranche of bridges are expected to be with popular low-risk holiday destinations including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany, largely to re-fire the Mediterranean tourist industry from July 4, according to sources.Portugal is not expected to be included after its spike in coronavirus rates, but the bridges mean people going on holiday to the other destinations will not be required to quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK.Ministers hope the plan will enable families to start planning Mediterranean summer breaks to the most popular destinations this weekend.A larger second set of countries is expected to be unveiled next week, including other EU nations such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland along with low-risk Caribbean islands and La Reunion, a French department in the Indian Ocean, which Public Health England has identified as having minimal infections.Ministers are examining at least one long-haul air bridge to Australia, although there are difficulties over transiting in stop-over countries which could carry a risk of spreading coronavirus. Any traveller will be expected to ensure that any stop-overs are in nations with low coronavirus rates or risk having to self-isolate on their return to the UK.Ministers are also looking to open bridges to low-risk British territories including Gibraltar, Bermuda, Montserrat and the Falklands Islands as soon as possible. Even though the number of flights and demand is low, they are regarded as special cases.It is understood that countries in a third wave, such as Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong, have been told it is unlikely that air bridges will be established before late summer.The USA, where Donald Trump has closed the borders, is unlikely to be opened until after November, although that will depend on whether states can reduce their coronavirus rates.New Zealand is planning to keep its borders closed with a 14-day quarantine until March because of fears of a second winter wave of coronavirus. That may change if a vaccine is developed and proves effective by then.The UK bridges policy is expected to be finalised at a Covid-19 strategy meeting on Thursday with Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and Priti Patel, the Home Secretary.Mr Shapps is understood to have been pressing for a more ambitious, bigger opening of travel corridors in the initial phase, describing them on Wednesday as a massive priority to reinvigorate the aviation industry, help rebuild the economy and enable Britons to enjoy overseas summer sun.Foreign holiday bookings have risen by 52 per cent in two weeks, according to travelsupermarket. Seven out of 10 of the top destinations are in Spain.The criteria for deciding which countries, to be published on Monday, is focused on the virus infection rate, whether it is rising or falling and whether the prospective destination has a test and trace system to limit any outbreaks and social distancing rules as strict as the UK\u0027s.It will be set against their popularity as destinations for Britons and the economic case, which could mean dozens of countries in the first two waves.Mr Shapps told MPs on Wednesday: You can see there are a lot  of complexities. I don\u0027t want to be evasive but I don\u0027t also want to give people false hope, which is why I need to wait until the end of the process and wait until June 29.The European Commission has warned that it would be discriminatory to allow travel corridors between some but not all EU countries with similar low-risk coronavirus profiles. Backbenchers are making similar pleas. Henry Smith, the chairman of the cross-party Future of Aviation group, said: I would like to see air corridors across the whole of the EU and Schengen area.The Department for Transport, however, argues that there is no legal impediment to bilateral deals. We would regard that as their problem. I don\u0027t think you can imagine Brussels trying to tell the Spanish: \u0027You can\u0027t take Britons, said a minister.The moves came as the airport ground handling company Swissport announced plans to cut more than 4,500 jobs. The Airport Operators\u0027 Association warned in a report on Wednesday of 20,000 job losses at airports and a further 100,000 in associated businesses.The International Air Transport Association (IATA), on Wednesday joined BA\u0027s parent company, Ryanair and Easyjet in a legal challenge to ditch quarantine because of the economic damage.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"patriotic duty go pub save one britains last great institutions","story":"An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a pub. Oh, those were the days!For a nation of boozers, the opening of the pubs next month brings glad tidings, and a dystopian “new normal”. Patrons could soon be queuing, supermarket-stye, outside, before listing their personal details on arrival (for contact-tracing purposes), navigating one-way systems and dodging hazmat-suited barmaids. They may order their G\u0026ampTs through apps, and sit inside perspex booths to drink them. Outside, social distancing Stasi could patrol the beer gardens for signs of non-compliance.Sounds terrible, doesn’t it? And yet, I miss the pub so much, I don’t even care. When they are finally liberated, I’m half-tempted to pack a deckchair and thermos, and queue up overnight, swathed in a Union Jack, like those starry-eyed monarchists at the Lindo Wing whenever a new royal baby arrives.The PM insists supporting pubs is a “patriotic duty”, and so it is – not because this timid Government says so, but because, through no fault of its own, a great British institution is in mortal peril. Pandemic, lockdown and excessive caution have conspired to create a situation so dire that we should assume many of our favourite watering holes will never resurface from this economic maelstrom, and spend as if their – and our – lives depended on it.Britain is home to a dizzying array of pubs, a rich ecosystem in which all have their place. There’s the old-fashioned sort, where scotch eggs and pickled onions mingle with a selection of real ales as long as the wine list at the Ritz. There’s the splendour of an oak-timbered gastropub, or the spartan charm of a cheap-and-cheerful joint offering £3 pints and nothing to eat but a few salted peanuts, with a dartboard and an invariably rude landlord who will, nevertheless, sanction a bit of indoor smoking after dark.The country pub is a separate but equally vital institution. Betjeman unkindly described the “village bores more sure to roam  To village pubs than stay at home”. But we bores must go somewhere and certainly, my parents’ local, the Cottage Tavern in Ashorne, has bolstered morale with takeaways and Sunday roasts, and helped coordinate a tight-knit hub of local volunteers.The truly “faultless” pub remains as elusive as George Orwell’s fictional inn the Moon Under Water, yet many treasure a pantheon of near-perfect pubs (for me this includes the Sloop Inn at Bantham, The Union Tavern in Westbourne Park, London, and The Trout Inn, at Godstow, just outside Oxford, with its peacocks and aura of danger from the thundering weir).Public houses have always fulfilled mankind’s need for sanctuary and belonging – not for nothing does the satanic monster Grendel target the mead-hall in Beowulf. They are secular churches, binding communities together. Along with the Army and the monarchy, the pub is one of our last great institutions at a time of overwhelming systemic failure. Allowing pubs to fold through Covid-based nanny statism and neglect would deprive our descendants of their rightful inheritance.The “new normal” may be clinical and unappealing, but we must sustain the great British pub until we can provide the rapturous homecoming it deserves.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"unlocking economy must governments top priority","story":"At last the Government has decided to start the process of unlocking the economy. The announcement by Boris Johnson on Tuesday was good news for us all.Critically, there has been a change in messaging around the two-metre social-distancing rule. It has been apparent for some time that this rule was out of place if we wanted to get the economy moving. If it had been maintained, restaurants and pubs would not have been able to reopen, because the cost would have outweighed the return. As one of the largest employers in the UK, their role in easing lockdown is vital. The two-metre rule has also affected the capabilities of schools and hospitals to function properly.I have for some weeks been calling on ministers to put forward their strategic plan and end the requirement to remain two metres apart. The evidence has been there for some time that, while the calculated risk of reducing the distance is very small, the rewards are enormous.Though I welcome the change, I was concerned that the process now looks a bit like grandma’s footsteps, with the scientists acting as grandma. Note how Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, left Tuesday’s press conference in no doubt that he remained unconvinced: it must be remembered that scientists disagree among themselves constantly about the data.The problem is that, since the lockdown, the messaging has been so threatening that the public have in many cases reached the conclusion that everyone is at equal risk from Covid-19. While I can understand the need for that as we locked down, the result is that people seem to have lost their natural sense of the balance of risks that govern our lives. The latest figures show that only some 5 to 10 per cent have died without any co-morbidities. We know that this is a disease that attacks the elderly and those weakened by other conditions, such as heart disease.Interestingly, according to Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, Britons under the age of 50 are more likely to die from an accident or injury, under-40s are more likely to die in a car accident and under-25s are more likely to die from flu or pneumonia, than from coronavirus. Since the lockdown, people’s ability to balance risk and reward has practically disappeared, as fear of the virus has gripped the nation. For example, I see people are now encouraged to get on their bikes to avoid public transport, but few realise that up to age 44 you are more likely to die from a cycling fatality than from Covid.The one-metre-plus rule has caused some confusion. Cinemas can open but not theatres, museums and galleries but not exhibition or conference centres, funfairs and theme parks but not swimming pools, and hairdressers but not nail bars or tanning salons. Finally, no cricket. Why does the Government see cricket balls as super spreaders but not tennis balls?It is vital that we get the social-distancing measure to one metre and the economy moving, or more than just the economy suffers a static economy risks more deaths.People remain concerned about going to hospital. Oncology Central calculates that up to 60,000 cancer patients could die unnecessarily. Some hospitals report that only  57 per cent of beds are occupied. There is still too much misunderstanding of the risk. After all, teachers have caused parents to worry about their children in school when we know young children are more likely to be struck by lightning than die from Covid-19.That’s why, after the cautious start, the Government now needs to make the case in a more positive tone with a simpler message: it must sell the reality that unlocking is vital and that the balance of risk and reward clearly favours the resumption of economic and social activity. Life must get back to as near to normal as possible if we are to avoid terrible consequences. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/19/16/squid-live.jpg","title":"antebellum trailer janelle monae release date","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Janelle\u0026nbspMonáe\u0026nbspfilm could be the sleeper hit of the yearMysterious new horror Antebellum provides an intriguing if challenging spin on the alternate reality genre.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The pound sterling has behaved more like the volatile currency of a developing country over the past four years since the Brexit referendum vote, according to an analysis by foreign exchange traders.Since the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016 the pound has suffered a record fall against the dollar, a rapid gain and then another precipitous slide to its weakest level in 35 years.The price swings of the currency have been notable, but Kamal Sharma and Myria Kyriacou of Bank of America also note that the “liquidity” of the currency – the difference between the rates at which traders are willing to buy and sell – seems worse than for other major currencies and that traders are also pricing in a higher risk of future volatility.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat really forces currency markets and exchange rates to change?Their research also suggests that during the coronavirus crisis only the Brazilian real has seen more volatility in foreign exchange futures markets than sterling.This has led them to argue that the UK’s currency should best be seen as an emerging market (EM) currency – such as South Africa’s rand or Turkey’s lira – rather than compared to traditional peers such as the US dollar or the euro or other members of the G10 group of industrialised economies.“A more bespoke view of the pound is required and one that would take an EM-esque view.”The Bank of America analysts are clear that the volatility of sterling in recent years has been largely driven by the result of the Brexit vote and they warn that this is likely to intensify, rather than fall away, as the UK formally leaves the bloc, with or without a trade deal, next year.“Brexit is likely to permanently alter the way in which investors view the pound,” they say.They also see the fiscal and economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis in the UK influencing the way the currency is traded.They see the government’s fiscal deficit at 6 per cent of GDP in 2021 and the current account – the amount the country as a whole borrows from abroad – at 4 per cent.

A second booster dose will be administered within four weeks.About 300 volunteers are taking part in the study, which is the second coronavirus vaccine trial on humans underway in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers at the University of Oxford began testing their vaccine candidate on people in April, and have enrolled more than 1,000 participants.Fifteen healthy volunteers are expected to receive their first dose in the coming days as part of the initial phase of the Imperial trial.The coronavirus crisis has thrust us into a new era of scienceOver 50s and key workers to be given priority for coronavirus vaccineProfessor Robin Shattock, from the university’s department of infectious disease, said: “We now eagerly await rapid recruitment to the trial so that we can assess both the safety of the vaccine and its ability to produce neutralising antibodies which would indicate an effective response against Covid-19.“I look forward to our progress in the coming months.”To assess safety as well as to find the optimal dosage, the researchers are starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it to higher doses for subsequent volunteers.Imperial’s RNA vaccine uses synthetic strands of genetic code based on the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.It works by delivering genetic instructions to muscle cells to make the “spike” protein on the surface of Sars-CoV-2. The presence of this protein provokes an immune response, offering protection against the virus.If the vaccine is safe and shows promising immune response, a further trial involving 6,000 people is expected to go ahead in October.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

has refused to reveal the details of the proposed deal that would allow chlorinated chicken into the UK – claiming the Americans might be listening.A “dual tariff” plan has been put forward to Donald Trump’s administration that would permit US food that does not meet current British standards, provided they paid higher levies.But, asked for the first time about the idea by a committee of MPs, trade secretary Liz Truss refused to discuss it – while twice ducking the opportunity to deny it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I’m not going to go into detail in this committee on our negotiating strategy, because I suspect our counterparties from across the Atlantic might be taking account of my comments,” she claimed.The comment was made despite it being widely accepted that the proposal has already been made to Washington, in detailed talks continuing this week.Johnson confronted over claim no country has working coronavirus appEarlier this month, No 10 dropped a pledge to maintain bans on both chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef, as talks towards a trade deal with Washington ramp up.Ministers have been accused of risking the greatest risk to food safety since mad cow disease 20 years ago, undermining “a food safety revolution” that protected British shoppers.The comments also came after a separate committee accused ministers of drawing a “veil of secrecy” over decision-making after Brexit, MPs having been shut out of scrutinising trade deals.Put under pressure by the Commons international trade committee, Ms Truss came out fighting – insisting she was ready to walk away from the US talks, if her “red lines” were crossed.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Reports suggest it moved very quickly in January to close its border to halt the spread. A tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University says the country has a total of 215 infections and no deaths.The Associated Press said those diagnosed have generally been Mongolians returning from Russia and other nearby nations. The ministry of health said 158 had recovered and 57 remained in treatment and isolation.It said on Wednesday that the country was holding parliamentary elections. It said the Mongolian People’s Party was seeking to retain the 65 seats it won in the 76-seat State Great Khural in 2016 while its chief rival, the Democratic Party, looks to win back some losses.Despite economic problems and a high level of unemployment, it said the government had received praise for its handling of the virus. People on Wednesday were obliged to maintain a several feet between each other as they voted.The Mongolian embassy said the plane later departed Seattle for Ulan Bator, carrying with it more than 200 Mongolian citizens stranded in the US, and several crates of dinosaur fossils that belonged to Mongolia.Additional reporting by the Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job.

How could it not The sense of countryside and fresh air it evokes, the tweed caps, the fingerless mittens, the ornate walking stick . . .  just the innate Britishness of it all. Such a far cry from the smog, red carpets, bling and supercars of LA.And then, of course, it’s a reminder of the people he’s known since birth.Those who, unlike the “mwah mwah”, showbiz crowd, love him for who, rather than what, he is.Whichever way you view his behaviour of late, it’s undeniable that there is a huge, Harry-shaped hole in this image of family togetherness.Of course, there are Zoom meetings to be had and, post-lockdown, the occasional visit to be made. But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm. While the new name — Lost The Pot Noodle — is inspired, one notes that it now requires the consumer to put the ingredients in a mug or make it in a pan on the stove.As any self-respecting, Olympically idle student will tell you, a clean mug is a rarer sighting than an eclipse and, as for a pan, eventhey own one it will be housing enough penicillin growth to solve America’s recent shortage.So, memo to Unilever: Don’t phase out the original just yet.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They, and our many other attractions, are the reason people fly thousands of miles to enjoy the West End.“So we are doing what we can to support our hospitality business through the vital summer months and into the autumn. The residents’ groups we have spoken to have been very supportive as they know this is a temporary measure for the benefit of all of Westminster.“The West End in particular is a unique global draw, and I am confident we can give it and our other famous locations a continental sheen that visitors, residents and regulars alike will enjoy.”Kate Nicholls, of UK Hospitality, said: “We are going to need a dynamic and supportive approach to reopening hospitality businesses and Westminster council is showing positivity in its plans to get businesses back up and running.”The news in Westminster comes as the Government is set to bring in new planning and licensing laws to help businesses to cope.Legislation to be pushed through Parliament starting this week will allow pubs temporary permission to transform car parks and other outdoor spaces into dining areas without permission, too.Today new guidance for pubs and restaurants was revealed, meaning people will have a very dferent experience when they go out from July .Live music will be banned, along with showing anything on screens which encourages people to shout.So it looks like football matches will be off for now - alongside other sports games.Dancing will also be not allowed, and people will have to leave their contact details with the venue for  days in case of an outbreak.The new measures come into effect on England on July , but Scotland and Wales have not said they will follow suit yet.JULY th is Independence Day in America – and it’s shaping up that way too in Westminster.Across the City, my council is responsible for , licensed bars, restaurants and cafes. They are part of the tourist offer that draws visitors from across the world, and why people enjoy a night in the West End.My council has taken the pioneering step of announcing that we will allow dozens of streets to become temporary outdoor restaurants with tables and chairs. It means more choice in those busy areas like Soho, Covent Garden and Chinatown.Equally importantly, it will help to keep people in jobs. The hospitality industry is a major employer, and we all know how tough it has been for workers while the shutters have been down.Now, we could all make jokes about the famous British weather and weather al fresco dining will work here in the way it does in Dubai or Malaga. But it is something I am determined to try to give our embattled bar owners and restauranteurs a chance to get going again.I hope Sun readers will once again enjoy a night out in the West End of London - and celebrate Independence Day for our hospitality trade.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

AntihistaminesAntihistamine tablets, capsules and sprays can relieve most hay fever symptoms – sneezing, itchy, runny eyes, skin irritation, itchy nose and throat – but are less effective for nasal congestion.Although strong antihistamines can be prescribed by a GP, most people buy antihistamines over the counter in a pharmacy.These usually contain either Cetirizine or Loratadine. If one doesn’t work for you, you can try the other one.Some contain chlorphenamine and these are more liable to make you drowsy. All antihistamines can make you drowsy and it is illegal to drivethey do. It is also dangerous to operate machinery.. Steroid nasal spraysSteroid nasal sprays help reduce inflammation in the nose.They work best for clearing nasal symptoms – itching, sneezing, watering and congestion – although sprays sometimes clear eye symptoms too.Again, look for the active ingredients - beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone or mometasone – own brand versions can be cheaper.. Allergen barrier balmsOrganic drug-free allergen barrier balms such as HayMax are applied to the nostrils and bones of the eyes in the morning and throughout the day.They are used to stop allergens from entering the body through the nose.They are especially useful as they can be used immediately, together with other hay fever products and are suitable for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women.”. Immune supportTaking products that can help boost your immune system can be useful.Bee Prepared Daily Defence Immune Support is an immune boosting wellness formula for adults and children that contains all natural ingredients which have a history of benefits and clinically researched actions which help support the immune system.Please note that this product isn’t suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding mums.. Acupressure bandsAcupressure is a non-invasive form of acupuncture, achieved by applying physical pressure of hands, elbows, feet or devices to the same acupuncture points.It is used in a wide iety of conditions including hay fever. The Qu-Chi Hay Fever Band uses acupressure to target key pressure points on the body associated with allergy symptoms.The band is worn on one of these pressure points, the elbow. Adult and child sizes are available. This product is not suitable for pregnant women.Hay fever sufferers need to make sure they have plenty of aids this week as experts have claimed that the freak heatwave in the UK will make it the worst week in the year for sufferers.In some places temperatures are set to reach C and this spells further misery for hay fever sufferers.Airborne allergens expert and creator of HayMax allergen barrier balms, Max Wiseberg, said: “Once again we’ve just had lots of rain during the peak pollen season, which has fed the grass beautully.“And this can only mean one thing – yet another massive explosion of pollen.“This is turning out to be one of the worst weeks for hay fever sufferers that we’ve had in a long time, in fact we could be having one of the worst years ever too!”Max also recommends the Qu-Chi band as a hay fever remedy.He added: “Acupressure is a non-invasive form of acupuncture, achieved by applying physical pressure of hands, elbows, feet or devices to the same acupuncture points.“It is used in a wide iety of conditions including hay fever.

The PM said yesterday he was looking forward to the bustle toto Britains streets as he announced most businesses would be able to reopen. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: We will also re-open restaurants and pubs.    But he warned: All hospitality indoors will be limited to table-service, and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact.The PM has refused to rule out bringing back a national lockdowncoronavirus cases start to rise again - so restaurants and pubs will have to follow strict rules to make sure people stick to social distancing. The days of crowding around bars waiting to order are over in a new normal of pub visits. Venues and being encouraged to be table-service only, and have guests order drinks and food through an app where possible.The guidance said: Indoor table service must be used where possible. Outdoor table service should also be encouraged though customers are permitted to stand outsidedistanced appropriately. The guidelines do not rule out ordering from the bar entirely, but warns venues should prevent customers from remaining at the bar or counter after ordering. Pubs have been told to encourage the use of contactless ordering from tables where available - for example, through an ordering app. The new rules mean people wont be able to hang out at the bar after theyve ordered, and will have to find a table or stand outside. All meetings indoors must only be with no more than two households at a time. Staff could also radio orders through to the kitchens to reduce movement by discouraging non-essential trips within venues. While both pubs and sports matches will have ed, Brits wont be able to do both at the same time. To discourage large groups of people coming together and yelling at TV screens or each other, broadcasts have been banned. Loud music will also be banned to stop people having to shout to be heard by their friends.The guidance says venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission.Live music and performances wont be allowed to continue under the new plans. The guidance warns venues they should not permit live performances, including drama, comedy and music, to take place in front of a live audience. Singing is a particular concerns - as droplets potentially carrying coronavirus could travel further as pub goers belt out their favourite songs.Dancing is also out, pubs have been told totake steps to prevent other close contact activities such as communal dancing. Venues are being encouraged to use disposable condiment packets where possible to limit the spread of germs via surfaces.Otherwise bottles need to be cleaned thoroughly after each use. Cutlery wont be laid out on tables unless people order food either. The guidance says venues should minimise customer self service of food, cutlery and condiments to reduce the risk of transmission. For example, providing cutlery and condiments only when food is served.The guidance says businesses should help the NHS Test and Trace system by keeping a registry of patrons contact details for at least  days in case of an outbreak. Venues are told to assistby keeping a temporary record of your customers and visitors for  days, in a way that is manageable for your business, and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that dataneeded. This could help contain clusters or outbreaks. Many businesses that take bookings already have systems for recording their customers and visitors – including restaurants, hotels, and hair salons. If you do not already do this, you should do so to help fight the virus.If there is an outbreak, it will allow contact tracers to easily find out who was in a pub or restaurant at a particular time. Pubs and restaurants will have to reduce the number of people in venues at any one time to allow for social distancing - but also to discourage public transport use. The new rules will ban groups of more than  people to form. That means evenvenues can have  people  metres apart they wont be able to.The guidance says: Evenit is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue. Venues in nearby areas will have to work together to stagger arrival and departure times to avoid massive queues forming close to each other. Toilets which have been closed throughout the coronavirus crisis will reopen in pubs, restaurants and public places.But they will have to be subject to strict hygiene restrictions and extra cleaning. Venues are encouraged to use hand sanistiser where entering.And pubs are urged to use a limited entry approach to toilets inside venues with a one in one out rule.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pursuit mode, it has a range of  nautical miles. The Pacic  has been used in sea boat operations from Royal Navy warships for more than  years.But the new drone version of the boat could provide a more streamlined way of carrying out its wide range of operations - and even open up some new types of missions.The boats will be controlled from a parent ship, such as a frigate or destroyer.Defence Minister Jeremy Quin said: Commencing the trials of the crewless Pacic  boat is an important stepping stone in the Royal Navys development of its autonomous capability to ensure our fleet remains at the forefront of military innovation and technology, ready to meet the evolving threats of modern warfare.The crewless Pacic  is sponsored by NavyX, the specialist wing of the Royal Navy which trials cutting-edge technology for use on the front line.The team has worked in partnership with BAE Systems, which builds the Pacic  in Portsmouth, to commission the new boat.A prototype, controlled from the frigate HMS Argyll, debuted at the DSEI defence technology showcase in London last September, since when BAE and the Navy have pressed ahead with a working model fit for the front line.The vessels control system and sensors mean a sailor should be able to give the unmanned craft generic tasking, and the boat will decide for itself how it carries out that task.Lieutenant Commander Rob Manson of the NavyX team said: The autonomous nature of this craft adds huge capability and flexibility.Brooke Hoskins, Products and Training Services Director at BAE Systems said: We are proud to support the Royal Navys autonomous requirements, which includes increasing its operational effectiveness whilst reducing the burden on, or threat to, its sailors.Trials with the new craft begin this month, followed by trials with a Royal Navy warship later this year which should determine whether the UK invests in a fleet of such craft or just a few for specic missions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more. Rough And Rowdy Ways is a joy to listen to – and I’d given up on the bloke in the s.If I ever reach  I intend to make a grime album with Rihanna. Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative. But there aren’t enough people called Olly and Poppy in the country, which is why Labour hasn’t won an election for  years. Unless it reconnects with the people it was set up to support, the working class, it won’t win one for another few decades either.A SOCIAL media site had a big hit when it asked people to reveal things they regretted about getting married. The site, Whisper, was inundated with replies. Most were kind of: “I just wish I hadn’t married the fat bastard, full stop.”But some wished they’d had a fling with someone of the same sex first, or felt aggrieved they hadn’t checked out the in-laws first. That was quite a big issue.

And eager children have ed straight back into lessons under strict social distancing rules without hassle.Thecomes in spite of teaching unions pouring scorn over moves to get all kids safely back in class by September.Headteacher Ben Hulme said tonight: “Schools like us have shown it can be done safely for both children and staff.“This is a time when unions, schools and headteachers should all be pulling together to get children back in class. To be isive makes it really dficult to get back to some safe normality.“There have been many reports about how lockdown has affected children’s mental health and emotional wellbeing — and how there’s potential for damage to be donewe don’t move quickly. That really spurred us on to get something together — and it’s working very well.“We’re really pleased to be back and I’d encourage other schools to do the samethey can.”Under the new plans, the Government aims to form “year group bubbles” in secondary schools.This would stop pupils mingling with teenagers from other year groups, while allowing classes toto their normal size.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson hailed St Paul’s safe and swt— and called on others to take “full advantage” of the chance to open again.He told The Sun: “We have given primary schools the flexibility to bring back more children — where they can do so within our protective measures — and it’s fantastic to see some schools taking full advantage of that to maximise their capacity and invite back all pupils.”Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, heaped praise on St Paul’s — and urged other schools to follow its lead.She said: “This is a real achievement and great to see teachers working with parents to get the whole school open safely before the summer break.”The Government originally ­pledged to get all primary schools back in action for at least a month before June . But ministers had to ditch the plans over fears that the target would not be met.Militant unions have been accused of playing politics and stopping kids ing to class, instead of putting their welfare first.Department for Education data revealed , pupils were in class last month — down from . million on a normal school day.Latest figures show approximately . million attended school last Thursday — . per cent of pupils who normally attend.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Boris Johnson told MPs yesterday that education would restart fully at the start of autumn term.It was welcome news for millions of parents who have endured three months of lockdown — many juggling full-time jobs with childcare and home-schooling. Secondary schools in England have been allowed to reopen for Years ,  and  since June .Nursery and pre-school children, plus pupils in Reception, Year  and Year , started toon June .But not all schools have reopened fully. Some do not have the staff and others do not have the space.Current government guidance for schools does not require kids to socially distance within their bubble, but many schools are ignoring the advice, insisting on all pupils remaining two-metres apart.The rules planned for September would make clear that social distancing would not be required within bubbles.Instead, kids will be encouraged to limit contact with each other.Its Headmaster Ben Hulme used his imagination, created extra space on the school field and put other hygiene measures in place.Now, to the delight of parents, almost all his pupils started back on Monday. And that’s with the two-metre rule.Yes, it’s easier with a small school. But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left. Although the Government could have done better in prioritising education, the wrecking crew have revelled in confronting and defying the Tories, blocking efforts to reopen fully.Even now, the PM’s announcement that schools must open in September is branded “pure fantasy” by one union.We do not yet know the true cost to our children’s education, le chances and health from this failure of will.The unions have betrayed our kids and tarnished the image of the teachers they represent and who would love to get back to the classroom.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Social distancing mandates were also observed.The Arbery family did not know when the next steps would be taken after a probable cause hearing was held earlier this month.“The family was ecstatic to hear that it had happened this morning, said Holmes.When a person is indicted, he is given formal notice that it is believed that he committed a crime, according to the Department of Justice.The indictment contains the basic information that informs the person of the charges against him.The grand jury has found that there is enough evidence to pursue a criminal case against Travis and Greg McMichael.William Roddie Bryan, who recorded the deadly encounter, was also indicted on felony murder and malice charges.It was after Bryans cellphone footage leaked online that the McMichaels were arrested.Bryan was busted last month after he tried “to confine and detain” Arbery without legal authority by “utilizing his vehicle on multiple occasions” before Arbery was shot, according to authorities.Prosecutors believe that Bryan played a major role in Arberys death by hitting him with the side of his vehicle.All three defendants are also charged with two counts of aggravated assault and one count each of  imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit  imprisonment.Bryans lawyer said his client has committed no crime and has cooperated with law enforcement officers from the beginning.“We welcome the action of the grand jury today, said Kevin Gough.While we disagree with it, it’s an important step in the process to moving this case closer to the speedy trial that Roddie has demanded.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Between October and April  they committed a series of armed robberies andburglaries at commercial and residential premises.He said they used serious violence which escalated over time.They went to signicant s to disguise themselves and chosevulnerable targets such as small stores which had a limited amount ofstaff, Mr Duck said.They arrived in stolen cars which were used to get away at the fastest speed possible.Mr Duck said: They arrived mob-handed, conspicuously armed withknives, making a lot of noise and terrying those they encountered.They raided safes and cashpoints.The first shop targeted was a One Stop in Bristol Road North,Northfield, on October . They made off with £, after wielding ahammer, kne and crow bar and workers to the back of the premises.The gang also netted arond £, after terrorising two employees atthe Barnt Green Inn pubb and snatched £,-worth of mobiles from aphone shop where staff were threatened.Saddler was arrested following a struggle with police after a raid ona Car Phone Warehouse.But that did not deter the close knit team, who attacked a TescoExpress in Northfield armed themselves with weapons including a gun.Describing the attack on the home of the -year-old footballer, Mr Duck said there was evidence that the premises had been deliberately targeted.He went on: The male occupant of the premises was not there that day.He was at work.Members of the gang, armed with knives, parked alongside a hedgebefore breaking in.They stayed briefly downstairs before going upstairs where -year-oldMiss Hickman was trying to catch up on some sleep.She was woken from her sleep and greeted by the sight of a man whowas obviously masked and carrying a large black kne, Mr Duck said.The intruder, Nicholas Rothero, was then joined by Jones and CoryRothero and one of them picked up a gold kne from the side of the bedwhich her partner used to open parcels and envelopes.She was completely trapped and confined with the confines of her bedroom.Mr Duck said they knew something about her boyfriend and expressedsurprise he was not there.During the trial, Miss Hickman said the raiders demanded jewellery and money.She said she had been petried and they had accused her partner ofbeing a gangbanger and demanded to know when he was coming back.They snatched her Rolex and told her the footballer could fork out foranother one.When she told them her mother was on the way, the men told her hershed get hurt when she arrived.The raiders also took keys to Gray’s Mercedes only to discover it wasnot on the driveway before they fled with £,-worth of cash andjewellery in a stolen car.Passing sentence, Judge Richard Bond said the offences were executedruthlessly and with a real degree of success.He said that on two occasions guns were used to instil fear intovictims so they would co-operate.A feature is the professionalism in the way the offending was carriedout, he told the gangsters.Full disguises were used by the offenders to cause victims to beintimidated when confronted by you.Victims were made to feel scared and helpless and on some occasionsfearful for their lives.Your professionalism was also demonstrated by the speed of the offences.You targeted vulnerable premises.

Government guidance today shows many toilets will need to be one-in, one-out and bar staff hidden behind screens to prevent the spread of the virus. Pubs will be told to keep lists of everyone who comes in for  days in case there is an outbreak - with more outdoor seats and tape to mark distance on the floor. Bar managers will be told to work with their rivals on the same street to make sure they stagger their opening times. And punters will be warned they canapost shelter insidea rainstorm - otherwise they could cause an outbreak. We knew a lot of the restrictions already. For example, you can only sit indoors with one other household - socially distanced. If youaposre in the beer garden, you can sit in a group of up to six - socially distanced - or in a group of two households of any size. Now the governmentaposs guidance shows just how dferent the new normal will be to le before. Here are  key ways itaposll change your experience of the pub. . Loud music or broadcasts will be banned to stop people shouting  Loud music or loud broadcasts like football will be banned to stop people shouting at each other. The guidance says all venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission. It also says loud background music, communal dancing, group singing or chanting should be prevented. . Live music, comedy and dance floors will be banned  The guidance says venues should not permit live performances, including drama, comedy and music, to take place in front of a live audience. This is to stop aerosol transmission - from either the performer or their audience. Theatres are likewise allowed to open but onlythey donapost put on a live show. Dance floors in pubs and bars are also banned. You should take steps to prevent close contact activities, such as communal dancing, the guidance says. . Ketchup bottles and cutlery are banished from tables  The guidance says pubs and restaurants should provide cutlery and condiments only when food is served. And the days of the communal ketchup or mayonnaise bottle are numbered - as pubs and restaurants should provide only disposable condiments. Communal bottles are allowed but onlythey are cleaned after every single use. . Everyone has to give their name to staff - and itaposs kept for  days  All pubs, bars, restaurants and more are being told to assist with the NHS Test and Trace programme. That means keeping a temporary record of your customers and visitors for  days. The guidance doesnapost say how this should be done but lists visitor books or bookings records. Pubs will need to assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that dataneeded in order to contain clusters or outbreaks. . Bar staff will stand behind screens  The guidance recommends using screens or barriers to separate workers from each other, and from customers at points of service. That could mean bar staff serving from behind a perspex screen to avoid transmission. Staff are also asked to use back-to-back or side-to-side working possible. And staff rotas will need to be redrawn so each person only has contact with a fixed number of others on their team. Tables will be spaced further apart and floor tape or paint will be used to mark areas to help people comply with social distancing. They should be two metres apart - or one metrethere is risk mitigation in place like screens, back-to-back seating or face coverings. . Some toilets will be one-in, one-out  The guidance recommends one way flow systems to stop people bunching up - such as using one door as an entry and one as an exit. Pubs should also arrange one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues, it says. But thataposs a problem when it comes to pub toilets, many of which are cramped with narrow entrances. On toilets, the guidance urges pubs to use a limited entry approach, with one in, one out. . Youaposll get more outdoor seats, table service - and use apps to order your drinks  Pubs are being encouraged to put in more outdoor seats - with changes coming down the track to let them use car parks as beer gardens. Outdoor table service should also be encouraged, the guidance says - and table service should be followed as a rule to stop people queues. Where bar or counter service is unavoidable, people should be stopped from staying at the bar or counter after ordering, or leaning on it. Pubs are also told to encourage use of contactless ordering from tables where available - for example, through an ordering app. . Staff could radio food orders through to the kitchen Staff are told to reduce movement by discouraging non-essential trips within venues. That could mean restricting access to some areas, encouraging use of radios, telephones or other electronic devices when sending orders from service areas to kitchens, where permitted. The radios would have to be cleaned between use. . Youaposll be banned from propping up the bar - or sheltering from the rain  Pubs are warned they have to plan for keeping the -metre or aposone metre plusapos rules eventhere is a thunderstorm. They need to be clear that customers cannot seek shelter indoors unless social distancing can be maintained. . Indoor spaces will have to be massively below capacity  Sitting indoors will be allowed - but numbers are strictly limited. New coronavirus laws from July  in England will make it illegal for groups of more than  people to form. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other venues will be exempt from the aposgroup of apos law, which exists mainly to prevent things like raves. But even so, the guidance warns pubs may have to lower capacity even further than it would bethey had all tables two metres apart. The guidance explains: Evenit is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue. . Youaposll see this sign in the window  Pubs should work with their customers to tell them about the restrictions on gatherings. That means not gathering indoors with more than one other household. And it means not gathering outdoors with more than either one other household, or six people in total from any number of households. In , firms should also display a notication in a prominent place to show a risk assessment has been carried out and theyaposre following the rules. A picture of the notice is above. . Nearby pubs must work together to open at dferent times Inidual businesses should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations. This might have to include staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas.

But the Government faces fresh calls from unions to make sure that hospitality workers are protected against the deadly disease - and the economic fallout from the crisis. Boris Johnson has set out plans to reopen pubs, restaurants and other venues from July  after three months of lockdown have pushed many to the brink of collapse.Hospitality sector chiefs have warned that thousands of jobs have already been lost and hundreds of businesses have gone bust. Under the plans, councils across the country will be able to pedestrianise areas and relax rules so outdoor markets, pop-up car-boot sales and summer fairs will not need a planning application. There will also be changes to licensing laws to allow many more pubs, bars and restaurants sell alcohol to drink where, making social distancing easier. Other changes include allowing hospitality venues to use car parks and terraces as dining and drinking areas so customers can enjoy their drinks and food outside. The measures, which will be rushed through the Commons, come into force before they reopen next week.

Robert Jenrick tonight agreed to release correspondence relating to the Westferry Printworks development, planned by millionaire mogul Richard Desmond in East London. The redevelopment, said to be worth £ billion, was approved in January by Mr Jenrick against the recommendation of a planning inspector. The local council in Tower Hamlets were set to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levythe day after Mr Jenrick stepped in and approved the plan. The levy would have obliged Mr Desmond to contribute at least £ million to support projects in the area. The decision was reversed after legal action by Tower Hamlets Council and Mr Jenrick accepted his decision was unlawful by reason of apparent bias. In heavily redacted emails released by Mr Jenrickaposs office tonight, officials discussed the Secretary of Stateaposs sense of urgency in granting the approval. In one email discussion, an unnamed Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government official wrote: On timing, my understanding is that [Mr Jenrick] is was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL regime. Another email reads: The appellant [Mr Desmond] believes that the proposal would not be viableliable to CIL charges. Text messages between Mr Jenrick and Mr Desmond reveal conversations between the pair after they had sat at the same table at a Tory fundraiser. Arranging a site visit to view the development, Mr Desmond wrote: We appreciate the speed as we donapost want to give Marxists loads of doe for nothing. In reply, Mr Jenrick warned Mr Desmond it was important not to give any appearance of being influenced by applicants of cases that I may have a role in or to have predetermined them and so I think it is best that we donapost meet until after the matter has decided. In a later text message to which Mr Jenrick did not reply, Mr Desmond explicitly told the minister the urgency in having the development approved was to save money in taxes. Mr Desmond wrote: We have to get the approval before January  otherwise payment of  million pounds to Tower Hamlets, meaning we have to stop and reduce social housing. Thanks Robert, look forward to speaking soon, Best, Richard. According to the documents, the March site visit did not take place and no further communication followed because Mr Jenrick did not take Mr Desmondaposs  calls when he attempted to get in contact on a number of occasions. Thereaposs no record in any of the documents of Mr Jenrickaposs department taking an interest in the deal prior to the Minister and Mr Jenrick sitting at the same table at a Tory dinner in November . Mr Jenrick was the first to make written contact with Mr Desmond, sending a text after the event which read: Good to spend time with you tonight, Richard. See you again soon I hope. Mr Jenrick insisted the row over his involvement in the Westferry Printworks planning decision was politically motivated. But he agreed to release documents and correspondence relating to the decision in accordance with Freedom of Information rules. He said he would release all relevant information relating to the planning decision later today.It came after Labour warned the row had blown apart confidence in the planning system.Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed told the Commons: The only way to put that right is for the Secretary of State to publish the evidence about what really happened. If heaposs done nothing wrong then heaposs got nothing to fear. So I hope he will welcome this opportunity to restore trust in a sector that will be so critical in rebuilding Britain after the lockdown. Mr Jenrick told MPs: I will write to the chair of the select committee outlining the timeline of events and the rationale for my decision-making pertaining to the Westferry Printworks planning decision. Alongside this letter, and after a comprehensive review of what documents might be in scope of this motion, and of the letter that he sent me on behalf of his select committee, I will be releasing later today all relevant information relating to this planning matter using the Freedom of Information Act as a benchmark.

She cries “solidarity” with the Black Lives Matter protesters who have taken to the streets across the world, after attending “every single anti-apartheid march” she could in her younger days. Now , much of her energy is spent fighting for the rights of the older generation with the Lambeth Pensioners Action Group and as a vice president of the National Pensioners Convention. Social care problems, low pensions and loneliness can affect all older people but, she says, inequality means black pensioners face even more disadvantage. Ellen says: “The British pension is one of the lowest in the developed world. As far as black pensioners are concerned, not only are they affected by a very poor pension, many of us occupied jobs which were classied as low-skilled – we didn’t earn an amount of money where we could put away for a rainy day or have savings, so we’re less well off than others.” Housing is a particular problem, “Most of us live on very poor estates and because we didn’t have much money, we’re not able to shop at Waitrose, we go down to Brixton Market or we go down the road to Lidl,” she says “Many of us live in cold, damp and poorly insulated housing and we are suffering illness as a result of that.” In addition, diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis and high cholesterol are among the ailments that affect black communities disproportionately, making le as a black pensioner especially hard. But Ellen is also a passionate campaigner on issues that affect all pensioners, especially the broken promise that the TV license would be funded for the over-s, which the Mirror is campaigning over strongly. “For older people, especially the poor ones, it’s a lot of money,” Ellen says. “There are many of us who can’t leave our homes. In winter especially, we don’t leave our homes. Now with Covid-, we are scared to leave our homes. Some of us who live on our own are really lonely and the TV is the only company. It talks to us and some of us talk to the TV! “Sometimes when I watch Newsnight or a documentary, I speak to them, I challenge them. I know they can’t hear me.”  Ellen is proud of her South African heritage and belonging to the Sotho tribe. African artwork adorns the walls of her South London home, and her CD rack is stacked high with music from some of the most prolic black artists such as Nina Simone, as well as jazz compilations and several reggae albums. My own music collection embraces my black heritage too. I grew up on soulful RB, reggae and classic hip-hop. Now, I find myself drawn to dancehall, grime and rap – perhaps looking for the same voices, sense of belonging and retellings of my realities that older generations found in Nina Simone and Bob Marley. But as someone who is more than  years her junior, and born and raised in London, the idea of anything other than multiculturalism is dficult to imagine. So Ellen tells of growing up in Cape Town: “There’s a beautul mountain, Table Mountain. I was born at the little bit overlooking the ocean.”  Now, South Africa is associated with fine wines, cricket, and safari tourism, but for Ellen and many other South Africans, the scars of growing up under apartheid are not forgotten. During her youth, it was always evident where society placed her and people who looked like her, even in simple things like a trip to the beach. “It was segregated – ours was just the rocks and the sand. The white side had the restaurants, changing rooms. They had spaces where the children could play, with swings. The recreational facilities were not ours so we knew we were dferent.” Under apartheid, schools for non-whites were underfunded. You lived with the people who looked like you, and you all shared similar experiences – usually of deprivation and poverty. A quota system at universities meant they “only allowed a certain number of black students into each faculty”. But Ellen took a degree in English with her fees funded by her mother’s employer.  “My mother couldn’t afford to send me to university,” Ellen says. “My father died when I was . My mother cleaned the homes of rich white people and they paid my university fees.” She became a teacher and in  she moved to the UK – which she has called home ever since. Explaining how black identity is dferent in the two countries, she says: “Blackness in South Africa is part of the colonial history. The blackness here, it is us coming in, rather than us being born here.” This “otherness” underlies many of Britain’s race relations issues, she says. Ellen recalls an incident during her time as a teacher that proved to her that racism is taught – and, perhaps, can also be unlearned. She says: “You’re not born a racist. Your experience of racism is what is imposed on you. Those kids just saw me as Ms Lebethe. A good example is when we went to France. We got to Dover and I had to get off the bus to have my passport checked. They had a group passport and they were all British, I was still on my South African passport so I had a visa.  “One of the kids said to me, ‘Miss, why do you have to get off of the bus ’ and I said, ‘I have to have my passport checked because I’m a South African, I’m not British’. The kid said to me, ‘But you’re our miss. How can you be dferent ’” Ellen taught at several schools across the capital including in Tottenham, North London, where she observed the Broadwater Farm Riots, sparked by injustices at the hands of the police. Of the current protests, she says: “This isn’t new – George Floyd has just blown it wide open. It’s been brought to the fore quite vividly not only by his death but the response to his death.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brits flock beaches uk set","story":"NewsBrits flock to beaches as UK set to be hotter than Greek islandsThe mercury hit .C at Heathrow yesterday, the hottest day of the year so far.

The site on Lynn Road makes canned foods and pouched grub for general sale. LincolnshireLive reports the site was closed for  hours for a deep clean but has since reopened. A Princes spokesperson said:Our first priority is the well-being and safety of our colleagues. We have been following government advice since the outbreak of Covid- and will continue to do so.“We can confirm fourteen of our Wisbech-based colleagues have recently tested positive for coronavirus. The total number of colleagues at Wisbech is . “As soon as these colleagues were symptomatic, they were asked to self-isolate and contact the health authorities to be tested, and to be logged as part of track and trace efforts. A deep clean of the facilities these colleagues used was also conducted, alongside further stringent cleaning across the site. As an additional step, we took the responsible decision to temporarily close the whole site for  hours so a further deep clean could be completed. The site has now reopened. The spokesperson added: “Throughout the period that Covid- has presented a risk, we have implemented social distancing measures and adapted our work environment in line with relevant guidance to minimise the chances of infection within the factory. All colleagues that are able to work from home are doing so and we have taken steps to ensure we have adequate supply of PPE for our colleagues. “We remain in close contact with Public Health England and Fenland Council so they are fully informed of our approach and developments at the site.” This marks the fourth factory to be hit by the worrying coronavirus outbreak in meat processing plants.  Close working conditions and cold temperatures are said to be at the root of the problem. The Kepak plant in Merthyr Tydfil has reportedly had eight cases of Covid- this month already. Scientists believe the cold air inside the food processing factories could make those inside more susceptible.

Jess Jackson, described as a beautul lady and a massive character, lost her two-year battle with the disease on June  leaving behind her three young children Max, seven Leo, six and Jenson, three. Her heartbroken mother Lynda Gilling has made an emotional appeal to other young women to make sure they attend their cervical screening appointments. Lynda said: My daughter knew what she wanted in le. She loved doing things with her three children outdoors, like taking them to the park. They were her world. Jess, who lived in Rumney, Cardf, first noticed typical signs of cervical cancer - which can include unusual bleeding and pelvic pain - at the age of just . After tests were carried out in hospital, it was confirmed that the disease was present. I was shocked more than anything . She was so young to have cancer. It was heartbreaking, added Lynda. Jess, fondly known to family members as aposJapos, then underwent several rounds of chemotherapy which her mum said made her sick and led to her losing her hair.  Despite making small signs of progress, in January this year the cancer was found to have spread to her stomach and lymph nodes and was deemed terminal. A GoFundMe page has now been set up by one of her close friends, Stacey-Marie Osborne, to pay for Jessapos funeral which is set to take place next month. Any money left over will be put into a bank account for her three boys, said Lynda. Friend Stacey-Marie Osborne added: Jess was a massive character and fought a very hard battle.  She was the type of friend you needed in your le to give you a straight, honest answer - and she did just that. She was very protective over her friends, but most importantly her three gorgeous boys who have now lost their mum to such a horrible disease. Jess was big, bold and beautul.

So his parents Claire, , and Mike, , are trying to raise a whopping £, to get him on a plane to New York by September where he can receive an experimental vaccine.

Mum Claire said: “We are running out of time, to have come this far is unbelievable but we just need one last push.” Neuroblastoma is a cancer which forms in certain types of nerve tissue and the vast majority of cases occur in children under five-years-old but it is known to relapse.

The vaccine is licensed in the USA but not yet in Europe. The family learned the awful news about Liam last July just a day after Claire gave birth to his baby sister Kylie. But they have been tirelessly fundraising ever since.  Claire said: “Hearing he had cancer the day after you gave birth to his sister was incredibly tough, I had her in my arms when I was told and then Liam had to start treatment the very same day, so it has been incredibly tough for us ever since. “I can only describe finding out your son has cancer as pure pain and being broken beyond belief.” They were given an early boost in their fundraising efforts thanks to former Dagenham and Redbridge footballer Charlie Holmes whose daily runs for Liam on social media went viral.

At his biggest he weighed a whopping st ½lbs but has now managed to slim down to an impressive st lbs in just three years. Phil said his turning point was when his mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer and realised he need to be healthy. He said he had previously resigned himself to dying alone but while he was on his weight loss journey he met his partner Nicole Mulholland. The civil servant, from County Down, Northern Ireland, also believes his weight loss may have saved his le after he caught coronavirus. He added that his survival was a timely reminder how important his health is. Phil was helped in his dramatic transformation by Slimming World, who recently crowned him their aposGreatest Loser apos. Despite its name, the competition celebrates the person with the highest weight loss among all the brandaposs members. Phil said: I was always bigger than my peers. I remember at school being called out by my PE teacher for being too big to play football. The weight really started to pile on though when I started university.  My size meant that my le became increasingly insular and I made up a iety of excuses not to go out. I’d avoid gatherings like parties and weddings because I just felt so uncomfortable. I knew I wouldn’t fit into a plane seat so I never travelled, even though I really wanted to. Apart from my job as a civil servant, I didn’t really do anything except hide away and eat. It was a very lonely time. At his heaviest Phil suffered a string of other health issues including pressure on his knees and sleep apnoea. His shirt size was a huge XXXXXXXXL, with a in waist. But his main worry was that should he die in his sleep and that heavy body couldn’t be removed as he lived on the third floor of his parents’ house. Phil then realised he had to do something about his weight when his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  He said: Mum was facing her fourth cancer battle which sadly turned out to be her last. The news sort of spurred me into action and I knew this time I had to try and be as healthy as I could - not just for her but for me as well. I was also worried thatmy mum did pass away, I wouldn’t be able to be one of her pallbearers, which was heartbreaking. She died in October , by which point I’d lost st. I know she’d be really proudshe could see me now - more than st lighter.Phil has become much more active since losing all the weight - and has started cyclingagain after a near three-decade absence from the activity. He said: Years of being overweight really took its toll on my knees and I used to take medication daily to manage the pain. I will still need a knee replacement at some stage, but I have certainly delayed the inevitable and made the operation itself more likely to be successful.  When I was st, my doctor told me it was too risky for me to have surgery because calculating the anaesthetic needed for someone my size was so tricky. Now I’ve started cycling again, I can walk without getting out of breath and I also enjoy yoga. It’s a completely dferent le to the one I had before - one that is full of opportunities, friends and adventures. Phil also credits his weight loss with helping him to meet partner Nicole, whohe found on an online dating app. He said: By far the best thing that has happened to me since losing weight is meeting Nicole. When I was bigger I couldn’t imagine ever finding love and felt resigned to dying alone. Since meeting we’ve moved in together, swam in the Mediterranean Sea, been on a walking tour of Berlin and I’ve learned to drive.  There are lots more adventures we want to tick off the list and for the first time in a long time, I’m excited about the future. Phil also thinks his thinner size could have helped him beat what he thought was coronavirus. He said that, while it was unpleasant and he was knocked off his feet, he’s not sure he would have survivedhe hadn’t lost weight. He added: I dread to think how my body would have responded. It was a timely reminder of how important my health is. Phil was encouraged to join Slimming World in July  by a friend who agreed to attend his local group with him.He said: I was, of course, nervous on that first night but it really helped to havemy friend Laura beside me.I even contacted the consultant in advance to check the scales would be able to weigh me.  The last time I’d weighed myself was at the hospital, where I had to stand on two sets of scales just to get a reading. My consultant assured me that there was nothing to worry about and she was right. Everyone was so supportive and friendly and although it was a shock to see the scales hit st, for the first time, I felt like I could do something about it. Phil soon got to grips with a branded eating plan, which enabled him to lose weight while enjoying a wide iety of foods. It includes lean meat, potatoes, pasta, fruit and vegetables. He said: In the past I’d been referred to dieticians and dabbled with intermittent fasting and restricting my portions. I would lose weight initially but I could never stick to it because I was hungry most of the time.  What was so dferent about Slimming World was that I could still eat hearty meals to satisfy my appetite while losing weight. It felt like a bit of a lightbulb moment when I realised losing weight didn’t have to mean starving yourself. I was a bit vegetable-phobic when I first joined but now one of my favourite dishes is a Mediterranean vegetable pasta - and I even tend to an allotment with a veggie patch! The group environment really helped me too because for the first time I was surrounded by people who knew how it felt to struggle with their weight. Checking in with everyone each week has been invaluable and I have learned so much from everyone. I attend virtually now that we’re in lockdown, which is really great and helps keep me on track. I couldn’t be without them. Phil attends the Bangor Slimming World group.  Philaposs diet before Breakfast - sausage roll or a sausage bap with cheese and ketchup. Full fat latte or cappuccino with added sugar. Lunch - tinned soup with - rounds of white bread, large bag of crisps and a chocolate bar or chips with cheese and lots of sauce.

Speeding is one of the biggest causes of deaths on UK roads, accounting for  per cent of all fatal accidents. Telematics insurance firm insurethebox studied customer data across the UK for men and women of all ages from the past five years. They discovered that in every region, and across almost all age brackets, men were more likely to exceed the speed limit than women. And it is the aposboy racersapos who are the worst behaved behind the wheel - with -year-old males speeding  per cent more than females of the same age. It is not until they reach their thirties that men begin to take their foot off the throttle, with the dference compared to women drivers dropping to  per cent. On average, men speed  per cent more than women, but women in their forties are found to speed two per cent more than their male counterparts. Insurethebox fit aposblack boxesapos to cars which tells them about the driveraposs speed, the time of day or night they drive, their motorway miles and driving style. The clever system, which is out of sight inside the car, uses a sim card to transmit data which is then analysed to see how safely a motorist is driving. It is designed to help reduce insurance premiums. Another measure of safe driving is the Bonus Miles given to insurethebox policyholders for good driving. The box studies acceleration, braking, total miles covered and stopping for rests on long journeys as measures for awarding Bonus Miles. Good driving behaviour can earn policyholders up to  Bonus Miles each month, which can be used supplementary to a driveraposs policy. And across the UK, once again the women came out as the most responsible, collecting  per cent more Bonus Miles on average than men. However, Scotland and Wales see the smallest dference, with women earning six per cent and nine per cent more than men respectively. The one road type where male drivers have the upper hand is motorways.

Buyers have paid up to £, for pets thought to have come from breeding farms. Many had the deadly, highly infectious canine parvovirus, along with worms and other diseases. Sellers advertising on well-known websites tell buyers to go to a car park at Maidstone Services on the M in Kent. One of the crooks, a tanned man in his s who wears a surgical mask and black gloves, is said to use aliases including Graham, Alan and Steve. Mae Goodwin, , from Tenterden in Kent, paid £, in cash for a Cavalier King Charles spaniel she called Barney – and it died of a virus eight days later. She said: “It’s just heartbreaking. The people selling these puppies must be caught.” Charities have had  reports from buyers, most in the past six months, with five dogs dying soon after being bought. They believe the crooks are operating in a gang. The RSPCA and charity Animal Protection Services have launched a probe. APS chief Jacob Lloyd said: “These are some of the worst cases I have ever seen.” "},{"url":null,"title":"surge holiday park campsite bookings","story":"NewsSurge in holiday park and campsite bookings as lockdown ease prompts staycationsOne office said they had received  calls in one morning - just hours after Boris Johnson said hotels, restaurants, campsites, pubs, cinemas and hairdressers could reopen from July  – providing they follow updated COVID- guidanceShareCommentsByPaul Greaves:,  JUN News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Two households will be allowed to meet indoors and stay overnight, Mr Johnson told MPs in the House of Commons. DevonLive spoke to a number of holiday parks, campsites and touring facilities today, the majority say demand has been staggering.Rachel Tearall, manager of the family-run Hele Valley Holiday Park in Ilfracombe, said the influx of calls had been unprecedented.Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blogWeaposve had something like  calls this morning, itaposs been absolutely crazy. People definitely want to come, we are just trying to get ready for them. I still have about , emails to get through which have been coming in over the past week. The enquiries are from all over the country - Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol. Hele Valley is a relatively small business which has a mixture of caravans, lodges, glamping and camping facilities. We have fty plus owners on the holiday park and they all want to come down, said Rachel. A lot of people want to camp and thereaposs also a demand from people who want to buy holiday homes. The camp, which was due to open in April, has been closed since the last holiday season finished. It will be quite a change because Iaposve pretty much had the place to myself for the last three months, said Rachel.  She said the safety of staff, visitors and locals will be her most important considerations. Iaposm happy as long as people abide by the rules we have to follow and are sensible while they stay here. We have a risk assessment in place that we have carried out according to the guidelines. We donapost have a clubhouse or communal areas so it is going to be quite simple to follow the rules. We wonapost be opening the campsite to tents as the toilet facilities are not suitable but weaposll allow motor homes. We will ask visitors to support local businesses, plan their deliveries from the supermarkets andthey donapost comply with the guidelines they wonapost be allowed to stay. Weaposll also make clear that a lot of locals are going to be a bit worried about so many people coming and they should be aware of how they behave. Fortunately many of our holidaymakers are in the older demographic and Iaposm confident they will be sensible. Weaposre going to open again July . Helen Scott, a director at Cofton Holidays, a large holiday complex in Dawlish, which has a mixture of static caravans, luxury apartments, cottages, clubhouse and swimming facilities, said they estimated that demand had swelled , per cent in  hours.  It started yesterday before he made the announcement and the phone hasnapost stopped ringing since, she said. Itaposs been chaotic, but in a good way. The reality is now starting to sink in that it will all start again on July  and we need to be ready. We are confident we can make sure it is all managed safely. We are just encouraging people to book online because the reception is not fully staffed yet due to furloughing. The bookings are mainly for July and August. Demand has gone through the roof. We can see hundreds of people are browsing for bookings online. Itaposs really important for us to remind everyone who comes to behave sensibly when they arrive. Online yesterday we did  bookings, which is the most weaposve ever done in a single day. Paul Scott, who runs Hunters Lodge Caravan and Camping site in Starcross, said it will be a relief to be open again before the summer is over. An awful lot of people around here rely on the holiday market and it would have been an awfully long winter without these few months of summer. Itaposs certainly been busy. We are only a small place but we took five of six bookings yesterday and a few more today. The phone has been ringing.  We wonapost have to make too many changes because we donapost have swimming pools or large toilet blocks. The people that come here donapost come for that. They enjoy the local pubs at Cockwood and using the cycle trail. But weaposve done the risk assessment and will have hand sanitisers and instructions for everybody to follow. Stephen Brown, operations manager at nearby Ladyaposs Mile, said: Here at Lady’s Mile our teams are working extremely hard to make sure that we have all the safety measures in place for our guests toto park on July . We are following all of the government guidelines to make sure we have a safe environment for our guests and staff. We are very aware that some local residents are concerned about visitors coming to Dawlish from dferent parts of the country and with this is mind we are limiting the amount of guests we are allowing on site. However, we are also aware that the local economy and our staff who are mainly from the local area rely on tourism.

Henry Long, , allegedly claimed he had been watching DVDs, including Fast and the Furious, with relatives at the time the officer Andrew Harper was dragged to his death behind a car. He allegedly said I donapost give a f*** about any of this, as he was charged with murder on September , jurors heard. The trio allegedly got rid of their mobile phones by the time police arrived at the travelleraposs site where they were arrested around  minutes after they ed from their getaway journey. Long remarked look at me, do I look like a murderer , as officers detained him, the court heard.  Prosecutors said he told clear and deliberate lies to distance himself from the horric killing. He later admitted manslaughter ahead of the murder trial. Mr Laidlaw said: Police began, in numbers, to enter the Four Houses Corner site at about :pm just  minutes or so after the three defendants had arrived back at the site in the SEAT. Henry Long along with Albert Bowers was found in a Fendt Diamond caravan in Plot  on the Four Houses Corner site. Neither man was found in possession of a mobile phone, and the police could not find any phone attributable to either defendant during their search of the caravan site. What becomes clear is that both young men had managed to get rid of their telephones - either by disposing of them or, as would appear more likely by passing them to other members of the travelling community who were not arrested.  Both were led away by other officers and at .am they were arrested again. Henry Long saying words along the lines of Look at me. Do I look like a murderer  At the start of his first police interview on  August , Henry Longaposs solicitor read out a prepared statement which Henry Long had signed. It was in these terms: I am not involved in this incident. I have never been to a house yesterday looking at Quad bikes. My fingerprints or DNA will not be on the quad bike. At pm I canapost remember exactly where I was but I got to Four Houses caravan site about .pm and I stayed there all evening until police came and arrested me. I was with my auntie Sammi Jo and her husband Sammy Smith. We watched DVDaposs. One was Goonies, Fast and Furious. I went bed I think around .pm. Police woke me up. I had been outside just for a cigarette but otherwise had not left. I do not believe that I have been  in a beige Seat Toledo.  I certainly have never been in it yesterday but there are numerous cars on the site. Mr Laidlaw said: Henry Long now accepts he was driver of the car. You may think, as against the evidence which the police were to gather, he has subsequently come to the conclusion that the pretence he was not involved was unlikely to be successful in front of a jury. It follows that in the prepared statement, he told clear and deliberate lies. He then made aposno commentapos to all the questions asked of him in that first interview, save for this one exchange. When asked about the SEAT that had been recovered, Henry Long said aposIf something happened and the car was found, say for instance in a housing estate, would everyone in that housing estate get arrested, or is it just a gypsy site where a car gets found, everyone gets arrested  "},{"url":null,"title":"top things brits settle second","story":"NewsTop things Brits settle for second best on - from cheap beer to le partnersA study of , adults revealed  per cent adopted a guess that will do approach because they either havent been able to afford better, or get what they really wantShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsPeople even admitted to settling for second best when it came to their le partners\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A study of , adults revealed % adopted a aposguess that will doapos approach because they either havenapost been able to afford better, or get what they really want. Incredibly, % of adults have found themselves in a relationship with someone they did not think was aposthe oneapos. Just over a tenth admitted doing so because they didnapost want to be left on the shelf with  per cent worrying they would never find love. A third have at some point accepted a salary which was far from ideal, with a fth feeling there was no room for negotiation and % hoping a pay rise might happen in the future. Of those polled, % have also accepted a job they did not want, largely because they couldnapost find anything better. A spokeswoman for Lottoland, which carried out the research in connection with their new Lotto Plus Multiple Millionaires Bonus draw, said: We know that people often want more out of le, and as such strive to do better, but the findings do indicate an acceptance that things canapost always be perfect. However, there should be some areas of le where you donapost settle for second best. It is human nature to want more - more fun, more spontaneity, and more choice - and thataposs why weaposre introducing more choice and more opportunities for our own customers. The study also found a house, friendships, and a car are among the other le changing things adults have settled for, when they really didnapost want to. Almost two thirdsof adults have ended up moving into a house which wasnapost their dream home, with money the chief factor. And % have found themselves in unhealthy friendships, with confidence cited as the main reason for not pursuing alternative relationships.  But when it comes to settling in le, not all decisions are le changing. Nearly four in adults have had to settle on a supermarketaposs own brand of food over something posher, while % have made do with a cheap restaurant rather than opting for fine dining. Choosing a slice of cake smaller than one would like, and deciding on the house wine over something a little more refined also feature in the top  list. Furniture for the home, haircuts, shoes and gts are also among the things Brits have chosen, despite wanting better. It also emerged three in  have settled for the price of something rather than negotiating, and % have resigned themselves to working long hours instead of meeting up with friends. Holidays, the area to live in, smart phones, and coffee also feature in the list as those things where sometimes, second best will have to do.  Researchers, from OnePoll, found two thirds of those polled DO want more out of le, and the same percentage say the older they get, the less likely they are to settle for anything less than perfect. Four in  adults will only settle on somethingthey really donapost have a choice, and  per cent said money is always the decisive factor. Being too relaxed, lacking confidence, and wanting to go with the flow are also reasons why Brits donapost push to get what they want all the time. Butthey had the choice and felt able,  per cent would like to improve their financial situation, while % want a better salary.

He did an exemplary job at St Johnstone and I would have no concerns about the Terrors under his stewardship.For now, the Tangerines will be licking their wounds, though, because this one will sting for a while.The sub-plot of Hearts’ legal action against the SPFL, which could threaten United’s promotion to the Premiership, is bubbling under the surface. While the rapid exit of Robbie for his former club doesn’t sit right with me.From a footballing perspective I can see how the move would make sense for Robbie and the Jambos – he’ll feel he has unfinished business there as a Hearts man.However, I think the problems might run a little deeper than Robbie wanting toto Gorgie.It could work out well for United, getting compensation and a new manager, of course, but there will be a lot of questions to answer from confused fans and staff alike.Just when it seemed things were settling down, United are back in disarray.It is, of course, not a positive situation for them right now but Dundee need to be thankful for what they’ve got.Last week’s statement from John Nelms will have sent shivers down the spines of Dark Blues scarred by two administrations since the turn of the century.It’s clear the coronavirus is going to have a huge impact on the club’s finances, and they are not the only ones, but they have to look at what they have in place as a huge plus.Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality\" title\"#Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-john-nelms-finances-future embed # secrettSsuFoaHq\" data-secret\"tSsuFoaHq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Boss James McPake has a playing squad which isn’t a million miles away from being ready, there is an insurance policy in place which could be a lesaver and, most importantly, the Americans are clearly committed to staying put at Dens Park.It was a realistic statement from Nelms but not a death knell or the end of his and owner Tim Keyes’ involvement with the Dee.They may have to curtail some of their grand plans, like the stadium, and might not be able to give McPake a huge budget but the club is in the safest of hands.I was bitterly disappointed with the Merseyside derby on Sunday.The quality on display just wasn’t there and without the fans, rival clashes inThe supporters make these games and watching such a massive game with fake fan noise in the background made for a strange atmosphere.This isn’t football. The sooner we get bums back on seats the better!I hope the financial impact of the coronavirus doesn’t lead to Dundee following Hibs in mothballing their academy.For me, times like this are when clubs should be investing in their young players.Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice \" title\"#Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp former-dundee-united-manager-craig-levein-would-never-say-never-to-tannadice- embed # secretjjsgqCov\" data-secret\"jjsgqCov\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But seeing how our wee community comes together in times of need is always inspiring. Everything from businesses volunteers adapting to supply frontline workers with much-needed supplies, to people volunteering to collect shopping and essentials for people shielding.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

undertaken by Glasgow Warriorsrsquo professional players.ldquoWhen yoursquore walking in and around Selkirk, you canrsquot help noticing pieces of litter that have been left lying around, often when proper bins arenrsquot that far away, said Nixon.ldquoI thought it would be a good idea for Selkirk players to take a bin bag with them when they head out to take their daily exercise, picking up any litter they see next to paths or along roadside verges.ldquoWersquore lucky in Selkirk to have such unspoilt countryside to exercise in, so itrsquos a shame to see it spoiled by discarded empty bottles, food wrappers and general rubbish.ldquoI kicked off the campaign by nominating three members of our players ndash Aaron McColm, Ewan MacDougall and Liam Cassidy ndash to collect litter on their walks.ldquoEach of this trio will then challenge a further three players to collect litter, and in turn these three will nominate other team-mates, and so on.The project has the backing of Selkirk head coach Scott Wight.He said: ldquoItrsquos another way the club can put something back into the local community, though this time therersquos no sponsorship involved.ldquoItrsquos looking asitrsquos going to be a wee while before any rugby is going to be played, so this latest effort not only helps keep the players in touch with each other, itrsquos also providing a useful service for the Selkirk community.Meanwhile, Selkirk Rugby Club is to stage its annual Players Presentation Night on Fridayndash although this yearrsquos event will be a lsquovirtualrsquo get-together.The plan is for the clubrsquos coaches, players and rugby officials to be digitally linked via Zoom, with Selkirk head coach Scott Wight taking charge of proceedings.ldquoThe idea is to try and stick as closely

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

These developed into Fleetsand Limeylandscollieries.These were linked, along with Carberryand Tynemount , to the North British Railway by the Garvald  Gford Railway.Wallyford, Whitecraig, Elphinstone, Ormiston and Macmerry all grew up to house miners working there.For - miners at each pit, working conditions were dreadful, being cramped, hot, dirty and dangerous.Mechanical diggers appeared around the time of the Second World War and pithead baths became universal only with the National Coal Boardin .The NCB dug new shallow mines like Wintonand Meadowmill , and the Monktonhall lsquosuperpitrsquo , but their future was short. All mines but Monktonhall were closed by .These forgotten mines offer more for our future than just Prestongrange Mining Museum.

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"former-mens-club-become-four-flats","story":"East Lothian Council has given the green light to East Lothian Propertyrsquos plans to transform  Sidegate.The former Haddington Recreation Club closed its doors in the early s and will now become home to a ground-floor office and four flats.The three-storey property is currently used as bedsit accommodation.One member of the public objected to the proposals on grounds including road safety, the likelihood that ldquothe use of the building to accommodate an office and four flats will lead to a large number of cars parking on street at this potentially dangerous spot and that the proposals ldquodo not accommodate any dedicated off-street parking, the consequence of which would result in cars being parked on the narrow road outside the building which would result in dficulties for other road users and would create a road safety hazard.Despite the objections, the plans were given the go ahead, with the planning officer noting that colleagues in the roads services department raised ldquono objection to the plans.Billiards, draughts and table tennis were all played by male members of Haddington Recreation Club before it closed.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgerwas described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

This was a logical result of the requirement by the government of clan chiefs sons to be educated in England or the Lowlands. It was the inevitability of insisting these Scots be forced to enter schools which to this day are the production line to leadership in government and the military. Hoist by your own petard comes to mind.It is an obvious fact that history is written by the victors. I would suggest thatmore Scots actually knew their history there would be a much greater feeling of anger aimed at the Parliament in Westminster. Of course we were involved in the slave trade, but so were the African chiefs who sold their countrymen to the slavers and the plantation owners, many of whom were freed slaves in later days. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Vikings and Moors all have history of slavery and Brazil only banned slavery in . I am not being deafened by their apologies.If you throw a stone into the wake of a boat it will alter the pattern of the waves in some way but it will not affect where the boat is going. It is the same with history. If you are willing to learn from it you can better move forward, but changing street names and pulling down statues benefits the future not one iota. I would suggest to Mr Smith that he should worry far more for the future of his unionist ideologyScots do give up victimhood, as the next logical emotion is anger.David Stubley, Prestwick.I AGREE with Mark Smith that Scots need to face up to their history, good and bad, but when I was at school I studied history for five years and the curriculum contained not one iota of Scottish history what I got was Henry VIII and his marital woes, the Battle of the Nile, the League of Nations and the Russian Revolution. I note that in his cherry picking of bits of Scottish history, Mr Smith has made no mention of the  Act of Union, when Scots rioted in the streets because their nationhood had been signed away, and the Speaker of the House of Commons declared \"We have catchd Scotland and we will bind her fast\".The past should serve as a lesson to the present, although that is a lesson which seldom seems to be learned sadly, the war to end war didnt, and in the st century UK foreign policy would appear to have learned nothing from past centuries, involving itself in foreign wars including an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, and to the UKs eternal shame, the illegal invasion and bombing of Iraq. Carl Sagan wisely said: \"You have to know the past to understand the present,\" and many would dismiss Henry Fords comment that \"history is more or less bunk\". But he went on to observe: \"It is tradition. We dont want tradition. We want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinkers dam is the history we make today.\" In making todays history, how we deal with present issues, many of which are rooted in the past, will determine our future and the future of generations to come that is what should concern us most of all.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOT that long ago the Scots actor David Hayman narrated an excellent BBC documentary on this countrys involvement in the slave trade entitled Scotlands Shame. The essence of the programme was that it related actual and authentic history, highlighting how the trade in human beings impacted every aspect of Scotlands economic, social and cultural le. In doing so it broke with the Great Man or Great Inidual view of history which so often trivialises serious history. The same approach has been adopted by Professor Sir Tom Devine.This authentic appraisal of the nations past is not an easy debate to have and it is important that it is conducted as objectively as possible. It is, however, related to another aspect of Scotlands history and one that remains important for many peoples view of their Scottish identity. When I was younger I, in common with millions of other Scots, listened uncritically to the song a Scottish Soldier. This relates the story of the Scot who soldiers far away and fights in many a fray. If I listened to the same song today I would do so much less uncritically and would be inclined to consider the origins of the Martial Scot.History is an interesting area of study but it is also something we can learn and progress from. After all, we dont need to go back to Britains imperial past to find examples of pointless, avoidable wars.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.MARK Smithrsquos article on how we view our history is interesting and perceptive, but may I take him up on one point . We talk, he says, ldquoabout our lonely imprisoned queens and not our brutal warrior kings. The sole member of the former set is easily identiable but whom has he in mind for the latter War is brutal anda king, whose supreme obligation is to protect his people, is faced with the choice of seeing his country overrun by a brute and adopting brutal means to prevent it, as was true ofRobert Bruce, then there is no choice at all. Robert III and James III, who failed to prevent the English from ravaging the Borders, are not highly regarded in our history. James IV was incontrovertibly one of our greatest kings but his reputation would have been higher stillhe had been capable of some brutality:while the English army was taking its position at Flodden he had followed his master gunnerrsquos advice to strafe them with his cannon. Had he done so he might well have ed alive, with much of his army, to continue his energetic rule over a prosperous and outward-looking European power ndash instead of, by chivalrously withdrawing from his strong position and allowing the English an orderly muster, dying in the course of a catastrophic defeat and leaving his realm to years of near-chaos under his infant heir.It is certainly true that Scotland played its full part in the discreditable history of British imperialism but prior to the Union, there is no question which of the two kingdoms on the island had the worse record as an aggressor power.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB."},{"url":null,"title":"passionate-music-fan-saw-prince-play-concert-3am","story":"Born: October , Died: May , .SEVEN years ago, having retired as a college lecturer, Colin Somerville was asked by a Scottish media website to list the  records that meant the most to him.His choices included artists as erse as the Allman Brothers, Lorraine Ellison, Prince, Jackie Leven and Captain Beefheart: together, they testied to his high-profile career and his lelong love of music.For Prince, for example, he recalled being sent to the musicianrsquos Paisley Park studio complex in Minnesota prior to a concert in Edinburgh. ldquoIt was a hoot, but seeing him playing to an exclusive audience of less than a hundred people at am will live on with this jaded cynic for a very long time.When it came to the Clash ndash ldquothe best rock band ever ndash he had seen them at Aberdeen University Student Union in . Years later, he had met Joe Strummer, the bandrsquos singer and guitarist, when he was DJ-ing backstage at T in the Park, at Strathclyde Park.

Didnrsquot go, a regret ever since.When it came to the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, he reminisced about hearing their music in Glasgowrsquos old Listen music shop, with its ldquoaircraft seats and headphones.Somerville, who has died at the age of , was an indefatigable and remarkably knowledgeable fan of music, a passion he latterly conveyed to students on the Creative Industries course at Fe College.During his long career he was a prominent figure at Radio Forth, where he spent  years. He also contributed music features to The Herald, was a presenter with the BBC, wrote for the Edinburgh Evening News, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday, and also worked at the radio station, Scot FM, in the s.Between  and , he was a member of this papers reviewing team at the Edinburgh Festivals, covering Fringe comedy with a keen eye for new talent as well as incisive criticism of established acts, and making recommendations for the Herald Angel awards. In the fetid atmosphere of the capital in August, he took a delight in not being swayed by publicity hype, and recognising acts with the promise of a sustained career.Colin Somerville was born in Comrie, Perthshire, in October , to William and Jacqueline, who ran a local hair salon. He was educated at Christrsquos Hospital in Horsham, West Sussex , and from a young age he decided to become a journalist. He was writing concert reviews for an Edinburgh newspaper at  and, like hundreds of hopefuls before and since, went to study journalism, at Napier College, in Edinburgh.In  he started working as a trainee news reporter at Radio Forth. At one point he was invited to take over a local music show, which he eventually made his own. The music coverage was steadily expanded one of the new shows, Forth Street, was originally presented by Somerville with Muriel Gray. He also become the stationrsquos music controller.He interviewed many celebrities during his time at Forth, among them August Darnell, otherwise known as Kid Creole. The pair of them once went into the well-known Edinburgh pub, Matherrsquos, with Darnell resplendent in a full zoot-suit, says Neil Cooper, an arts writer on The Herald.Adds Cooper: ldquoColin was a mighty broadcaster and writer, whose musical antennae was genius. He got me into the Edinburgh Evening News to do theatre reviews in the late s when he was running the arts and entertainments page, and became a mate who got me into more scrapes than I can remember.ldquoHe was wonderfully deadpan, witheringly cynical and glorious company, with a story about anyone and everyone. He taught me a ton. Listening to war stories of Edinburghrsquos music scene in the s, or  ear-wigging in on him doing a phone interview with someone, was an education.For the Herald Somerville wrote album reviews and music features, his knowledge and his passion on full display, and he also reviewed comedy shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.David Belcher, formerly a rock and pop music writer on the Herald, says: ldquoHe was enormously knowledgeable about music and comedy, and about most things. He was very wise and enthusiastic, and great fun to be around. He recalls going to Moscow for a weekend on a promotional trip, along with Somerville and a planeload of other journalists, to see the Scottish band, Big Country.ldquoI would meet him periodically at ious events, and he was the calm man at the centre of any storm that might be going on, for example when you were trying to get your name on a guest-list or retrieve your guest-list tickets.Somerville, who had a golden retriever named Iggy, after the colourful rock singer, Iggy Pop, was an enthusiastic reader of such writers as Hunter S. Thompson, Iain Banks and Ian Rankin he loved cooking but was ldquorubbish at DIY, says his son, Joe, who adds, ldquoHe was very interested in people and their stories. He passed on his love of sport to Joersquos brother, Jake, and his love of music and comedy to Joe and his sister, Rachel. Before his untimely death he was able to meet his granddaughter, Norah, who is now  months.Colin, who was twice married, contracted early-onset dementia several years ago, was being cared for at Manor Grange Care Home, Edinburgh. Recently it was reported that Fe College is planning to create a scholarship for new and emerging radio talent in his memory.Dougi McMillan, director of the Faculty of Creative Industries at the college, described Colin as ldquovery well respected, knowledgeable and connected throughout broadcasting, publishing ...the radio students and his colleagues alike adored him, all his le stories, anecdotes and laughter."},{"url":null,"title":"talking-heads-series-three-episodes-one-two-review","story":"****SPITTING Image used to portray Alan Bennett as a fussy old Yorkshire dear, forever having tea with Thora Hird and wittering on about summat and nowt.

But I want to stress that we are taking, and will continue to take, a cautious approach.ldquoOur aim remains maximum suppression of this virus because that is what will give us the firmest foundation to face whatever comes ahead.ldquoTo deal with outbreaks such as those wersquore seeing in other countries right now through targeted measures and also equip ourselves as best as possible to deal with any possible resurgence in the virus as we enter the winter months.: CMO warns health boards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityIn Scotland, Phase Three is currently scheduled to come into effect after July , paving the way for museums, cinemas, galleries, libraries, and hairdressers to re-open.It originally included indoor leisure facilities such as gyms and swimming pools, although these are now considered high-risk venues and have been ruled out of Englandrsquos July  relaxations.In Scotland, July  had also been announced previously as the date for the hospitality sector, including hotels, guest houses, BBs, pubs and restaurants, to resume trading.However, there has been mounting pressure on the Scottish Government to relax the two-metre physical distancing rule which hospitality bosses said would limit capacity for customers too much for some businesses to be financially viable.Ms Sturgeon said she is awaiting a review of the evidence by Scottish Government scientic advisors, having asked them to considerand how Scotland could reduce the physical distancing requirement ahead of the move into Phase Three.The findings will be reported on July , but Ms Sturgeon stressed that for now the two-metre rule remains in place in Scotland.\"The more we can continue to suppress the virus now, the more likely it is that we will be able to consider some changes to that rule,\" she said, adding that Scotland is \"not far away\" from eliminating community transmission of coronaviruscases continue to decline.Dr Gregor Smith, Scotlands interim chief medical officer, said this could be \"within reach\" over the next few months. Elimination means the virus is no longer spreading, rather than eradicated.: Scotland on safe side of pandemic as only one in  Covid tests comes back positiveMs Sturgeon, who confirmed  new cases and four deaths from the virus yesterday, said: \"The opportunity,you get it to that level of elimination, is that you can deal with imported cases on a much more targeted basis rather than facing the prospect of general blanket lockdowns again.\"Professor Devi Sridhar, an expert in global public health at Edinburgh University and a member of the Scottish Governments Covid Advisory Group, said an increasing number of countries around the world are \"trying to suppress the virus to a low level and, where possible, eliminate it before reopening their schools, shops and restaurants\".Writing in the , she said: \"As an island, Great Britain is in a strong position to eliminate the virus and fully reopen schools, bars and theatres as well as bringing back sports matches and weddings without pointless debates about one or two-metre distancing measures.\"Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said the two-metre rule was already preventing thousands of businesses from re-opening and called on the First Minister to urgently review the situation.Mr Carlaw said: ldquoTherersquos no doubt that where in the UK things are really beginning to happen. The risk now is that Scotland is left behind socially and economically.ldquoIt will be very dficult for people here to look on as England, and indeed the rest of Europe, begins ato normal.ldquoIt will also be very costly for businesses, industries like tourism and hospitality, and the mental health of the nation. The people of Scotland will not accept a go-slow approach from Nicola Sturgeon much longer.It came as the Prime Minister set out his mass unlocking plan for England, which will see pubs and restaurants reopen and allow customers inside and outdoors from next weekend.Hair salons, wildle parks, hotels and holiday homes will be able to open, provided they have created a Covid secure environment.: Swinney in colossal U-turn on school re-openingsMeasures could include putting up screens, having staff wear PPE, increasing ventilation, providing hand sanitiser and creating one-way systems through exhibits and shops.Crucially, Mr Johnson has also cut the two-metre social distancing rule to \"one metre plus\", which he described as \"one metre apart while taking mitigations to reduce the risk\". These include reducing the amount of time spent indoors with other people and wearing a mask on public transport.Two households of any size will also be allowed to meet up indoors under the plans, though they cannot hug.Conservative MP John Lamont said his constituents in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, would \"not get the benefits\" of the PMs measures \"as the First Minister of Scotland is delaying Scotlands release from lockdown.\"Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland added that Scotland \"must also start looking at how to open our economy safely.\"He said: \"Given the signicant fall in the incidence of the disease, and following the review from our scientic experts, the UK Government has taken cautious steps forward.\"I would urge the Scottish Government to also act quickly and decisively to help Scottish businesses get back on their feet.Nail bars, beauty salons, spas, nightclubs, indoor play areas, and tattoo parlours will remain closed in England, but places of worship will be allowed to hold services from July  - though singing, thought to increase risk of transmission, will be banned.Weddings with up to  people will be permitted, and customers to pubs and restaurants will be asked to leave their contact details in case the venue is subsequently linked to a positive case.Meanwhile Health Secretary Jeane Freeman confirmed that from July  all hospital staff working in specialist cancer units, long-stay mental health wards, and long-term care of the elderly wards would be routinely tested for Covid once a week as part of measures to limit transmission of Covid as NHS services are stepped up.Medical and adult care home staff who are in contact with patients or residents will be required to wear medical-grade face masks from Monday. Visitors and patients attending hospital for outpatient or day case procedures will also be required to wear face coverings.\"This new measure is designed to reduce the risk of transmission from the person wearing the mask or face covering,\" said Ms Freeman."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-economy-take-four-years-reach-new-normal-covid","story":"The Fraser of Allander Institute said Scotland was now in its ldquodeepest recession in living memory and the outlook was ldquohugely challenging.In its latest economic commentary, the Institute said that even under its ldquooptimistic scenario of continued Covid decline and an economic upturn, the economy would notto pre-pandemic levels until late  or early .Howeverthe crisis dragged on, and especiallythere was a second wave of infections and ato lockdown, it would be the biggest hit to livelihoods in a generation.:The revolutionary new vision for a post-Covid Scottish economyldquoWe estimate that this could mean the economy does not get back to pre-crisis levels until mid-, the Strathclyde University outfit said.The Institute said that, while the  per cent collapse in Scottish GDP since the outbreak was ldquolargely articial and entirely due to the lockdown, it would alter the countryrsquos business base forever.Director Professor Graeme Roy said: ldquoThe near % drop in economic activity in April for Scotland highlights the scale of the economic crisis that we face.ldquoSo far, as a result of the major government support initiatives that have been put in place ndash including around , employees furloughed or supported through the self-employment scheme ndash the impact of the full effects of the crisis have been dampened.ldquoSadly, it is only now once we start to switch the economy back on that the crisis will hit home with a raft of redundancies and business closures likely over the summer.ldquoIn looking to the future, there is one important take-away from all this.

Businesses across all sectors have a key role to play they must be flexible and willing to innovative as the country adjusts to a lower growth world. Leaders must use this time to think about the organisation they want to be in the future. We must take this opportunity to change businesses for the better.:Sturgeon expert warns Scottish economy to be worst in developed worldAt Holyrood last night, SNP MSP Alex Neil said ministers should spend an extra poundbn over the next year ldquoto be able to recover from the post-Covid economic crisis.The former health secretary said the Scottish Government should be able to borrow directly from the Bank of England ldquoon exactly the same terms and conditions as the UK Government.He said the existing fiscal framework should be thrown ldquoout the window.Mr Neil made the comments during a Holyrood debate on Scotlandrsquos economic recovery.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said more must be done to light a ldquoburning flame of hope for a better Scotland.However he welcomed proposals to guarantee secure jobs for young Scots for at least two years."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-strive-ensure-new-normal-entails-fairer-safer-society","story":"ldquoNormal is most certainly not a state to which so many in our society and globally, for instance the children in pre-pandemic poverty and their families, would wish to .What the ldquonew normal will be for them depends on us, the privileged ones.

Bit of a contradiction, though. Scotland can only realise Prof McDonalds vision by being independent, which he has previously opposed. Labour and Conservative governments at Westminster have sold off the very utilities which could have given a leg-up to ldquogreening our economies in the way proposed, and it isnrsquot likely they would change their spots. It is inconceivable that Scotland would have the economic leg-room to realise this plan as a ldquodevolved nation under the auspices of a rapaciously centralising Westminster.I do think Prof McDonalds view of the future is a good one, and I hope Scotland can attain it. Incidentally, we have been told for decades that we are ldquostakeholders in the economy through our pension funds, but these funds are invested to fulfil a fiduciary duty, not with ldquopublic good in mind.GR Weir, Ochiltree.Your front-page report on Mondaywas not only alarming, but harrowing, because for so many a new, scary chapter lies ahead, a chapter not previously experienced. This involves welfare, becoming a statistic for the first time, trusting and hoping the place of last resort, that of social security, will be there in the hour of need.Applying for welfare is a very daunting experience and for many it is alien, because for most who join the workforce, there is no need to familiarise oneself with the ins and outs of the welfare system, that is for others. So this will be a whole new chapter and one that will be daunting.The current system of welfare involves applying for Universal Credit and your article highlighting the research by Bath and Oxford Universitiescertainly exposed the downfalls of this system. It pointed to an unfair and thoughtless system of payments, and ndash confirming what opposition MPrsquos have been telling the Government for years ndash the view that Universal Credit should be reviewed, even replaced, with immediate effect. Perhaps two million new applications for Universal Credit, consequences of Covid-, will once and for all expose the shortfalls of this system to a Government at Westminster who must tackle this sector of the economy going forward.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  I look like a Holby City cast member in my mask","story":"Normally I pick up litter. Not today. The mask might have lain there for weeks, but it felt better to leave it for someone with rubber gloves to deal with. In the coming months, I suspect paper masks will become the new crisp packet or plastic water bottle, the leading litter offender of our times. Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us. Who ever thought we would be having this dialogue  It was a sobering moment, stark proof of how altered the world has become in a matter of months.The fabric visors I have on order are as non-medical as it gets, short of the Venice carnival. If Laura Ashley were still in business, I could have lurked unnoticed among the rails in one of these for days. Perhaps wisely, my husband has opted instead for the Ned Kelly look. With a hill-walking snood pulled up over his nose he looks dastardly, and warm. With the hottest days of the year approaching, wearers will be severely tested. It is no joke. On overheated buses, tubes and trains ndash often tropical even in winter ndash being cocooned behind cloth, wool or paper will raise temperatures to simmering point. Tempers might follow. This is no time, certainly, for the menopausal. It will be interesting to see what happensanyone finds it so unbearable a prospect that they dare to go bare-faced.So far the enforcement of lockdown measures has been largely consensual, the police working amicably to ensure peoplersquos safety. Butany passengers revolt or feel unwell when under wraps, who will handle that situation  Itrsquos simple enough to prevent refusniks getting on at the bus stop, but thereafter the driver cannot be expected to enforce the law. Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off. Learning to do that now will require mentally airbrushing out the red flags in the scene before us, be it perspex screens, the distance between tables, or a proleration of nosebags. Itrsquos not impossible, but it will be quite a feat.To get into training, Irsquove written this column while wearing a paper mask. Itrsquos not a flattering sight.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households. Further details to follow in coming days.July  — Outdoor sports to resume and shopping centres to reopen.July  —  Meeting  indoors with up to two other households to be allowed, with physical distancing and attention to hygiene indoor learning and childcare service to resumeholiday accommodation, museums, galleries, monuments, cinemas and libraries to reopen . This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis. But before you head for a drink, you#ll be able to get that much-needed chop at the hairdressers or barbers.Ms Sturgeon explained that other Phase Three plans, such as communal gatherings including weddings and funerals, will require further consideration. Changes to guidance around this is unlikely to take effect before July .The First Minister also confirmed Scotland#s aim to move away from blanket guidance for all shielding people, with hopes instead of more tailored advice.She said: #Our challenge, which is not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping this virus firmly under control.#If, at any stage, there appears to be a resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted — and we may need to go backwards.#To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include play areas within school grounds and the skate park in Kirkwall.From that date, the play area at the Pickaquoy Centre will be open, but the rest of the complex and surrounding grounds will remain closed.Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC’s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “I am very pleased that the gradual easing of lockdown allows us to reopen play areas throughout Orkney.“I am sure this will be welcomed by many children, young people and their families, especially as the summer holidays are fast approaching.“In line with Government requirements, we strongly advise that everyone follows hand hygiene and physical distancing guidance when visiting play areas.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, the global crisis of climate change is accelerating.ldquoWe have a once-in-a-letime opportunity to address these urgent challenges together itrsquos there for the taking.He said a green recovery was the only way out of the ldquoterrible situation of Covid- and the economic crisis, that would create resilience, jobs and prosperity ndash but the ldquowindow of opportunity is closing already.ldquoWhat is now happening is a real opportunity to make a change which will be remembered forever as the great leap forward, which really could be done, but it is now, it isnrsquot tomorrow, he said.Key priorities for investment and action in the UK include:ndash Insulating homes to make them warmer and cheaper to heat, as well as measures to ensure they do not overheat as temperatures rise, for example by improving shading through trees and ensuring better ventilation.There is also a need to boost the use of clean heat pumps and to bring in proposed standards now for new buildings to be low carbon and water efficient.ndash Woodland planting and restoring peatland to store carbon and protect against future climate risks such as flooding, restoring parks and planting trees in cities and towns.ndash Making it easier for people to walk, cycle and work from home, with investment in safe spaces for walking and cycling, more bike parking and shared bike schemes, and prioritising investment in G and broadband over improving the road network.ndash Increasing recycling rates rapidly and banning food and garden waste from going to landfill within five years.The committeersquos report also called for training programmes, for example for builders and plumbers to install heat pumps.And the highly skilled North Sea oil and gas workforce could be retrained and redeployed in areas such as technology to capture and store carbon emissions from power plants and industrial processes.The Government is also urged to encourage the public to stick with positive behaviours such as walking and cycling, and to invest in science and innovation in technology to help tackle climate change.The report also calls for any bailouts of polluting industry to have ldquogreen strings attached and for taxes to be used to drive emissions reductions ndash for example increases on fuel duty ndash with the potential for carbon taxes able to raise pound billion a year over the next decade.A Government spokesman said: ldquoWe agree with the committee that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. He said the UK was investing to deliver more offshore wind than any other country and to reduce emissions from homes and industry.And he said: ldquoWe believe that the actions we need to take to achieve our zero emissions target can help to deliver a stronger, cleaner, more sustainable and more resilient economy after this pandemic ndash and already there are over , UK jobs in low-carbon businesses and their supply chains.copy -.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

and the Oil and Gas Technology Centrehave announced todaythey will work together on the concept to deliver clean, sustainable energy for local consumption and export to the UK.It will focus on using renewable energy to power offshore oil and gas s while also producing industrial quantities of hydrogen.While project backers have hailed its “massive” opportunities, campaigners opposed to onshore windfarms claim it will lead to “further industrialisation” of the landscape.The announcement comes just a week after SSE Renewables approved a final investment of almost £ million in the Viking Energy windfarm project.Although the Viking scheme is said to be running “in parallel” with the energy hub, both projects depend on an interconnector going ahead, connecting Shetland with the UK#s energy grid.The hub is hoped to make West Shetland oil and gas assets achieve carbon net zero targets by  as well as providing five per cent of the UK#s low carbon energy by .Project leaders say it is an ambitious concept, marking a sht from Shetland#s traditional energy industries, with the hope to benefit the community, provide jobs and energy security, both locally and nationally.SIC leader Steven Coutts said: “This is exactly the boost that our economy needs at this time.“I am delighted that the project has moved so fast since the council set it up earlier in the year as the opportunities are massive and the engagement is very strong.“It is particularly important for our young folk and the wider community as we look to develop our workforce into the future.”SIC chief executive Maggie Sandison added: “The hub’s aim is to provide local communities and industry access to clean energy, reduce emissions and maximise the value of the region’s oil and gas sector during energy transition.“This project will create sustainable local and regional employment, which is of paramount importance in these dficult times.”The next stage for the project is a period of planning, early stage concept engineering, research and studies.  It will run for two to three years before any investment decisions are taken.Colette Cohen, chief executive of the OGTC said: “Energy hubs are an exciting concept, which have the potential to accelerate the transition of our industry to a net zero future, while also supporting the UK’s net zero ambitions.#Our objective at OGTC is to reduce the cost of developing and deploying technology to enable and accelerate the energy transition.#The energy hub concept is a priority, working in partnership with industry, the regulators and research organisations, it will accelerate the development of key technology to create an integrated energy future for Scotland and enable the region to transition to a hydrogen economy.”Douglas Irvine, project lead for the SIC said: “An essential part of our ambition is to ensure that the Shetland community’s energy requirements are integrated into the project, and community-scale schemes are encouraged as well as industrial-scale ventures.#The interconnector between Shetland and the Scottish mainland is important for the project, but only a part of a much wider integrated renewable energy solution for Shetland and for the region”.Sustainable Shetland, which was formed in opposition to the Viking Energy windfarm project has raised fresh concerns about the energy hub.Campaign chairman Frank Hay said alternative proposals for a gas fired power station remained a “far better” use of oil and gas technology than the hub’s proposalsMr Hay also said he felt the cost of the interconnector

He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England. Yesterday, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster said the Executive would also look at reinstating the summer free school meals voucher schemefunds were available."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3186331.jpg--.jpg?1592830393000\n","title":"free drive in cinema for ballee but get your tickets fast","story":"Ballee Playing Fields is set to be transformed into a drive-in cinema with FREE admission for all on Saturday th July.The movies on the bill are Trolls and .The event is being delivered by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council as part of the intergeneration, cross community St.ART project which is funded by the European Union’s PEACE IV Programme and is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .It will be a ticket only event and tickets are available through Eventbrite from Monday nd June.The afternoon showing of Trolls will take place at :pm and  will be shown at :pm so bag your tickets and get the popcorn ready.Sound will be transmitted via the car radio given to each car upon arrival, allowing passengers to tune in to the film at the flick of a switch.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Peter Johnston, said: We are extremely excited to host this Drive-In cinema in Ballymena and feel that it offers the perfect solution for an event when social distancing is required.“We have some great movies to show which will appeal to people of all ages and we know everyone will have a great time.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Events Calendar for coming months has been reshaped to reflect the ongoing public health guidelines around the prevention of the spread of Covid- – but there are plenty of things planned for our people to get involved with virtually.Tickets for the Drive-in cinema are limited and can be secured at both links belowhttps:www.eventbrite e drive-in-cinema-ballymena-tickets-https:www.eventbrite e drive-in-cinema-ballymena-tickets- "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3187815.jpg--.jpg?1592910110000\n","title":"deal in final stages for transfer of wrightbus land to people of ballymena","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and the former Wrightbus owners are finalising a deal for the transfer of  acres of land to the people of Ballymena.At a special meeting of Council on Monday night, Elected Members approved the sealing of the transfer of lands at the Lisnafillan site.Mayor Peter Johnston said: This is brilliant news for Ballymena and Mid and East Antrim as a whole.This site will play a vital role in our economic growth in the coming years and the timing of this announcement is even more signicant as we work to rebuild and recover our economy post-Covid.The proposed transformation of the lands into manufacturing space will be driven by the Council and we have already had strong interest from a number of major firms who would be keen to base their production here.These lands will be crucial in securing more jobs for our people and the growth of our advanced manufacturing sector in Mid and East Antrim.Councillor Gregg McKeen, who played a key role in discussions involving the transfer of the land as then Chair of the Borough Growth Committee, said: I commend the outstanding efforts and commitment of all those involved in this deal, which will protect and enhance our areas proud manufacturing legacy and heritage.While this process has taken longer than initially expected and has been hugely challenging due to a number of conditions placed on the deal, its great news we have negotiated to this position.

There are a lot more people around due to lockdown and the public has been fantastic, said Darren Harper, who was leading the CRS operation on Tuesday.For his colleague Kerry Whitehouse, who has been out searching for Noah until am, the plight of the missing teenager plays on her mind.We#re trained not to get emotionally involved, she said.But I have a -year-old daughter at home, it#s hard not to think about that.At one point, the CRS team is directed down an alleyway at the back of York Park to see a discarded pair of worn, navy blue boxer shorts and a solitary black sock, both of which were lying in front of an old shed with a yellow wall.As they were lted off the ground, Darren said: Anything we find we bag as evidence and hand it over to the police.It was an overcast, muggy day as small teams of selfless volunteers continued to comb the area.Many have gone down streets they have never previously walked and across parks they haven#t frequented for years.Others have looked, then looked again, into sheds, outhouses, derelict buildings, gardens, back alleys, scrubland virtually anything that constitutes a nook or cranny.For some, it is their first time in this part of Belfast. They have come from all over the city, and beyond.The searching has been overnight, incessant, widespread and impressively coordinated, to ensure every inch is covered.Volunteers formed teams, then fanned off in dferent directions, knocking on doors, asking about possible sightings, urging an almost forensic search of inidual houses.The PSNI are conducting their own investigations, on foot, in vehicles and in the air.Social media is playing a crucial role, too who hasn#t already posted, shared or retweeted something about this missing boy from the south of the city Every parent knows the gut-wrenching terror that ensues from not knowing where your child is, evenit is for just a few seconds in a supermarket.It is therefore unimaginable what Fiona Donohoe is going through right now, as the hours and days tick by and Noah, her only child, remains missing.All she can do is appeal for witnesses to come forward surely someone saw a young boy, who happened to have his top off, in or around the Northwood Road Premier Drive area, on or since last Sunday evening Every time the phone rings, her hopes rise. But although messages of heartfelt support are always welcome, she would swap it all for the one call that would end the agony.Issuing a fervent appeal on day three of his disappearance, Mrs Donohoe said she was baffled by the lack of eyewitnesses. Her sister Niamh Donohoe, who was out searching for her nephew on Tuesday, described him as a great wee boy and said they are desperate for answers.We#ve no idea what has happened, she said. We would ask the public to think about whether they#ve noticed anything unusual recently.One woman thought she heard crying at midnight ... information like that could be extremely helpful.North Belfast is often cited as a #ided# area it was only a couple of days ago local folk were discussing sectarian stre at Grove Playing Fields.But the community#s collective resolve in searching for Noah has forsaken all barriers. Tribalism can wait, this can#t.Volunteers gathered at the Limestone Road interface to get instructions from team leaders. The Hubb Community Resource Centre, on the Shore Road, became a place where those involved in the search could partake of refreshments.Many children will be hugged a little tighter tonight. Parents are hoping - and some vigorously searching - so that Noah#s mum can ultimately do the same.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandPlease find my boy, begs Noah#s distraught mumThe distraught mother of missing schoolboy Noah Donohoe fought back tears as she appealed for the safeof her son.Most ReadPolice appeal for public to search homes, gardens and unused vehicles for missing Noah Donohoe Noah Donohoe: Community determined to reunite boy with family, says teacherUnionist anger as republicans rename Belfast streets and Queen#s University after IRA womanPolice say missing Noah Donohoemay have head injury after abandoning clothing Bobby Storey led  Provo probe into Massereene Real IRA killing ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -year-old has been appointed the first female canon of St Columb#s Cathedral in Londonderry in its -year history.She says she is humbled and honoured by the appointment, announced on Thursday, and also sort of excited.Katie was ordained within the Church of Ireland in June . She spent her curacy across the border in Letterkenny before moving to the Christ Church, Culmore, Muff and St Peter#s group of parishes in Derry, where she is now pastoral director. Katie is also the current Diocesan Chaplain of Derry and Raphoe Mothers# Union and editor of n:vision, the diocesan magazine. A native of Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, Derry has been home for Katie since  when she came to the city to study English at Magee University. She went on to marry Fergus McAteer , an accountant, and the couple have four sons, four daughters-in-law and seven grandchildren. Prior to ordination, she taught in schools but after a fire in Christ Church in , she became heavily involved in fundraising efforts. That led to a call towards ordination and the start of her training at the Church of Ireland Theological College in Dublin. Katie#s appointment to the chapter of St Columb#s was announced on Thursday by the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Andrew Forster. Rev Robert Boyd, rector of Glendermott and Newbuildings parishes in the city, has also been appointed a canon.By happy coincidence the news was revealed on the Feast Day of St John the Baptist - the anniversary of both new canons# ordinations.They will fill the positions left vacant following the departure of the Ferry brothers - Canon David, who has retired, and Canon Malcolm, who has moved to Agherton Parish in Portstewart. For Katie, she is following in the footsteps of her late father, Rev GVM Robinson, who was a Canon of Chester Cathedral. She said: When Bishop Andrew first asked me, I was totally taken aback. It was never on my radar, never in a million years - or even  years - would I have expected the bishop to ask me to accept this appointment.I#m someone who likes to keep her head down and not to seek the limelight. I#m happy in pastoral ministry and taking my place in the liturgy of the church. Bishop Andrew is the real history-maker as he is the one who asked me but I have to accept that I am as the first female canon in the cathedral#s  year history. St Columb#s, probably more than any other cathedral, has been a history-maker - the first cathedral built in these islands after the Reformation playing a leading role as a place of reconciliation - and now another brick is being laid in its rich history.Explaining the dfering emotions, Katie added: I still keep thinking, #No, not me. It can#t be me#. It#s exciting and quite daunting. I#m humbled and honoured.Throughout ministry, whatever God calls us to do, we pray that He will give us #the needful gts of grace# to fulfil that ministry. I#m hoping that this is at God#s direction I can only do this in God#s strength.While this is new territory for Katie, the second new canon is on familiar ground. Robert was a canon of St Patrick#s Cathedral in Armagh until three years ago, a position he relinquished when he moved to Derry and Raphoe, where he is also Diocesan Director of Ordinands. Due to Covid- restrictions, a date for their Service of Installation in St Columb#s has yet to be fixed but it is hoped it will take place in the early autumn.

It#s all about reducing the risk as much as possible, he said.With the easing of lockdown you increase your chance of exposure, but the advantage we have in Northern Ireland is that the rate of disease - what we call the prevalence - is low.He was optimistic the contact tracing system would be effective in the event of a second spike, as Northern Ireland was the first UK region to establish a system and had a relatively low number of cases.That#s certainly a crucial measure to make the easing of lockdown as safe as possible, he said.When we look at Germany and see that abattoir town which has had to go back into lockdown, we fully appreciate thata part of Northern Ireland develops a lot of infections the area will have to go into lockdown again.Dr Black added that a daily reporting system from GPs on patients who develop Covid- symptoms meant any localised outbreak should be spotted quickly.Meanwhile, Green Party MLA Rachel Woods accused the Executive of having a scattergun approach to easing lockdown which risked undermining public confidence.There are glaring anomalies between the Executive#s Coronavirus Recovery Plan and what has actually happened, she said. The five stages of the plan haven#t been followed in a linear way and the recovery plan isn#t joined up with. For example, non-essential retail reopened before restrictions on childcare provision have been relaxed.She questioned why reopening had been fast tracked for certain sectors - such as restaurants, cafes and pubs, which were originally set out in step five of the recovery plan - but not for non-contact sport, which was set out in step two.While recognising the Executive was following medical and scientic advice, she questioned why this was not available to the public. This, coupled with the Executive#s approach to reopening, creates the impression that the plan is being rewritten on the hoof, according to which sector can shout the loudest, she added.The lack of supporting, detailed guidance even covering the basics makes it increasingly dficult for those sectors who can reopen to do so with confidence around safety.In an open letter which was published in the British Medical Journal, health leaders from a range of organisations in the UK said an urgent review was needed to prevent more loss of le during the winter months.This follows an announcement from the Prime Minister Boris Johnson that pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers may open from July . The two metre distancing rule is to be replaced by a one-metre plus rule, allowing people to stand one metre apartnecessary.Sir David King, a former chief scientic adviser, told Sky News he believed the latest measures were extraordinarily risky and said he believed that the Prime Minister had acted too quickly.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ec-d-da-cf-efda_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus masks company ‘should be withdrawn pending investigation’A company which conducted improper tests on masks protecting staff against coronavirus should be withdrawn until investigation is complete, nurses said.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland cdff .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_abe-ca-ab-be-bdfb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandPlans to reopen schools could changenumber of Covid- cases declinesContingency plans to reopen schools in Northern Ireland could changethe number of Covid- cases continues to decline, the Education Minister has said.Most ReadPolice appeal for public to search homes, gardens and unused vehicles for missing Noah Donohoe Unionist anger as republicans rename Belfast streets and Queen#s University after IRA womanNoah Donohoe: Community determined to reunite boy with family, says teacherPolice say missing Noah Donohoemay have head injury after abandoning clothing Bobby Storey led  Provo probe into Massereene Real IRA killing ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Earlier, the south Belfast mother-of-one told the Belfastof her anguish and pleaded for just one person to provide information that could bring Noah home safely to her.No one has come forward to say they saw him, said Fiona.I#m pleading with you, the public, did you see a young half naked boy on June   I need to knowthere were any eyewitnesses, so please come forward.You may think it#s insignicant but it could turn out to be really relevant. Please, please tell the police anything you know.She added: Someone must know where he is.

Please thinkit was your child I would let them search my home from top to bottom.Supt Clark said officers believe Noah may have fallen off his bicycle and injured his head, causing him to become disorientated. Police said the teenager got back on his bicycle, cycled into Northwood Road and took off his clothes.He was later seen cycling naked, before then dropping his bicycle and walking towards a densely wooded area.The detective asked members of the public to check their washing lines for missing items.We are working on the hypothesis that Noah may have suffered some injury, causing him to behave in a way that is not normal, Supt Muir said.He may be seeking either shelter because he has no clothing or money, or he may not realise where he is.That is why it#s so important for members of the public to check their properties and cars.A massive police operation, including the use of a search and rescue dog and a helicopter, has been ongoing since Sunday.Police ers were also deployed on Tuesday to check drains in north Belfast.Noah#s skateboarding helmet, bicycle, Nike trainers, blue tie-dye hoodie and his mobile phone have been found. But police have not yet recovered his khaki green North Face jacket, grey sweat shorts and his khaki rucksack, which contained a Lenovo laptop.Despite hundreds of volunteers coming forward to help, no trace of Noah#s whereabouts has emerged so far.A former teacher of the schoolboy, who also joined in the search, said they were determined to reunite Noah with his loved ones.Caity Brown, who taught him at St Malachy#s while she was on placement as a music teacher, said he was a fantastic cello player and a usual teenage boy.We are basically just here doing our bit to bring Noah home to his friends and family, she said. I know everyone is so worried... it is absolutely phenomenal, seeing our communities come together to find a child. Because there is nothing more important than that.Sean McCarry, of the Community Rescue Service , is also asking the public to check their homes.There#s a very good chance that Noah#s confused, doesn#t understand who he is, he said.We#re working on the assumption that he#s gone to find shelter somewhere - in bushes, under a hedge, in someone#s garden shed, or even in their house. He could#ve walked in through an open door.He#s a not a danger to anyone. We#re asking people to check their homes.He added: We don#t know what#s going on with Noah, but we do know this is totally out of character.Darren Harper, who was leading a CSR team, said they were overwhelmed by the number of people who had joined in the search. It#s a great effort so many people are out helping because they are available due to the lockdown, he said. Another CRS voluneer, Sean McMullan, said there was a great sense of community support for the ongoing search.Everyone wants to find Noah, he said. There is a lot of effort going into trying to bring this child home to his family.Noah#s mother meanwhile, was flanked by two aunts, Shona and Niamh, at the press conference on Tuesday. They fought back tears as they heard Supt Clark say that everyone is incredibly concerned for his safety.The policeman appealed to Noah directly to say he was not in any trouble and he also asked the teenager#s friends to contact police with any information, no matter how trivial. This behaviour is completely outside of Noah#s normal character, he said.Noah#s aunt Niamh said during the early part of the search on Tuesday that her nephew was a great wee boy.Noah loves school, he loves his friends, he#s a complete dote, she said.She also said his family is desperate for answers.We have no idea what has happened, she said.We would ask members of the public to think about whether or not they#ve noticed anything unusual recently Have you heard any noises  One woman thought she heard crying at midnight... information like that could be extremely helpful to the police.Councillors Dean McCullough and Jim Crothers have both asked the community to knock doors and search surrounding areas.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandCommunity#s collective resolve in searching for lost schoolboy Noah Donohue has forsaken all barriersSuddenly, north Belfast seems like a terryingly huge place.Most ReadPolice appeal for public to search homes, gardens and unused vehicles for missing Noah Donohoe Noah Donohoe: Community determined to reunite boy with family, says teacherUnionist anger as republicans rename Belfast streets and Queen#s University after IRA womanPolice say missing Noah Donohoemay have head injury after abandoning clothing Bobby Storey led  Provo probe into Massereene Real IRA killing ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Meanwhile, a number of income streams are effectively cut off as hotels are still unable to stage weddings and spas are restricted.Strict social distancing controls are likely to be reduced soon by the Executive from two metres to one, after Prime Minister Boris Johnston relaxed the rules in England earlier this week.It follows repeated calls from the hard hit hospitality, services and tourism sectors, as the roadmap to reopen the region gathers pace.Northern Ireland#s food-serving pubs, restaurants and hotels are gearing up to reopen on July , while hairdressers will have their scissors at the ready on July .Ken McClure, vice president of the Northern Ireland Hairdressers Association, said most salons would find price hikes unavoidable.Prices will have to go up by around £ per person to offset the additional costs we#ll incur to reopen safely, he told the Belfast .Owners will need to provide personal protection equipment , hand sanitisers, perspex screens and take other safety measures.Mr McClure, who owns Kenneth Michael International Hair and Beauty in east Belfast, said they would have to spread out appointments so that there will be fewer clients at any one time to comply with social distancing rules.There will be a very limited waiting area and we#ll be asking people to come alone, he added.We#ll also have to consider putting up extra pegs for clothes and wash gowns after every use.Colin Neil of Hospitality Ulster said it is hard to predict what effect increased costs and social distancing will have on pricing.He added: Pubs are looking at new business models and trying to work out how they break even.Mr Jack, a renowned publican, said the price of a pint will increase.I can see prices going up because of the cost of security required to keep numbers below a certain capacity, he said.The Duke of York and Harp Bar are both busy non-food, live music venues and I#ll have to operate at somewhere between % and % capacity.A pint might increase from £. to £. That#s also to avoid dealing with change. A glass of wine will probably stay the same price.Any publican who reopens will probably be losing money for the rest of the year.Mr Magorrian, whose bars include the hugely popular Northern Whig, said he was reviewing all prices both to reflect increased costs and for safety reasons.We need to move away from £. and £. and go to £. or £ to cut down on the level of change we#re carrying, he said.The cheapest bottle of wine in the Whig is £., whereas a glass is up by p to £. or £.He added: The major thing we#ll be doing is avoiding deals such as two courses for a set price mid-week, or kids eat free on a Sunday, or cocktail happy hour.Julie Hastings, marketing director at Hastings Hotels, whose portfolio includes The Europa and Grand Central in Belfast city centre, said prices will stay static.Prices at each of our seven properties are being kept very much the same as pre-lockdown to encourage as many bookings as possible, she said.Hospitality chief Michael Stewart, who co-runs House Belfast hotel, bar and restaurant, said it#s inevitable that a lot of venues will have to increase prices to sustain the costs they incur.He added: For hotels it#s a moving feast so nobody knows. If the Chancellor reduces VAT in the next budget it will give us room for manoeuvre on prices. Ms Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion, said that price hikes are likely, although she pledged: I won#t be putting up mine.She added: Others may have no option but to increase their prices given all the extra costs incurred in complying with the new safety rules.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background.

Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background.

Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post. McEvoy also felt that the break gave injured quartet Paddy Kelly, Mark Craig, Eamonn McGill and Darragh McCloskey time to recover, while he hopes they can get through the -week club championship period unscathed. googletag.cmd.push “We are going to respect the club window,” he stressed. ”All the players are going to be playing a lot of matches. Thankfully they are going to be getting three or four matches each, before they get into semi-finals and finals. “We have to look at this as a positive, they will be back hurling and their club managers will be working with them in terms of hand to eyeand doing lots of ball work. “When we get the green light in mid-September, well start back working with them and looking forward to that. It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post. McEvoy also felt that the break gave injured quartet Paddy Kelly, Mark Craig, Eamonn McGill and Darragh McCloskey time to recover, while he hopes they can get through the -week club championship period unscathed. googletag.cmd.push “We are going to respect the club window,” he stressed. ”All the players are going to be playing a lot of matches. Thankfully they are going to be getting three or four matches each, before they get into semi-finals and finals. “We have to look at this as a positive, they will be back hurling and their club managers will be working with them in terms of hand to eyeand doing lots of ball work. “When we get the green light in mid-September, well start back working with them and looking forward to that. It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Baby Michael MacHugh shocked his mum Sara and dad Conall in January of this year by arriving  weeks early. His parents were told that he had a % chance of survival. Michael ended up having to spend  weeks in hospital. During this time, Tinyle, a charity which supports families of premature babies, was a vital help to Sara and Conall. Michael is now at home and doing well but his family were keen to raise money for Tinyle. googletag.cmd.push Michael’s uncle Caolan , his dads identical twin, agreed to shave off his fair to support the charity.  Caolans friend, Owen Brady, also agreed to so the same thing, and, between them, the two men have managed to raise more than pound, for the charity. Michaels mum said it had been dficult time for their family. “Michael was born on th January  at  weeks + days gestation,  weeks early, weighing just lb oz. “He is now over lb at  weeks old. “His due date was th of April . Michael was born in Altnagelvin at .am and transferred to The Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast at pm that same day. googletag.cmd.push “He spent five and a half weeks in the Royal where he received four of his five blood transfusions and spent the last seven and a half weeks back in Altnagelvin, where he got his last blood transfusion. “During this hospital stay I was also told that a baby born at  weeks has a % survival rate, defying all the odds Michael is with us now, thankfully a happy healthy  week old. “He is smaller than other babies his age and developmentally has some catching up to do but he is a little fighter.” Sara said Tinyle had been a great support to them. “During our stay in hospital TinyLe were a huge support and continue to be there for us, by way of thanks we wanted to raise funds for the charity and so lockdown presented the perfect opportunity. “As lockdown has rolled on Michael’s uncle Caolan, his dads identical twin became increasingly in need of a visit to the barbers, we used this to our advantage and challenged Caolan to a head shave. “Caolan’s friend Owen Brady also braved the shave,” she added. “Our family and friends rallied their support and I’m delighted to say we have raised over pound, for for TinyLe.” Valerie Cromie, Head of Fundraising for TinyLe , said the funds raised would be put to good use. “We are greatly indebted to the MacHugh family for their generosity and to Caolan and Owen who were brave enough to take on the head shave challenge. “Funds raised will ensure families who experience the birth of a premature baby receive the practical and emotional support they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patricia McCallion, who shot to fame on dating show Pretty Single, said she has used her unexpected down time to reboot and put the finishing touches to her first hair care range. I really enjoyed having that time to myselfand spendingtime with my daughter, but now that we can reopen Im very excitedto get back to work, she said. Pretty Single brought togethersix gorgeous single women who agreed to be stripped of their make-up before going on a series of blind dates. googletag.cmd.push  Patricia won the public over on the show with her bubbly personality and natural good looks and although she didnt manage to find love she says she has found friends for le. I still chat to my final two fellas on the show but its on a friendship basis, she said. I did go on a second and thirddate with Martin the barber, but I realised we are more like friends. I talk to the girls every single day though. Theres notmany times you get a group of girls togetherand everyone justgets on so well. Everybody is buying each othercards and presents on their birthdays- its lovely. googletag.cmd.push Since taking part in the show, Patricia has embraced a more natural look. I think Ive found lovely new friends and Ive found myself too, she said. I havent worn make-up in three weeks. I wouldnthave gone out the door before without running a make-up brushover my face. Itwas just the norm, like brushing my teeth. So its been very liberating. Earlier this month, Patriciafulfilled her lelong dream of launching her own hair care products, which are named Glam after her salon in Waterloo Street. It features two luxurious ranges SOS and Peyton, named after her  -year-old daughter. I started hairdressing at  and after Peyton was born working and being successfulwas all for her, she explained. I wanted her to be proud. Patricia was able to use lockdown to put the finishing touches to the range and she is delighted with the finished products. Getting to make the products was so educational but there was so much work involved in it, she admitted. Im so thankful that I had that time to properly work on it because I never thought it would be that stressful. I was nervous about it, but I have learnt to trust in myself. My clients trust that when I bring out a product I will have trialled it and tested it on myself and I have been doing hairdressing so long that I know what works.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding is part of the Departments Major Capital Works Programme which will see nine schools in total benefit from improvements to their sites. St Patricks College, Maghera, and St Conors College, Kilrea and Clady are the two County Derry schools who will receive funding. Speaking today in the Assembly, Education Minister Peter Weir said the investment showed the Department was planning for the future. Improving the schools’ estate is one of my priorities and in the current unprecedented and dficult times, he said. googletag.cmd.push I hope this will send a strong signal to the local construction industry and local communities that the Department of Education is planning for the future and is committed to supporting the local economy and the wider community through the delivery of our capital programme. My Department’s capital programme aims to ensure that all our young people are educated in school facilities which are safe, secure and fit-for-purpose, enabling them to receive the quality education experience required to help them to fulfil their potential. St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

Castledawson man Joe O’Kane posted a photograph online last week revealing a message his son had discovered while working on his aunt’s house in the Ballymena area. The message, decoratively presented in a sketched scroll, read: “Papered by Jack Kerr, King St Magherafelt. Painted by Joe Hughes of Moneyglass. The message also states that the named final member of the decorating crew done sweet f**k all! Jack Kerr was a painter who lived in King Street in the town and worked at the time for Seamus Keenan of Castledawson. He also ran a shop for a period on the street where he lived. googletag.cmd.push  Jack Kerrs shop on King St in Magherafelt. His brother, Dermot, said the practice of leaving a message was common. “That was a favourite thing to do down the years,” he told the County Derry Post. “I mind working in the Rectory in Magherafelt when I was at the painting too away in ’. Reverend McGonagle was coming in. “I came on a boy’s name from Aghagaskin, Surgenor I think it was, and it was written way before the turn of the century.” The practice led to Dermot making a remarkable discovery of coincidence as he peeled back some wallpaper in the late s. googletag.cmd.push “I was working on a job near the Loup – they were doing repairs and I was doing the painting for it. I started digging off the wallpaper in the hall of this farmhouse,” he said. “It was big, respectable farmhouse, about  acres. I wasn’t there an hour until I came across names on the ceiling, under the ceiling paper. “It was my father’s name. I was doing the job on Monday, May  in  and I came on my father’s name from May , .” Jack Kerr, second from the right in this  ODonovan Rossa Old Crocks team. The Kerrs were also a musical family, with one particular instrument appealing to the brothers. “Jack played the trumpet and saxophone and his brother Desmond played the saxophone and clarinet. Another brother, Albert, in Castledawson, played the saxophone too,” said Dermot. “Jack played in the Northern Swing Orchestra and they were always on that pantomime in the town, but it stopped in  when Fr Owen died. “I started with the brass band when I was  in the town, an independent brass band, but then I started to play football and forgot about the brass band.” Dermot Kerr was also able to shed some light on the identity of his brother’s colleagues and said Leslie Hepburn did a little more than the pencilled message suggests. Joe Hughes was originally from Moneyglass but now lives in Dunloy, County Antrim, and told us about the process of leaving their mark. “You went in and stripped the wall and before you papered it, you put a scroll on it and wrote the names on it,” he said. “I would have worked with Jack at the time, but It was Seamus Keenan we worked for and that was our trademark when we were in doing them up. It’s many a house you would see that on!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend Katie McAteer’s appointment to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of St Columb is one of two announced today by the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Reverend Andrew Forster. Reverend Robert Boyd, the Rector of Glendermott and Newbuildings Parish, has also been appointed a Canon.By happy coincidence, today - the Feast Day of St John the Baptist - is the anniversary of both new canons’ ordinations. Rev Boyd and Rev McAteer will fill the positions left vacant following the departure of the Ferry brothers – Rev Canon David, who has retired, and Rev Malcolm, who has become the Rector of Agherton Parish in Portstewart. googletag.cmd.push Rev McAteer, who is the Pastoral Director of the Christ Church, Culmore, Muff and St Peter’s Group of Parishes, said she was humbled and honoured by the appointment.“When Bishop Andrew first asked me, I was totally taken aback,” Rev McAteer said. “It was never on my radar, never in a million years – or even  years – would I have expected the Bishop to ask me to accept this appointment. “St Columb’s Cathedral, probably more than any other cathedral, has been a history-maker – the first cathedral built in these islands after the Reformationplaying a leading role as a place of reconciliation – and now another brick is being laid in its rich history. googletag.cmd.push “I still keep thinking, ‘No, not me. It can’t be me.’ It’s exciting. It’s quite daunting. I’m humbled and honoured.” Rev McAteer, whose father was a Canon of Chester Cathedral, evoked the words of the Ordination Service. “Throughout ministry, whatever God calls us to do, we pray that He will give us ‘the needful gts of grace’ to fulfil that ministry. I’m hoping that this is at God’s direction I can only do this in God’s strength.” While this isnew territory for Rev McAteer, the second new canon is on familiar ground. Rev Boyd, was a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh until three years ago, a position he relinquished when he was appointed incumbent of the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings. He has since taken up the role of Diocesan Director of Ordinands for Derry and Raphoe. “I feel very privileged and very honoured by the appointment,” Rev Boydsaid.  “I’m extremely grateful to Bishop Andrew for having the confidence in me to appoint me to this role and for thinking me worthy of it. I think it’s an honour, too, for the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings, so I’m very pleased that our parishioners are also being acknowledged and recognised by the Bishop.” The installation of a new canon is a signicant and joyful occasion for any cathedral but given its uniqueness, the forthcoming Service of Installation in St Columb’s – with its historical first – will arouse considerable interest within the Church of Ireland and beyond. A date has yet to be fixed for the Service but it is hoped it will take place in the early autumn. St Columb’s Cathedral, which was completed in , was the first Anglican cathedral built in the British Isles after the Reformation in .

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

This season, Lecale said goodbye to Year  swimmers Chloe Galloway, Sarah Colgan, Peter Murphy and Tom Rodgers.Coaches, committee and club members thank them for their long and dedicated association with the club and look forward to hearing about their successes in the future.The club also wishes to thank the outgoing captains, Chloe Galloway and James Kane, for their dedication and service to the club this season.Lecale Swimming Club continues to take their lead from the governing bodies, Swim Ireland and Swim Ulster, and look forwards to welcoming swimmers back to training before too long and new members when the next season starts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Mr Joseph McMcIlmail  ","story":"MR Joseph McIlmail, of Crew Road, Downpatrick, died peacefully at home on Tuesday, April , at the age of .Joe, as he was known to his family and many friends, was the fourth child of the late John Joe and Margaret McIlmail, from Bright.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

Please try again later.Submitting...Belfast Bank branch managers were advised in an official circular - “It is not the intention to merge the Northern Bank with the Belfast Banking Company, but as opportunities occur in the future it will be possible to effect some rationalisation to the advantage of all concerned.”Late  saw the arrival into both banks of a team from Midland Bank with the aim of bringing their systems into line with each other.On November , , staff were informed of the creation of ‘United Northern Banks Limited’ to later complete the integration of the two banks.Press advertising started the following week.On November ,  newspaper ads appeared promoting the name of ‘United Northern Banks Limited’ as ‘the big new name in Irish banking’.This holding company, registered in Northern Ireland, was to promote a gradual harmonising of methods and services, thus fostering closer co-operation between the two banks.At that stage there were  offices of both the Belfast Banking Company Limited and Northern Bank Limited.It would take until late  for their directors to decide on the name of the future organisation.A process of legal changes involving Acts of Parliament on both sides of the border would be required and then there was thenote-issuing rights that dated back to Victorian times.A separate rd company would not be able to retain the note-issuing powers currently held by both banks.A Private Bill was to be enacted in the Parliament of Northern Ireland that would allow the merger of the two banks on July ,  without the use of the third company.The Belfast Bank Executor  Trustee Company would also be merged into the Northern Bank Executor  Trustee Company at the same time. When enacted, the Bill would see the Belfast Bank branches known as ‘Northern Bank Limited, Belfast Bank Branch.’ Branch managers were advised on June  that July ,  ‘will be a happy and memorable day for all of us’.All Managers, Sub-Managers, Pro-Managers and Cashiers were to wear red carnations as ‘something eventful is happening in our bank’. An anonymous slip of paper arrived in branches and departments with the circulars the next day announcing, ‘black ties should be worn’.Northern Bank continued to trade in the whole of Ireland.Parts of Belfast and many of the towns and villages throughout Northern Ireland ended up with Northern Bank branches, sometimes beside each other!Rationalisation of branches took place over many years in areas such as AntrimBallyclareShankill Roadand Holywoodto name but a few.Branches would be merged into one site or even a brand-new site to create modern branch offices.During a financial crisis of its own the Midland Bank eventually sold the Northern Bank to the National Australia Bank, which later transferred ownership to Danske Bank.Thenote-issuing rights would again come into play. Once again, a Private Bill was considered to transfer the rights to Danske Bank but that was considered to be too expensive a plan.The decision was taken by the Directors’ to create a trading name of Danske Bank. Thus, the current bank is now known legally, and on their banknotes, as ‘Northern Bank Limited trading as Danske Bank’. Shortly after this, all the branches and offices were rebranded as Danske Bank.Many of the former Belfast Bank buildings have been sold on to other businesses. However, the name of ‘Belfast Bank’ continues to adorn a few of these old buildings, such as in Portrush, Rathfriland and Warrenpoint.Some other branches have been demolished and only photographs remain, for instance the Lisburn and Duncairn Gardens branches. And the name remains on a brass plaque, still displayed in the Royal Victoria Hospital. Marking their bank’s centenary in , staff raised £ to name a bed in perpetuity in the RVH - ‘The Belfast Bank Bed-’. In a main article headlined ‘A Notable Anniversary’ the Newsletter described the bank’s -year celebrations as “a note-worthy occasion in the history of an organisation whose fortunes have been largely bound up with the development of Belfast from a town of very moderate size to its present eminence as a great industrial port and one of the capitals of the British Empire.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Phil, who used to wear XL shirts and had a waistline of  inches, was recently ill with what was thought to be Covid-. He believes that while it was unpleasant and he was knocked off his feet, he’s not sure he would have survivedhe hadn’t lost weight. He said: “I dread to think how my body would have responded.

His main worry was that would he die in his sleep and his body couldn’t be removed from the third floor of his parents’ house.Phil, who has slimmed from st .lbs to st lbs in three years, said: “I was always bigger than my peers – I remember at school being called out by my PE teacher for being too big to play football. “The weight really started to pile on though when I started university. My size meant my le became increasingly insular and I made up a iety of excuses not to go out.“I’d avoid gatherings like parties and weddings because I just felt so uncomfortable. I knew I wouldn’t fit into a plane seat so I never travelled, even though I really wanted to. Apart from my job as a civil servant, I didn’t really do anything except hide away and eat. It was a very lonely time.”Phil Kayes with his partner Nicole MullhollandPhil realised he had to do something about his weight when his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer: “Mum was facing her fourth cancer battle which sadly turned out to be her last. The news sort of spurred me into action and I knew this time I had to try and be as healthy as I could – not just for her but for me as well. “I was also worried thatmy mum did pass away, I wouldn’t be able to be one of her pallbearers, which was heart-breaking. She died in October , by which point I’d lost five stones. I know she’d be really proudshe could see me now.”Since halving his bodyweight, Phil has become more active and has started cycling again after a near -year absence from the activity. He said the best thing to happen to him since shedding  stone is meeting his partner, Nicole Mullholland, on an online dating app. Since the temporary suspension of its , community groups, Slimming World has launched a virtual weight-loss service to continue to support members.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Meanwhile, the global crisis of climate change is accelerating.ldquoWe have a once-in-a-letime opportunity to address these urgent challenges together itrsquos there for the taking.He said a green recovery was the only way out of the ldquoterrible situation of Covid- and the economic crisis, that would create resilience, jobs and prosperity ndash but the ldquowindow of opportunity is closing already.ldquoWhat is now happening is a real opportunity to make a change which will be remembered forever as the great leap forward, which really could be done, but it is now, it isnrsquot tomorrow, he said.Key priorities for investment and action in the UK include:ndash Insulating homes to make them warmer and cheaper to heat, as well as measures to ensure they do not overheat as temperatures rise, for example by improving shading through trees and ensuring better ventilation.There is also a need to boost the use of clean heat pumps and to bring in proposed standards now for new buildings to be low carbon and water efficient.ndash Woodland planting and restoring peatland to store carbon and protect against future climate risks such as flooding, restoring parks and planting trees in cities and towns.ndash Making it easier for people to walk, cycle and work from home, with investment in safe spaces for walking and cycling, more bike parking and shared bike schemes, and prioritising investment in G and broadband over improving the road network.ndash Increasing recycling rates rapidly and banning food and garden waste from going to landfill within five years.The committeersquos report also called for training programmes, for example for builders and plumbers to install heat pumps.And the highly skilled North Sea oil and gas workforce could be retrained and redeployed in areas such as technology to capture and store carbon emissions from power plants and industrial processes.The Government is also urged to encourage the public to stick with positive behaviours such as walking and cycling, and to invest in science and innovation in technology to help tackle climate change.The report also calls for any bailouts of polluting industry to have ldquogreen strings attached and for taxes to be used to drive emissions reductions ndash for example increases on fuel duty ndash with the potential for carbon taxes able to raise pound billion a year over the next decade.A Government spokesman said: ldquoWe agree with the committee that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. He said the UK was investing to deliver more offshore wind than any other country and to reduce emissions from homes and industry.And he said: ldquoWe believe that the actions we need to take to achieve our zero emissions target can help to deliver a stronger, cleaner, more sustainable and more resilient economy after this pandemic ndash and already there are over , UK jobs in low-carbon businesses and their supply chains..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uOnce-in-a-letime opportunity u to speed up climate action with green recovery article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Importantly, it would also raise much needed funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland’s Childhood Day.The service centre where Michelle works, is based at Carn Drive in Craigavon and delivers NSPCC’s Letting The Future In and Turn the Page services.Letting the Future In focuses on helping children and young people recover from the traumatic and negative effects of sexual abuse and to rebuild their lives, while Turn the Page helps children and young people overcome the experiences and feelings that have led tothem displaying harmful sexual behaviour towards others. Covid- has caused huge dficulties for the team in Craigavon because it is vital to maintain contact and the all-important relationship between the treatment workers and the young people but face-to-face contact wasn’t possible because of the lockdown. The centre has adapted to the situation by keeping in touch with appropriate apps and video calls which offer young people an opportunity to access support in their own environment but still maintain relationships with their workers.Michelle also has her own personal reasons for wanting to raise funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland.She said: “As a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I realise that the lockdown is a particularly dficult time because it can trigger traumas from the past such as the feelings of powerlessness, fear of threat to le and being ‘held captive’ by the virus through isolation and reduced connection to other people.“It can be hard to get motivated during such strange times so I decided to do something positive that would improve my overall emotional wellbeing whilst also raising money for NSPCC Northern Ireland and creating awareness of some of the work we do.“As a child I benefited from support from The NSPCC at a time when no one  believed in me and this has given me a real passion for the work I do now. It is so important that children who have been affected by child sexual abuse get all the help and support they need to help them recover and I can see that the staff at NSPCC still carry the same belief that children can and do survive the trauma of sexual abuse.”Michelle’s event has been a huge success.She said: “I have to admit, it has been tougher than I thought initially. As someone who hates running and has done very little, I think I underestimated it! However I have noticed a big improvement in my emotional wellbeing and sleep since beginning the challenge. I have definitely felt motivated by the support and all the generous donations and this has really spurred me on.“Above all, I just wanted to give something back to NSPCC as I believe I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support in the past. I also wanted to raise awareness about the taboo in our society surrounding sexual abuse and topromote our belief that children can and do recover with the right support.“Joanne McMaster, Supporter Fundraising Manager for Northern Ireland, added: “We are hugely grateful to Michelle for undertaking this wonderful fundraising initiative for NSPCC’s Childhood Day. “This is NSPCC Northern Ireland’s third Childhood Day and is taking place on June  and in the run up to the day, we are asking peopleto stand with us and support our work - there are lots of fun and simple ways toget involved. “This year, Childhood Day is encouraging the peopleto ‘Be a big kid’ and raise money to help us be here for children. This could include organising a childhood themed quiz night, getting sponsored to dress up for the day or holding a mini sports day in your back garden but in all cases, remembering to follow the latest social distancing rules. There are lots more ideas on how to get involved and suggestions for fun events on our website www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday“Funds raised by the day could not come at a better time because we are growing increasingly concerned about the number of children who will experience abuse or neglect due to the impact of coronavirus, with families struggling with lockdown, job losses and school closures. By supporting Childhood Day you are raising awareness and crucial funds to enable us to keep children and young people safe.”If you would like to contribute to Michelle’s fundraising, go to www.justgiving fundraising Michelle-Duffy For further information on how you can get support NSPCC’s Childhood Day, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or contact the NSPCC Northern Ireland Team at northernirelandappeals@nspcc.org.uk or   .--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcfbedfbebaedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cffdbcbfbbff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
