Bathers looking upwards collided with each other in the water, boatmen stopped rowing and taxi drivers stopped their engines.In Southend, the whole eight miles of seafront were crowded with thousands of visitors, and all eyes were turned skyward to see the wonderful writing.\u0027The impression it left was one of amazement, for nothing could be seen in the sky but the letters traced in smoke,\u0027 said one onlooker. \u0027The most successful free exhibition,\u0027 cried another.Captain Turner was poised to become the first pilot to bring commercial messages to the skies. Days later, he produced his first official airborne advertisement — two words in vast, silvery letters in the blue skies above the thousands of ecstatic race-goers at the Epsom Derby: \u0027Daily Mail!\u0027         The art originated in the skies above the Western Front when British airmen used paraffin oil to create smoke trails. (Stock image)          The \u0027ink\u0027 used in skywriting is a mixture of light paraffin oil and water which, when pumped into the plane\u0027s exhaust, heats up and turns into a smoky vapour. (Stock image)There has always been something magical about skywriting — words created in the sky by agile and talented pilots who, somehow, while flying at high speeds, mirror-write messages in the sky.Letters that hang, swirling and shimmering in the breeze, before vanishing into thin air.So what a perk, at an otherwise grim time to learn that, after a six-decade ban, skywriting is now set to make an unexpected return to British skies.Even better, it could help our increasingly beleaguered aviation and advertising industries.Proposals have been published by the Department for Transport (DfT) to amend aviation regulations to reintroduce it for advertising purposes, state events, airshows, birthday celebrations and marriage proposals.The result could generate about £4 million a year in revenue but, more importantly, Britain would finally be back in step with much of the world for a skill we invented.It would also allow our pilots —some of the best skywriters in the world — to work here, not America, China and Australia. (Just last week, one skywriter wrote \u0027WASH HANDS\u0027 in 600-metre letters high in the Sydney sky.)Skywriting originated in the skies above the Western Front where British airmen used paraffin oil to create smoke trails, which they used to signal to the troops below.         There are environmental worries over skywriting which include increased CO2 emissions and the risk of abusive or inappropriate messages. (Stock image)But it was our very own RAF airmen, Captain Turner and Major Jack Savage who, in the post-war years, turned it into a lucrative commercial enterprise. After all that inaugural Daily Mail excitement, they took the business to New York where Turner scrawled a huge \u0027Hello USA\u0027 in the skies above the city and sparked an entire industry.The next day, he wrote \u0027CALL VANDERBILT 7200,\u0027 the telephone number of the hotel where he was staying. Legend has it that, over the following two-and-half hours, the hotel\u0027s operators fielded 47,000 phone calls.Within 10 years, skywriting was the biggest thing in advertising, far cheaper than radio and used to sell everything from cigarettes to Pepsi, and send love messages from wealthy suitors.Soon, the mere sound of a low-flying aeroplane would see city-dwellers rush to the window to see what message it carried.By 1940, it was one of Pepsi-Cola\u0027s major advertising methods — that year alone, the company commissioned 2,225 flights. The same year, during the Roosevelt-Willkie presidential race, New Yorkers were messaged, \u0027no third term\u0027.During World War II, the Germans even used skywriting to spell out surrender appeals above Soviet and, later, Yugoslav troops.In 1969, during the Vietnam War, Yoko Ono and John Lennon commissioned a skywriter to create a message over New York City: \u0027War is over if you want it — happy Christmas from John and Yoko.\u0027But while it thrived elsewhere, skywriting has been banned by our government since 1960.In part, for health and safety reasons, but more as a pre-emptive response to the possibility it could have been used to spread communist propaganda at the height of the Cold War.Happily, neither concern still applies, and thanks to lobbying by transport minister Grant Shapps (himself a pilot), an end to our antiquated ban looks in sight.We just need a few incredibly talented pilots who also happen to be decent spellers.Nearly a century after Captain Turner was looping and banking, the skill needed is still extraordinary, and the process is similar. The \u0027ink\u0027 is a mixture of light paraffin oil and water which, when pumped into the plane\u0027s exhaust, heats up and turns into a smoky vapour, hanging in the air between 7,000 and 14,000 feet up. Skytyping — where planes flying abreast puff smoke at intervals to form letters — is different. And neither should be confused with banners, which are trailed behind light aircraft.Naturally, leaving a message, however temporary, in the sky is very expensive. Compared to the £500 or so it costs to hire a plane to pull a banner, it costs thousands for letters that last barely four minutes, if you\u0027re lucky.(Though they won\u0027t get tangled in your propeller and nearly kill you, as happened to poor old Nigel Farage when his UKIP banner brought his plane down on the day of the 2010 General Election.)Success — crispness and legibility of letter and duration of display — is subject to the vagaries of the British weather. Optimum conditions are calm, blue skies. Too much wind and all those carefully flown letters blow away.There are also environmental worries, which include increased CO2 emissions, safety concerns and the risk of abusive or inappropriate messages. After all, once a message is 2.5 miles up in the sky, it is there for all to see.Indeed, while plenty of romantics have proposed or declared their love with heart-warming messages, not everyone has embraced skywriting\u0027s celebratory side.When his wife ran off with someone else, millionaire John Everson paid a pilot to skywrite \u0027Cindy Everson is a sex cheat\u0027 in the blue skies above Houston, Texas.In a similar vein, Dirk Delahune, of Chicago, paid for \u0027Marla Delahune is a tramp\u0027 to be trailed across the skies after he caught her in bed with her tennis coach.Which, as well as humiliating poor Marla, must have been rather eye-catching for everyone looking up in Chicago that day.But the DfT seems to have all that covered.\u0027Offensive or otherwise illegal content could be subject to general criminal law,\u0027 it writes in its online consultation document.Even better, the environmental concerns are negligible. Partly because smoke used to create the messages is a refined, non-toxic, and inherently bio-degradable white mineral oil, but also because the planes used have minimal impact on the environment.So hurrah! Finally, some good news that would surely have sent the late Captain Cyril Turner looping the loop, and will hopefully cheer the rest of us up a bit, too.Even if, for the foreseeable future, rather than \u0027Karen, I love you\u0027 and \u0027Bobby, will you marry me?\u0027 our messages are more likely to say: \u0027Wash your hands!\u0027 and \u0027Has anyone got any loo roll?\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Governments use social media enforce coronavirus lockdowns","story":"Share this article He said the research had been provided to the Italian government.He added: \u0027In our view, privacy is very important.

Police in the hardest-hit Lombardy region are now using drones to make sure people adhere to strict rules meaning people cannot go outside except for emergenciesWhile the country employed some tactics that are being used the world over - including mass testing at drive-through sites - it has so-far avoided mass lockdowns of the kind used in China and western countries.Seoul did this by aggressively \u0027contact tracing\u0027 people who had encountered infected people, allowing them to build up a much more detailed picture of how the virus was spreading and who might have it.Health officials retraced patients’ movements using security camera footage, credit card records, and GPS data from their cars and cellphones.Messages would then be sent out to the phone of anyone who might have come into contact with that person urging them to get tested.Websites and smartphone apps are used to alert people to where patients have been hour-by-hour, allowing them to identify if they might have been infected. And those forced into self-quarantine are forced to download an app that monitors whether they are breaching self-isolation guidelines with fines up to $2,500 for non-compliance, the New York Times reports.While China made liberal use of lockdowns now being seen in the West - at one point restricting the movement of an estimated 760million people - it also used phone and social media data to track potential cases.

The open car door invites a story. It’s like a frame from a movie’This is the photograph that threw me right in at the deep end. It was December 2015 and I was working in the video games industry as an art director. I had a graphic design background and so I definitely had an artistic eye and could compose an image – but all I knew about the camera was how to press the shutter button.I was based in Canada but was on holiday in Tokyo. I was walking back to my hotel one night in the rain when I came across this taxi driver – he was waiting for a couple to leave a love hotel. The passenger door was open, causing the interior to light up. A lot of luck was involved. I had saved up for and bought a new camera, but at the time I didn’t really know how to use it. I took several pictures of this same scene and they were mostly blurry, but this shot came into focus.If it looks composed that’s because I was thinking of all the movies and cinematography that I love: Wong Kar-wai’s In the Mood for Love or Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive. It was all just there in front of me. Before this moment, I was just a visitor in the city taking photographs at regular tourist spots.I didn’t have any social media presence back then, but I would occasionally share pictures on my personal Facebook page. I put this image online and it created a real buzz with my friends, who encouraged me to take more in the same style. As a result, I spent each night of my holiday capturing the streets of Tokyo after midnight. When Adobe and the Saatchi Gallery shared it things went wild. It was quite intimidating. I didn’t consider myself a photographer, and yet suddenly my work was being viewed by thousands of people and in great detail. I found it challenging. I hadn’t even heard of the phrase “pixel peep” – when other photographers look closely into every single detail of an image and find its flaws. But it made me want to practise more to master the technical side of photography rather than just relying on the camera’s automatic settings.I specialise in night photography now, so I’m often walking around looking for a strong light source. Low-light photography has its own set of challenges, which I love. I probably wouldn’t have noticed the taxi driver if he hadn’t been lit up by the open car door. I know the door invites a story, but I’m not a storyteller. I’m actually really bad at writing. When it comes to photography, for me it’s really about capturing moments. I’ve never had to inject a narrative into my photography work, I much prefer to leave it open to interpretation. A lot of people tell me my work reminds them of Blade Runner. Every still in that movie is like a painting. Roger Deakins, who worked on Blade Runner 2049, is one of my main inspirations – he’s brilliant at using strong silhouettes and restricted colour palettes. I try to combine the kind of treatment you see in films with the composition techniques of old black-and-white photographers. My absolute favourite is Fan Ho and his 1950s images of Hong Kong. But I never went down the route of that style of photography. It was more about seeing movies and trying to figure out how I could apply those techniques to street photography and combine it with my expertise developing styles as an art director for video games.It was in Tokyo during that trip that I discovered another key influence. I’d been to the Imperial Palace and stumbled upon the old book district, Jinbōchō. I found an old copy of the late Syd Mead’s art book: Kronolog – a rare discovery in perfect condition with the LaserDisc still in its wrapper. Mead had worked on the original Blade Runner and it was his work that inspired my photography. I think people found the image compelling because it felt like a frame from a movie. I wouldn’t say it’s a perfect image, but it means a lot to me and was the beginning of my series TO:KY:OO – capturing the beauty of Tokyo at night. The photograph kickstarted my photography career, which in turn connected me with people and opportunities that would not have been possible had I never pressed the shutter button. • Liam Wong’s book TO:KY:OO is published by Thames \u0026amp Hudson.Training: Art degree from Abertay University, Dundee.High point: “Connecting with people through photography.”Low point: “Lacking the confidence to pursue art as a career.”Top tip: “Find your voice – seek all of the things that inspire you and create something wild.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96a77489599d585e5439a4bdc16479de3938e90/0_547_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b515f779cd17fdf29dfdb2c3376dd1","title":"south korea booming drive ins in pictures","story":"Box office numbers for drive-in cinemas in Seoul, South Korea, are on the rise as people find a way to avoid crowds during the coronavirus outbreak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbaccea5a9931318eca764501bad029a635a62e7/0_130_7073_4247/master/7073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34bdf795646aee4822387acca6876f1c","title":"as if by chance david lan review","story":"From guerrilla warfare in Zimbabwe to drama at the Young Vic, the playwright and stage director captures a varied life well livedAlways, on entering the endlessly reconfigured auditoria of the Young Vic theatre, on London’s South Bank, the shiver of excitement at not knowing where the stage and the seats are going to be. Or perhaps there won’t be a stage at all, but an arena of mud (Shakespeare) a conference room (Ibsen) beanbags laid under the starry heavens (Brecht) plywood pews either side of a conveyer belt (Kafka) a mound of rubble with a woman buried to her neck (guess who). Most shocking of all, perhaps, are the productions in which the audience sits in rows, with the stage behind a proscenium arch. The Young Vic is a theatre that turns things topsy-turvy. The conventional is made shocking. Classics seem like new plays new plays are treated as classics.Its success is down, at least in part, to David Lan, who served as artistic director from 2000 to 2018, overseeing a major refurbishment and luring talent and audiences of all kinds to the small building, formerly a butcher’s shop and a bombsite. He has travelled the world and brought its greatest directors and ensembles back to this country, from Iceland, Africa, Australia, as others would bring back duty-free cigarettes. As a young man he witnessed that happy and forgotten time when Peter Daubeny’s world theatre season ran annually at the Aldwych, and when the National Theatre thought itself duty bound to host great foreign companies led by directors such as Peter Stein, Roger Planchon and Patrice Chéreau. Chéreau worked at the National in 1974, but did not return to this country until 2011 – at Lan’s invitation. The Young Vic became one of the few theatres in Britain to have a global perspective.In 2015 it was widely reported that Lan had unsuccessfully applied to become co-director of the National, with Stephen Daldry. As If by Chance makes no mention of this, but is firm proof, were it needed, that the theatre’s board made a grave mistake. Lan’s writing glows with his humanity and skill, with his literal worldliness, as he patches together into one narrative all the many lives he has led.Born in South Africa in 1952 to a family of eastern European Jews, he has been a student of JM Coetzee at the University of Cape Town, where he was caught up in anti-apartheid protests. He has worked at the Royal Court theatre, in a world of seedy 70s glamour, a life of freezing bedsits and Aldermaston marches. He has been a librettist for two operas, and the writer of some 20 plays and TV scripts. He has translated Chekhov. He has been playwright Nicholas Wright’s partner for over half-a-century. He has been conscripted into, and escaped from, the South African army. He has conducted two years of field research in northern Zimbabwe, and his study of the interrelation of guerrilla warfare with the local mediums possessed by the spirit of dead ancestors, Guns and Rain (1985), is still a classic anthropological text.Lan constructs his memoir from short scenes that flick between these numerous existences, arranged in delightful disorder and written with the playwright’s flair for dialogue. Memories are not narrated so much as displayed through reconstructed conversation, as if Ivy Compton-Burnett had written a memoir: everything is shown, nothing is told. Lan’s ear for different modes of speech is brilliant, from his Jewish grandmother’s “beetroot voice” to his assistant in Zimbabwe, who starts every story with “long back ago”. He conjures portraits of directors from Luc Bondy to Ivo van Hove, of writers such as Caryl Churchill and David Mamet. He watches, as a child and as an adult, his parents’ marriage and health unravel he crawls with his tape recorder near the flames and the drummers as a long-dead ancestor takes possession of a Zimbabwean spirit medium.To read the book is to swim in someone else’s memory, unsure what is real, and what has been damaged or retinted by the passage of time, and by the memoirist’s ability to dramatise. Lan writes in that risky tense, the historical present, but readers who think themselves allergic to it should take some form of literary antihistamine and jump in. The book’s disarray of scenes and tenses, its slippery use of time, has a purpose. Lan is linking memory with theatre, and theatre with life. The narrative is constantly reconfiguring itself, like the auditorium of the Young Vic. He intercuts a drama on stage with a drama in his life, using dozens of quick-fire scene changes. Madame Ranevskaya, as she mourns her drowned son in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard, is spliced with his own mother, grieving his brother’s death from polio. Disconcertingly, he never employs a trio of asterisks – a literary black-out – to indicate the break between fiction and memory. Threads of recollection, truth and trickery are tightly interwoven through the book, linking the uncertainties of remembrance past with the uncertainties of theatre: the illusion of a reality that can seem more real than real life.He is “Dovidol” to his Jewish grandmother “Dave” to his mother “Master Davey” to the gardener in his childhood home “Gunner 68351048” to an angry sergeant “dear David” to Peter Brook. But in the end, Lan’s many lives are entwined, to reveal them, all along, to have been one life, well lived. The dramatis personae are colleagues, friends, lovers, mentors, mentees they are subjected to his scrutiny as he tries to unravel the complexities of societies and relationships, on stage and on paper, sparing nobody, least of all himself. The distance between the playwright, the director, and the social anthropologist is not that far, after all.• As If by Chance is published by Faber (RRP £16).

But he did not mean the confinement of quarantine. Rather, he meant the social isolation of every person in a country already worshipping what he called the “Mammon Gospel”.The word was still new in English: even the verb “isolate” is unrecorded before the 19th century. It comes from the Latin insulare, literally meaning “to make into an island”. Indeed, the cliched formula “splendid isolation” derives from someone talking about an island nation: in 1896, the Canadian prime minister described Britain as “splendidly isolated … this isolation of England comes from her superiority”.Isolation could once indeed be regarded as a luxury for the rich and powerful: not long ago, one could hear reports of celebrity wellness regimes involving “isolation tanks”, which Carlyle would have regarded as a symptom of the deeper spiritual isolation of modern society. For him, Victorian capitalism encouraged “not a mutual helpfulness but rather … a mutual hostility”.

But his streak of unparalleled perfection came in the Reagan era: City Primeval (1980), Split Images (1981), Cat Chaser (1982), Stick (1983), LaBrava (1983), Glitz (1985), Bandits (1987), Freaky Deaky (1988), Killshot (1989), and the Everest at the end of it all, Get Shorty (1990).I find it intriguing that Leonard followed one of his few humourless novels with one of his funniest and breeziest, but Killshot – tense and unforgiving – was quite possibly a metaphorical exorcism of the rage he felt toward an implacable entity (Hollywood) that had so relentlessly abused his literary offspring. (At the time he wrote Get Shorty, nine of Leonard’s novels had been adapted for film, and those adaptations, save for two westerns, ran the gamut from pedestrian to abysmal.) But Get Shorty, his gimlet-eyed look at the movie business, is a remarkable example of tonal command, somehow managing to mercilessly skewer Hollywood while simultaneously blowing it a kiss. It has the bite of The Day of the Locust but none of the bile.A murder, a plane crash, a random mugging that wasn’t actually random, a heist that implodes, a child gone missing – these are staple inciting incidents of a lot of crime fiction. The event that clearly lights the match that leads to a race against time to stop the conspiracy, solve the homicide, get out of town before the net closes in, or find the child.Here’s how Get Shorty starts: the mobster Ray “Bones” Barboni “borrows” the leather jacket of a loan shark (and diehard movie geek) named Ernesto “Chili” Palmer. Chili retrieves the jacket by punching Ray in the face which leads, a dozen years later, to (stay with me) Chili investigating the faked death of a Miami dry cleaner, which brings Chili to Las Vegas not long before he shows up in the study of a B-movie Hollywood actress named Karen Flores to threaten a deadbeat producer, Harry Zimm, who leads him into the movie business, where he attempts to leave loan-sharking behind and become a producer – along with Harry and Karen – of the film Mr Lovejoy.That, my friends, is an Elmore Leonard beginning. Where other novels zig, Leonard’s zag. Plot is not a series of bricks built upon bricks to erect a formidable edifice, but a loose collection of steps one or two primary characters take down a path that crosses another path that leads to a building with a room where more people are gathered. When one of those characters goes out the back door and down a fire escape, the original character follows and enters an alley which leads to another path which winds further away from that first path, which nobody remembers anyway because it’s, like, 10 paths back. In other words, Elmore Leonard’s plots feel less like plots and more like life.Over the course of just under 300 pages, Get Shorty treats us to a potentially lethal limousine-service-operator-cum-drug-dealer-cum-budding-film producer, his henchman, the henchman’s three-year-old daughter, a hapless Colombian gangster-wannabe stuck at LAX watching a locker that may or may not be staked out by half a dozen DEA agents, a blithely narcissistic movie star, several Miami-based gangsters, and the zippiest (and most meta) satire of Hollywood ever written. How meta? It’s precog meta. Discussing the possible casting for the movie they hope to make, Harry Zimm tells Chili:0 “If I could get Gene Hackman, say, we’d be in preproduction as I speak.” Five years after the book’s publication, the part of Harry Zimm would be played in the movie by none other than … Gene Hackman.Get Shorty gets so much right about Hollywood: the endless jockeying for status that afflicts everyone from studio heads to parking valets the heartless consequences of aging in a town that adulates youth the feeling that everyone has a script in their head, ready to pitch. (Not long after I moved out here, I ran into a nun who, seconds after she found out what I did for a living, pitched me her movie idea.) But Get Shorty gets nothing as right as it does the childlike love most of the people in the movie business have for movies themselves. You can’t successfully satirise something unless some part of you loves what you’re satirising, and Leonard retained his love of movies. Most of his books are peppered with references to cinema, as the characters try to find the line where their movie-influenced personas meet their true selves. But if the persona has been in play long enough, who’s to say the person is more real? In Leonard’s view, maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe we are all creatures of ceaseless reinvention. It’s not only an acceptable way of comporting oneself, it might be our cultural birthright. To be born in a celluloid age is to be born with one’s myths arrayed all around one, as easy to touch as one’s own skin (which the myths often become). Chili Palmer, the loan shark on a journey to reinvent himself as a film producer, is as much an Everyman for today’s world as Walter Mitty was for his.When I was in my teens, I took subways all over Boston to search out Leonard’s novels in used bookstores. This was before he became popular, so finding one of his novels was no easy thing. But I was already voice-obsessed by that age and Leonard had a voice like no other. That voice was the outgrowth of the most finely tuned ear for urban speech that American letters has produced. No one ever wrote American dialogue as well as Leonard. And that dialogue wasn’t just pitch-perfect and often hilarious and profane (although it was all those things), it also advanced the story and gave you a full glimpse into the interior lives of characters who lived several zip codes away from anything resembling introspection.As an adult, I hung out with him twice, once in a bar in the midwest (a recovering alcoholic, he drank O’Doul’s with gusto), and the other time at a literary festival in a small town in Italy. Both times I was struck by what a dude he was. Cooler than almost anyone I’ve ever met. As cool as Chili Palmer, Raylan Givens, Ernest Stickley Jr or Vincent Mora – to name just a few of the laconic badasses who took centre stage at one time or another in his novels. The books were like the man – wry and observant, contemptuous of navel-gazing. And yet, underneath all that cool was a moral vision all the more powerful for its refusal to overwhelm the narrative. You want to know what the sociopolitical climate of the US was in the 1980s and 1990s? Read any Leonard novel published back then. Want to know how Detroit went bankrupt in 2013? Read Elmore Leonard in 1983. He didn’t beat the reader over the head with these observations – you’d barely notice them amid all the wordplay and gunplay and some of the sleaziest, funniest, and most terrifying villains in fiction – but the commentary’s there if you look for it.So why did Hollywood continually screw up adaptations of his work? Maybe because Hollywood understands plot a lot better than it understands story. Story is about things that happen, yes, but it’s also about character and tone and mood. It’s as much about the wandering as it is about the arrival. And all who wander, as the saying goes, are not lost. But studio executives don’t like wandering. Wandering freaks them out. Wandering smells like film and studio executives hate film they barely like movies. (They are huge fans of product, though. Huge.) You can’t enjoy Elmore Leonard unless you enjoy wandering. And if you don’t know the difference between plot and story, you’re probably not going to get what he was doing either.At his peak, Leonard told better stories than anyone. And those stories were always evangelically focused on character – crazy characters, greedy ones, often sociopathic (even the “hero” cops), sometimes staggeringly stupid or deceptively smart, but resolutely alive. He placed them on the page with a kind of pitiless joy he never sentimentalised them, but that didn’t make him (or us) love them any less. He was the least moralistic moral writer of our time. When the movies tried to transpose the plot to the screen without giving the characters their full due, they failed. But when they revelled in those characters – in the TV show Justified, in Get Shorty, Jackie Brown or Out of Sight (far and away the greatest Leonard film adaptation) – they unlocked the secret to the man’s work. All Leonard asked of plot was that it be a serviceable vehicle, but the journey and the people who took it, that was everything.Oh, and those characters? They’d talk on that journey. A lot. Often the talk was the journey. It’s revelatory to reread Leonard and realise how much story is propelled by people talking. After its Miami opening, which covers 12 years in two pages, Get Shorty has exactly four locations in the first 100 pages – Karen’s house, Harry’s car, Harry’s wonderfully low-rent “production” office, and Karen’s car. Yet, through the conversations that occur in those four locations, we traverse back and forth in time and range all across the country.Throughout Get Shorty, Leonard plays a very cheeky (and, again, a very meta) game. He makes the story you’re reading a story about making up stories as one goes along. This is what writers do — we make it up as we go. Some of us are more organised than others, some less so, but that’s the crux of the job description. At the end of the first chapter, Chili inadvertently stumbles upon the fact that a dry cleaner has faked his own death. The dry cleaner’s wife tells Chili (but not the reader) “everything that happened”. And then Leonard delivers the kicker: “It was a good story.”Leonard, the grandmaster of storytelling, is winking at us. He’s pitching us. Like a Hollywood pro. Settle in. The fun’s about to begin. Chili will ultimately end up in Hollywood, pitching Harry Zimm the story of the dry cleaner, which is a story the author himself invented. So Chili is, in essence, pitching an Elmore Leonard story within an Elmore Leonard novel to an Elmore Leonard character (who will ultimately be played by Gene Hackman). This riffing on story, on how it’s created in all its fits and starts and wandering, forms the essence of the novel. Even the ostensible bad guy, the drug dealer Bo Catlett, aspires to make movies and has a terrific sense of story (better than either Chili or Harry Zimm, in point of fact). A scene in which Bo and Chili threaten one another on one hand, while, on the other, they debate the finer points of authenticity and character-as-action in the Mr Lovejoy script they both want to lay their hands on is a pitch-perfect distillation of creative collaboration.In the end, Get Shorty (a title that is never explained, though “Shorty” has long been rumoured to refer to Dustin Hoffman who supposedly flirted, ad infinitum, with playing the lead in an adaptation of LaBrava) is a celebration of the impulse to tell stories and the corresponding need to hear them. It’s an elegy to all addictive consumers of celluloid myth. And maybe it’s Elmore Leonard’s love letter, at the close of a deliriously productive creative decade, to writing itself.Then again, maybe not. Leonard was notoriously unpretentious about his chosen profession. As Harry tells Chili while they drive along Sunset Boulevard looking at the homes of far more famous people, there’s only one type of writing guaranteed to make you a lot of money: ransom notes.• The Folio Society edition of Elmore Leonard’s Get Shorty, illustrated by Gary Kelley, is available at foliosociety.

The break gives fans a chance to reassessSport is gone, at least for the time being. The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic has taken it from our screens, courts and stadiums – the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics until 2021 is the inevitable final part of a wave obliterating elite sport and beyond. The evenings, afternoons and weekends when we would be obsessively watching professional athletes are suddenly free. As a result, given this sudden and stunning loss, many of us are bereft.Or are we? Perhaps it’s too early to tell. We may certainly miss watching our favourite spectacle, but we may not miss everything else that comes with it – most notably, what often feels like contempt for the paying consumer, and in particular those who go and watch their favourite teams and athletes, often at huge expense. We are in extraordinary times. Not since the second world war has professional sport come to a global halt and, with each passing week, its audiences will increasingly assess what role this entertainment usefully plays in their lives.The smarter people at the helm of major sport will be worried about this. After all, the last huge institution to take the adulation of the masses for granted was the Catholic church and, despite still pulling in impressive attendances, it is not hard today to notice the large number of vast chapels with empty pews in many countries. The next few months will be vital to reflect on the position of sport in public life.At present, those running sport have an important factor in their favour: as country after country begins to endure a partial or total lockdown of non-essential services, the withdrawal symptoms will be severe. For the time being, many people will crave the escapism that sport offers, and the nostalgia will be out in full force: desperate for drama, we will revisit classic matches as fondly as if they were our favourite television series. Whenever live sport returns, many of us will meet it with more joy than ever.Yet many dedicated sports fans may demand something better. Coronavirus has provided a moment of self-reflection for sport as bracing as that which the 2008 financial crash provided for the economy. Just as that crisis gave rise to the Occupy movement and its accompanying list of demands for a fairer society, we must ask what demands there might now be for a fairer fandom.Taking football as an example, some of the clubs are aware of this need to strengthen or rekindle their bonds with the surrounding community. We can view Manchester United and Manchester City’s joint gift of £100,000 to local food banks in this context. We can also note that this sum, while a generous amount, is less than the weekly wage of many of their top players. Elsewhere, some of the game’s prominent players – Leon Goretzka, Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski and his wife Anna – have given more than €2,000,000 to address the challenges posed by coronavirus. Several of Germany’s football fan “ultra” groups, meanwhile, have responded to the current crisis by calling for wage rises, helping at-risk groups, fundraising for Italian hospitals and contributing to blood donation drives.If football, and sport more generally, is to retain its place in the good graces of the public after what will be a traumatic time for many, then its institutions should be even more benevolent than inidual athletes or fans. And it should reconsider the wider relationship with fans in the coming months and years. In future, what can be done to maintain bonds with devoted fans and communities – and not just its wealthiest customers?No matter how happy people will be to see sport coming back, they will have navigated several hard financial realities without it, and spent what little cash they had to spare elsewhere. A society where so many are already living just a couple of pay cheques away from homelessness will have sustained yet another blow. How will it look if sport, oblivious to this suffering, continues to charge exorbitant fees for access to its events? How will it survive if it refuses to distribute its resources more fairly towards its foundations?The greatest danger to sport is that, in its absence, many of these people will have found other ways to fill and enjoy their afternoons and evenings. I was speaking recently with a passionate football fan and regular match-goer, and asked how he was feeling about his team’s chances of avoiding relegation if the season resumed. To my surprise, he answered that he didn’t really care – coronavirus had made him reassess his priorities. And that is bad news for sport, because its huge profits partly rely upon obsession, on people not having a sense of perspective. For sport to survive, it must continue to matter.In the months to come, professional sport must therefore show us – or prove to us anew – that it is more than a distraction that its senior figures care profoundly about matters beyond the pitch, the stadium and the balance sheet. We have seen some of that with the postponement and cancellation of international and club football and the Olympics, among many other events: acts of responsible leadership that eventually placed public health ahead of self-enrichment.With a mass pause imposed on us all, it is time for sport to rethink its social contract with those who adore it it is an opportunity to reassure those worshippers who may have become disillusioned that they can one day renew their faith.• Musa Okwonga is a poet, journalist and musician, and co-hosts the Stadio football podcast"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b8da8c3000f9bde0ac7cc99eaf628e2c8133e4f/0_278_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11dfd065cf7cda0bc6cb9eb131f1a5f0","title":"britain covid 19 predictions","story":"Beware confident predictions of our future after the Covid-19 crisis. Our response to seismic change is often to entrench existing views If there is one thing everyone living through the Covid-19 emergency agrees, it is that it is unprecedented. Everyone is surely right about that. But what follows in politics, economics and social behaviour from that recognition? There is no agreement there. There are resemblances with wartime, of course, but Britain never went into almost total lockdown in wartime. There are echoes of past pestilences too, but these afflictions did not bring normal life to such a totalising standstill.And these are only early days in a long process. Politicians are no better than anyone else at adjusting to radical change. As Boris Johnson’s uncertain initial messaging exemplified, adjustment takes time. The worst of the crisis is also yet to come. Covid-19 cases and deaths have not yet peaked. The outbreak may drag on for longer than we have yet grasped, or it may return. Pretending that life could be back to normal by Easter, as Donald Trump does, is delinquent. If the 1918-19 flu pandemic is a guide, the Covid-19 virus may be with us for a year.This length and seriousness mean that none of us yet knows what the final accounting on the Covid-19 crisis will look like. But we can say that we are likely to be living with some of the pandemic’s consequences for years to come. The issues that could endure are many. They start with the shared experience of having the shadow of death hanging over our heads. They include, additionally, the impact of the massive public health emergency itself, the many transformations of everyday living, the state’s mobilisation to defend the economy, and the general anxiety about the future that is laid bare in an Ipsos-Mori survey this week. None of these is likely to be gone by Christmas, never mind by Easter. Faced with an extraordinary event, it is natural to think it will have extraordinary long-term consequences too. Nevertheless, much of the speculation about this is struggling to adjust. Its feet are still firmly planted in the past. It is largely conditioned by earlier political isions such as Brexit. In some cases, the pandemic is merely vindicating whatever the thinker believed in the first place, before the outbreak began. All the pandemic has done is make them believe it more strongly than ever.There are three obvious problems with such an approach. The first is it assumes the pandemic will cause the scales to fall from the eyes of those who do not share it. But this may not happen. The second is that it fails to take account of how the public mood will change once the pandemic ceases. And it will. The third is that it avoids self-questioning.Both left and right are currently guilty of acting as though nothing has really changed. Those on the left who believed before Covid-19 that Britain was collapsing under the weight of social inequality, a lack of Keynesian demand management or the folly of Brexit have looked at the crisis and concluded that, yes, the pandemic proves that they were right all along. Yet those on the right who believed beforehand that the economy was more reliably run in their hands, that borders needed to be rather more tightly controlled, and that nation states must make their own decisions feel equally vindicated.In the same way, when it comes to attitudes towards inidual politicians, Johnson’s admirers now admire him even more than ever, while his detractors denounce him even more indignantly. It seems obvious to his critics that Johnson is the wrong man for the crisis and equally obvious to them that he is mishandling it so badly he may be overthrown. But the opinion polls don’t say that. A lot of people elected Johnson in December and even more think he is doing a good job now. Everyone in these debates could use a bit of humility and a dose of open-mindedness. That’s true on both sides. It’s true for all of us. The right has been forced to relearn the prime importance of the state as guarantor in a period of emergency. It is having to accept the state’s irreducible responsibility to the most vulnerable. It has also, perhaps, learned that what a health service can achieve reflects the investment that has been made in it, although no health service anywhere has been or could have been fully prepared.But the left has lessons to learn too. Many of the takeaways from the Covid-19 crisis may seem obvious. But what is true during a crisis is not necessarily true or desirable when the crisis is over. The NHS needs whatever it takes in a crisis, but at other times health service spending is as long as a piece of string and there has to be a cut-off point, if only to allow spending elsewhere. The borrowing that may or may not save the economy from recession in a crisis will also have to be paid for when the crisis is over. People may trust Johnson with powers they would not want Jeremy Corbyn to possess.We are sailing in the dark towards an unknown future. Britain’s mood after the first world war and the flu pandemic has been described by the historian Richard Overy as “the morbid age”. It was, Overy says, an era of fear and paranoia about a dystopian future. Few put their faith in traditional politics. Britain after the second was very different. “Never again” was its more optimistic motto. No one can say which of these moods, or what other mood, is likely after the Covid-19 pandemic . Instead of insisting that the pandemic confirms everything we thought beforehand, it would be better to start thinking about all the unwelcome changes that the pandemic may bring in the decade to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad137e6cf6c017dd811e0288c3b11e93f5afe737/0_55_5084_3051/master/5084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53dbf01506e99f031602dd8a559baee0","title":"they can lock me down but they cant make me read proust","story":"Dress up to work from home, take up calligraphy, learn Mandarin … enough of this chin-up cheerleadingWell – it’s all going well so far, this “staying in for ever” thing.

But I don’t mind being angry, as that is the thing that stops me being depressed. So far I have managed to have a row with the foolish hippies in the local health food shop about the stupid sign in the window about the only doctors you need being Dr Happy and Dr Nutrition and some other new-age nonsense. I merely pointed out that we might need, you know … some actual doctors.Special venom has been reserved for joggers ( I note they now all call themselves runners) who pound every public place full of mucus, assuming they have right of way, and never seeming to observe the two-metre rule. Stay in. Do star jumps.Then there are the public figures whom it is now finally permissible to hate, from Kirstie Allsopp, currently writing a diary of self-absorption, to Prince Charles, who managed to get tested, even though the BBC reported that his symptoms had been ‘“mild” – and this at a time when most frontline workers have not had tests – to the usual roll-call of businessmen who turn out to be selfish monsters. Whoever coulda known?But my biggest bugbear at the moment is the well-meaning advice trotted out all the time by people who clearly have no real understanding of how life is for most people. I comprehend that there are many decent folk trying to help people with their mental health. All of this advice can be summed up in one word: structure. None of it does anything for me as it also weirdly assumes some superannuated Protestant work ethic that is clearly no longer applicable.What is this getting up early and sitting at your desk fully dressed nonsense? Anyone who has had a truly shite job knows that pretending to look busy when there is nothing to do is harder work than any actual work.So here is the chance: do nothing.

Her business outgoings are £800 a month her incomings are now zero, and she has no savings. A diabetic, she fears not only contracting coronavirus, but dying from it. “I’m feeling very much abandoned by the government,” she says.The welfare state always had sizeable cracks which were only widened by a decade of austerity. In the age of the coronavirus, they are now yawning chasms, and there is a long way for people like Kimani to fall. Millions of British workers earn their keep through the gig economy or self-employment for some, it’s because they value a sense of freedom for others, it’s because it suits companies to be able to opt out of paying workers a guaranteed minimum wage or offering rights like occupational sick pay or holiday pay.Indeed, these sectors have been nurtured as a deliberate strategy: in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash, the Confederation of British Industry – the bosses’ spokespeople – suggested the crisis was an opportunity to expand a “flexiforce” of precarious workers, with a reduced core workforce of permanent workers with full rights. In 2016, it was reported that self-employed people earned less than two decades earlier. As Covid-19 overwhelms the economy’s immune system, all remaining vestiges of security for these workers has been stripped away.Their specialisms are varied indeed: they are gas engineers, plasterers, pet sitters, carpenters, hairdressers, construction workers, bouncers, comedians, yoga instructors, chefs, sports coaches, delivery drivers, wedding florists, animators and theatre directors– you name it.They are Uber drivers like Ray Thomas, whose income has fallen to zero but has a taxi insurance worth £200 a month and car payment of £120 a week to pay, alongside rent, bills and food. He has anxiety and depression and told me he had “a bit of a breakdown the other day when I found out the only thing available was the £94.25 universal credit”.They are kayak coaches like Chris Shaw, who taught Boris Johnson’s children and says he now feels “hung out to dry” by him. He has two young sons to feed and just £2,000 worth of savings from his grandfather’s inheritance.They are jewellery designers like Jess Jones, who is five months pregnant and now has an income that is all but gone, leaving her feeling “completely forgotten about”.There are no weddings, and so Hannah Millard’s photography skills are no longer required: her eldest son has a rare illness that last year left him in hospital for four months. “Without financial help, my successful business will fail and I will go bankrupt,” she tells me. “I feel absolutely crushed.” For now, their supposed lifeline has been the government’s bungled universal credit scheme, offering £94.25 a week with a five-week wait: the number of applicants nationally is 10 times higher than usual. In Wolverhampton jobcentre, a universal credit work coach tells me that normally they deal with 70 claims it’s now up to 1,200 and yet staff numbers are down to a third because of self-isolation. The services are simply overwhelmed.Rosie Parsnips, a hairdresser in Hayfield, Derbyshire, tells me that when she called the selfemployed helpline, she wasn’t even placed in a queue. Many are private renters and the government’s much-vaunted no-evictions policy in practice means giving tenants three months’ notice before they get the boot instead of two, all while building up rent arrears. Belatedly, the government is poised to offer help its proposals must be scrutinised to ensure every single self-employed and gig economy worker has the income they require to support themselves and their dependants. But government briefings to sympathetic newspapers suggest such support wouldn’t be available until the end of May, and that ministers are concerned about any system that “took away the incentive to work”, which is the entire point.There is a more straightforward solution, one that has even been touted by that well-known Trot, the Conservative MP for Gainsborough, Sir Edward Leigh. It is a universal basic income, where everyone is granted a sum of money by the state as a right of citizenship and with no strings attached.At the very least, it should be offered immediately and without preconditions not just to precarious and self-employed workers who fear what their plight will be next week – let alone next month – but to those who have suffered cuts to their hours and therefore pay, and the ever-surging numbers being cast into redundancy despite the government’s wage-subsidy programme. The Royal Society of Arts has come up with a plan: a one-off immediate payment of £1,500 and then additional monthly payments of £450, combined with universal credit and housing costs.Yet our government has ruled out this sensible idea, arguing that UBI would end up in the bank accounts of those who do not need it. There is a simple answer here: recoup that money by increasing taxes on the wealthy. We know that if a scheme is not universal, then it is bureaucratic, and many who need it will end up missing out. For example, it’s estimated that 1.3 million households eligible for means-tested pension credit don’t receive it. Perhaps the Conservatives fear the historical precedent of income tax, first introduced as a temporary measure to fund the Napoleonic wars in the late 18th century. But ideology is no excuse not to act decisively.An age of gaping wounds is no time for sticking plasters. If the government wishes to rescue millions who find themselves abruptly thrown into icy waters with no life boats, UBI represents the only guarantee. Whether the government has the courage to prove their critics wrong remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccde8fa456a474999a7238a1d766176a6e574db1/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e89d08caa045739d9ed545235912ac3","title":"amy poehler one must try to be a good citizen at this time","story":"The Parks \u0026amp Recreation star on the joy of Galentine’s Day and classic British sitcoms – and how Leslie Knope would be getting on in quarantineIn the week that I speak to Amy Poehler, three different friends have told me that they are planning to rewatch Parks \u0026amp Recreation to distract them from what’s happening in the world. “I hear that a lot,” says the star of the show, the woman who played the irrepressibly upbeat civil servant Leslie Knope, for 10 years and 125 episodes.Poehler is the kind of comedian, writer, actor and director who has plenty of “best known for” roles to choose from. She joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2001 and her and Tina Fey, who played the Sarah Palin to her Hillary Clinton, became the first female duo to flank the famous Weekend Update of the show. Then came Parks \u0026amp Recreation, a workplace comedy that became so popular it was able to introduce a whole new holiday, called Galentines’ Day, into the calendar on 14 February.Poehler is holed up at home in Los Angeles when I call. “One must try to be a good citizen at this time,” she says, Knope-ishly. She is happy to talk about the soothing effects of one of her most famous roles. “Leslie would not do well with quarantine,” she laughs. “She’d probably go a little bananas.”Recently, Poehler watched some old Parks \u0026amp Rec episodes and found a couple of them to be particularly prescient. “In one, there’s a government shutdown. This woman stood up in a town hall meeting and said: ‘My children are getting out of school in two weeks. What am I supposed to do with them, keep them in my house where I live?’” she says. “There’s an episode where everybody in town gets the flu and I was thinking: ‘Oh boy, this is a little close to home.’”Parks \u0026amp Rec ended in 2015, which left Poehler free to write, direct and produce, as well as act. She has several projects on the go: Moxie, the YA adaptation she directed for Netflix the second season of the brilliant Russian Doll, which she co-created but which is now on hold (“Season two is written and ready and we’re so excited to get started shooting that”). Should the ceremony go ahead, she and Fey will return to host the Golden Globes in January. We are here to talk about Duncanville, the new animated series Poehler created with The Simpsons’ writers Mike Scully and Julie Thacker Scully, about the life of Duncan, a very average 15-year-old boy.“There is so much pressure on kids to be very special,” Poehler explains. “Mike and I were always laughing about it. We are Gen X-ers when we were growing up, no one told you you were special.” How easy was it to get inside the head of a teenage boy? “Shockingly easy,” she laughs. “Everything is very exasperating at that age, because you have very little control, but there’s a lot of people that are asking you what do you want to do with your life – there’s a lot of pressure to do the right thing.”It is new territory for Poehler to be voicing a teenage boy. “I am such a fan of the iconic female voices voicing young boys, whether it be Nancy Cartwright doing Bart, or Pamela Adlon in King of the Hill,” she says. The show is not only about Duncan – it also touches on his relationships with his dad (voiced by Modern Family’s Ty Burrell), his sister, his cool-girl crush, Mia (played by Parks and Rec alumni Rashida Jones), and his mother, Annie.When it came to casting Mia, Poehler says she only wanted Jones. “With a lot of my friends, the only time I get to see them as I work with them.”Poehler and Jones still celebrate Galentines’ Day – the platonic celebration of female friendship made popular by their characters in Parks \u0026amp Rec. This year, they met up with Parks \u0026amp Rec castmates Aubrey Plaza and Kathryn Hahn. Poehler won’t take credit for the term – Michael Schur wrote the episode it appears in – “but it’s awesome to add another fake holiday to the fake holiday canon, and I personally think it’s much more fun than Valentine’s Day”.Given that so many people seem to be turning to Parks \u0026amp Rec for comfort, is there anything that Poehler herself is finding solace in? Old British comedy, it turns out. “You know the old Julia Davis, Rob Brydon one, where they play all those couples?” Human Remains? “Oh my God, so funny!” It can feel strange talking about television at a time like this, but, as Poehler says, comedy is “a very wonderful connector and distractor … Let me just put it this way, these characters don’t know that a pandemic is going on,” she says. Our time is up, so she says goodbye, still laughing at the thought of Brydon and Davis. “I’m gonna go back and watch it again right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/138efae6c1f54de240996723bcda1e4eb2c1e390/0_0_2616_3543/master/2616.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53921618fd991f0178272c6d06250107 1400w","title":"my favourite film aged 12 peter bradshaw on juggernaut","story":"Continuing the series in which our writers revisit childhood movie passions, our film critic finds that mid-Atlantic bomb thriller Juggernaut from 1974 still gets his palms sweatingDo you cut the red wire or the blue wire? One renders the explosive mechanism harmless. The other causes everyone to die in an almighty explosion. And you make your decision as the sweat pours off your forehead, and makes your fingers holding the pliers slippery, with the traditional, sadistically pointless digital clock installed in the device inexorably counting down to zero … red wire? … blue wire? … red wire? … blue wire? … tick, tick, tick.Talk about being triggered. In 1974, while the nation went into stoic semi-denial about the IRA bombing campaign, I went into a trance of excitement about the bomb-disposal suspense thriller Juggernaut, which was showing at the Watford Odeon in the school holidays. The cinema had just been split into three screens: a big one upstairs in the former balcony, and two small screens downstairs created by partitioning the rear stalls. My memory is that I was in one of these boxy “minis”.Apparently inspired by a bomb hoax on the QE2 a couple of years previously — though I’ve only just found that out now — Juggernaut was about a terrifying mega-bomb planted on a transatlantic ocean liner called the Britannic, sailing from Southampton to New York. The seas are too rough for the passengers to be taken off in lifeboats. The Irish-accented bomber (codenamed: Juggernaut) telephones the liner company boss with a surprisingly modest ransom demand for £500,000 (rather like Dr Evil naively requesting a “million dollars”.) Richard Harris plays the scotch-swilling cavalier tough guy with the reckless courage and intuitive bomb-disabling ability who is parachuted to the ship with his team to do the business. David Hemmings is his loyal assistant.Juggernaut had a very good cast. Apart from Harris, there was Omar Sharif, who gave a diffident, slightly torpid performance as the ship’s captain, having an ungallant affair with a beautiful passenger (Shirley Knight) Ian Holm is the company chief, Anthony Hopkins is the Scotland Yard cop whose wife and kids are aboard the Britannic Roy Kinnear is the frantic entertainment director who at one point actually says “Hi-de-hi!”. Roshan Seth is the Ugandan Asian steward who can switch accents to white-Brit when it is expedient. Veteran American character actor Clifton James (who was the glowering sheriff in the Bond films Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun) plays an American tourist. Cyril Cusack has an uncredited role as the defiantly uncooperative IRA veteran who is questioned by Hopkins in prison about who might be behind this. His questioning now looks very gentlemanly. The director is Richard Lester and the writer is Richard Alan Simmons who demanded to be credited as Richard DeKoker after a quarrel about the way his script was rewritten. (Again, I’m finding out about this now.)I loved Juggernaut as a 12-year-old, though it didn’t have the high gloss of big Hollywood disaster movies such as The Poseidon Adventure. And watching it again now, what strikes me is the awful weather: the cloudcover of this-is-not-America Britishness, which instantly signalled the fact that this is coming from Blighty not California. The Britannic is very different from the sleek digital hallucination of James Cameron’s Titanic. It is a real ship: with unsightly rust marks on the hull where the anchor comes up. The scenes on board make it look like a ropey cross-Channel ferry. I sat through it pop-eyed with my Kia-Ora and carton of Maltesers, before staggering out into the bland weekday sunshine of Watford High Street, the world of Dolcis shoe shops and Clements department store, weirdly not much less glamorous than the Britannic, with its world of slightly depressed passengers making the best of things and not questioning authority. (Some years later, Linsday Anderson’s Britannia Hospital was offered as a condition-of-Britain metaphor. Maybe we should have been thinking the same way about Lester’s ocean liner Britannic.)So I sat down to this again, thinking that Juggernaut would just look hilariously awful. But no. Actually, it’s a really tough, forthright, well-made action thriller which holds together tremendously well, and despite the creaky, groany moments … well … the big bluered wire finale had me on the edge of my seat. Juggernaut now has an almost gritty social-realist look.And watching it now, something hit me like being whacked over the head with a frying pan. “Juggernaut” is Irish — BUT SO IS RICHARD HARRIS! CLANGGGG! Of course, Harris’s character has to be Irish, at least subliminally (his own accent is subdued and he is a Royal Navy officer,) so that there is the all-important non-controversial political balance.Fans of 70s trivia and ephemera will love things like the kids playing on the rudimentary Pong computer game in the ship’s lounge bar and the arcade-style pinball machines. (We 70s kids really did do a lot of playing on these games on holiday, or hanging around pennilessly looking at them.) And we get to see some vintage “executive” novelty desk toys that were all the rage in those days.There are, of course, also some dodgy attitudes, in throwaway “funny” lines that have clearly been dubbed in post-production. As the Britannic departs, leaving the crowds behind on the quayside, we hear a campy voice: “Right, Humphrey, my place or yours?” Oo-er. Similarly, a south Asian deckhand dealing with a dog on board mutters: “I’ll have you in a bloody curry if you don’t move.” Yikes. Yet later, Seth’s steward will tell Knight that he has endured racism in both Uganda and Britain and it is a “sad world for refugees”.There is also an outrageously and, in fact, dangerously real-looking Sweeney-type cop car scene as Hopkins’s vehicle careers around the streets, almost hitting some kids as it screeches to a halt. It really does look as if risks were taken. Also, there is an amazing scene as Harris and his comrades parachute from the plane. The mask of one jumper comes off and you can hear: “Christ! Bloody mask!” Again, it really did look like a real mishap. And the scenes showing the jumpers getting hauled aboard the ship from the sea are amazingly well done and genuinely gripping.Juggernaut feels more like an old-fashioned war movie than a disaster movie, and Harris’s character is supposed to have learned his trade disabling Nazi bombs in the blitz. It’s a period piece from both the 40s and 70s. Surprisingly entertaining and effective. And the message that things will be all right in the end due to the dedication and expertise of professionals … that is also acceptable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70be18b315188fdb2f146cd32b6f6ab9c9f5deee/0_0_1459_875/master/1459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0076e3b949e8c71331247b12425dd26a","title":"fish ponds and water harvesting climate smart farming comes to kenya","story":"Unable to rely on the catch from Lake Victoria, locals are finding success with new and sustainable agriculture methodsIt might not be clear why a fish pond project should take root in a region surrounding the great Lake Victoria. After all, as the second largest freshwater lake in the world, it should be able to support the fish and the people that depend on its resources.But the fact that fish farming is fast expanding here highlights a worrying trend – that the fish population in Lake Victoria has been in steady decline and the quality of what is being caught has been going down too, jeopardising the livelihoods of millions.Overfishing, pollution and the invasive water hyacinth plant, among other factors, are to blame for the decline. The situation is so bad that cheap tilapia imports from China are now sold in the lake city of Kisumu, edging out local fishmongers.The fishermen are finding it difficult to compete. These fish, from thousands of miles away, are cheaper than those caught just down the road in the lake.Now villagers are turning to farming to address the shortages, something which would have been inconceivable only a few years ago.“We are left with no choice but to farm fish in the ponds now,” says John Obuom, from Kamulla village in the Store Pamba area of Kisumu county.With his wife Pauline Achieng, Obuom has successfully reared catfish since 2018 in five ponds on their three-acre plot. They started with 1,000 fingerlings and have since harvested twice.He has been trained by international development organisations including World Neighbors and Vi Agroforestry on simple, sustainable agricultural practices as well as water-harvesting techniques.“I am now able to harvest and store water from surface run-off, which has made a big difference in my farm,” he says. And it is not so difficult to see why.Obuom is a successful farmer. He grows mangoes, tomatoes, citrus, bananas and cucumbers, in addition to popular Kenyan indigenous vegetables such as the black nightshade.He is held up as a model farmer in the region. High school and university students regularly visit his farm to learn about how sustainable agriculture works in practice.Obuom is now part of a year-long, ongoing study on agricultural finance, through what is known as the financial diary tool.“This tool will show how spending patterns influence climate-smart agricultural practices,” says Anthony Musyimi, an agriculture masters student at the University of Nairobi.The financial diary tool is a joint effort between the University of Nairobi, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands and CCAFS – a research programme on climate change, agriculture and food security.This study is looking at the financial data of 122 households in the Nyando Basin, including Kisumu county.Musyimi has been collecting data from Obuom for the past 48 weeks. He will conclude his findings this month, a year after he began.Obuom uses nutrient-rich waste water from his fish ponds to irrigate his crops. The water has also enabled him to put up 10 beehives, each of which yields between eight and 10 litres of honey every three to four months.“Bees cannot survive without water,” he says.And for women of the local Luo community, once banned from owning a boat or even entering the waters in the lake region, there are opportunities to get involved. They can now raise fish in a pond without breaking any cultural taboos, supplementing their household incomes.Chris Macoloo, the Africa regional director for World Neighbors, maintains that using fish ponds has advantages over open-water artisanal fishing, because the latter “is more of a hunter-gatherer system, with no prior knowledge of the expected quantity of catch”.The development organisation has trained farmers in modern integrated farming techniques. Up to 20 farmers now have fish ponds only 20km from the lake.“The fish ponds are very cheap to maintain, because you give the fish local feed,” says catfish farmer Eddy Ouko."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4827a0044bfd4367ac88a11364b3c94c35b92c6/0_181_5359_3217/master/5359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=450e3a8f6bb323943c127a32533744d6","title":"indonesia could have thousands of hidden coronavirus cases study says","story":"It was just last month that Indonesia’s coronavirus cases stood at zero, with officials fiercely rejecting suggestions that infections were spreading undetected.Weeks later, 78 fatalities have now been linked to the virus, the highest number in south-east Asia. Seven health workers are among those who have died.While confirmed case have risen to almost 900, researchers have estimated that there could be tens of thousands of hidden infections across the country, and there is growing concern that medical facilities will be unable to cope in the event of a major outbreak.Over the past week, two major hospitals have appealed for supplies, while some healthworkers threatened to go on strike after they were forced to wear raincoats for protection. As of Monday, as many as 42 medical staff were infected with coronavirus in Jakarta.“I just pray and have faith so that I can stop worrying, even though sometimes that feeling (of worry) appears again,” Agnes Tri Harjaningrum, a paediatrician who works in state and private hospitals in the capital, told the . She fears the country could face a crisis similar to that experienced in Italy.Donations of protective equipment and testing kits arrived from China on Monday morning, but by Tuesday night shortages remained in some of Jakarta’s hospital wards. Equipment is being prioritised for doctors who are directly handling patients, she said.Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, was slow to carry out tests, having reportedly performed only a few hundred earlier this month. While cases were detected throughout February in most countries across south-east Asia, it was not until 2 March that the country of 264 million people confirmed its first infections. A study by Harvard University, which analysed air traffic from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, had raised questions over the country’s previous lack of cases. The health minister responded at the time by describing the analysis as “insulting” and stating the country was on high alert.The president has since acknowleged the need for mass testing, which is being ramped up in priority areas. So far 2,863 have been tested.The researchers emphasise that these are rough estimates based on preliminary analysis and it is not yet peer reviewed.According to official figures, the capital Jakarta, home to 9.6 million people, is among the worst hit, with hundreds of cases, while dozens of infections have also appeared in Banten and West Java.Cases appear to be scattering. In West Papua, the easternmost province of Indonesia, three cases have been confirmed while 35 people have been put under surveillance because they have symptoms including pneumonia and have had contact with a confirmed patient.Access to quality health care is limited in the province, especially in highland areas, and health workers are currently assessing patients online because of equipment shortages.Analysis by Reuters suggests that the country’s health system is significantly less well resourced than that of Italy or South Korea, which have both faced major outbreaks.Indonesia has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data, which is equal to about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).In 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.Indonesia is converting the athlete’s village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital, which it is hoped will be able to treat 24,000 patients.Modelling by the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit (EOCRU), reported by the Jakarta Post, has suggested that, without tough steps to contain the virus, there could be up to 71,000 infections by the end of April.Jakarta’s governor has declared a state of emergency, and told businesses and religious groups to take measures to stop the spread of the virus.

On Thursday, a government panel of experts said it feared that coronavirus infections were “rampant” in Japan, sparking speculation that the government would strengthen restrictions on movement and encourage social distancing.Those concerns were echoed in Hong Kong, where a health expert said the territory’s public health system could collapse unless the government introduced measures to keep people apart, as global infections rose to more than 470,000 and deaths passed 21,000.Ho Pak-leun, an infectious diseases expert at Hong Kong University, told local radio that unless Hong Kong brought in a curfew or lockdown-style restrictions, there would be “serious consequences”.Hong Kong has largely been successful in preventing an epidemic, but in recent weeks has seen a surge in infections, primarily among returning travellers. Non-residents are banned from entering Hong Kong, and anyone else arriving must quarantine themselves for 14 days, but shops, restaurants and bars remain open.“The government should not implement one-off measures bit by bit any more,” Ho said.In other global developments:• The US Senate passed a historic US$2tn stimulus package. The measure, which was unopposed, is the biggest of its kind in US history and came as the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the US passed 1,000.• China reported no new locally transmitted cases for the second day in a row. Mainland China did however report an increase in new confirmed cases, to 67, all of which involved travellers arriving from abroad.• The economic downturn and job losses caused by the pandemic is likely to be worse than the 2008 recession, according to World Trade Organization projections.• Singapore is heading for a deep recession, data shows. Singapore has suffered its biggest economic slump for a decade, according to preliminary growth figures for the first three months of the year.• Thailand barred entry into the kingdom late on Wednesday, enacting sweeping emergency powers in a bid to stem the local spread of the coronavirus outbreak.• Mexico’s federal government is suspending all non-essential activities from Thursday, Mexico’s deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said.• US authorities are preparing to bring home tens of thousands of people more than they had expected. As many as 50,000 Americans may need their government’s help in getting home, the US State Department said.• More than 400,000 people have volunteered to help the UK’s National Health Service. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, says the government had hoped 250,000 people would volunteer to help those in isolation by delivering medicines, transporting patients and making regular phone calls to check up on them.• Italy’s infection rate slowed for the third consecutive day. The World Health Organization said the country could reach its peak number of coronavirus cases on Sunday.In Hong Kong, executive council member Lam Ching-choi told public broadcaster RTHK the government was considering restricting the number of people that can get together at one time. Lam said it was considering banning gatherings at certain times of the day.Health officials in China said it had 67 new cases but none of them were locally transmitted. Hong Kong saw 24 new cases on Thursday, most of them recent arrivals.Social media users in Japan posted photos of empty supermarket shelves after Koike’s announcement on Wednesday evening, while other stores appeared to be running very low only on items such as pasta, rice, instant noodles and toilet paper.Tokyo – a city of 13 million people – reported 41 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the largest daily number and more than double the number reported the previous day. With a total of 212 cases, Tokyo has overtaken the northern island of Hokkaido, previously the most affected of Japan’s 47 prefectures.Koike also encouraged Tokyo residents to work at home on weekdays and avoid restaurants in the evening. Large-scale events should be cancelled through to 12 April, she added. “Starting this week, there are increasing concerns that we could see an explosion of infections,” Koike said, adding that she would consider more stringent measures if the rise in new cases could not be contained.The coronavirus outbreak has infected 1,271 people across Japan, with 44 deaths linked to the virus, the public broadcaster NHK said. Those figures do not include 712 cases and 10 deaths aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner, which was quarantined in Yokohama last month. The foreign ministry has urged people to avoid all non-essential overseas travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a274385c0093a4ed9fea2bd6d329e26dd3a5bcc/0_0_5212_3126/master/5212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=438fdd4231174d588b0bd31aef1eb73c","title":"how coronavirus wrecked marriage plans","story":"The US had 845,000 weddings slated for March through May but the pandemic has prompted disappointment, delays and some creative thinkingJennifer Clymer and Edgar Pablos have a relationship right out of When Harry Met Sally. After the Los Angelenos met on a film set in 1999, they became fast friends, performing the stand-by-me act for one another through years of mutual failed attempts at finding lasting love.As dyed-in-the-wool Gen Xers, Clymer, 48, and Pablos, 47, share an obsession with classic 80s cinema. So naturally the say-anything bosom buddies finally up-shifted to full romcom hyperdrive after they pulled into a drive-in showing of The Goonies in 2015.“Don’t forget the ketchup for the waffle fries,” Clymer admonished Pablos from the car as he fetched the snacks.The way he looked back at her, she recalls, “It was like the Princess Bride moment.”As you wish, he replied – with his puppy-dog gaze.To paraphrase Meg Ryan: and then they fell in love.In April 2019, they got engaged, setting their LA wedding for 20 June 2020.And then the coronavirus pandemic hit.As a fast-increasing number of cities and states, Los Angeles and California among them, have imposed progressively stringent restrictions on gatherings in an attempt to flatten the curve of new Covid-19 cases, Clymer and Pablos have joined the legions of couples with spring and early-summer wedding dates who in recent weeks have seen their big day’s plans upended by the swift and devastating onset of the coronavirus pandemic.The couple has nevertheless maintained a Goonies-never-say-die outlook. They emailed their 250 invited guests on Friday to say they had postponed their wedding indefinitely, but weren’t heartbroken, “because this party does not mark the beginning of our commitment to each other, it celebrates the commitment that we have already made”.The best man’s father called to thank Clymer and Pablos for not compelling him to choose between possibly jeopardizing his health by attending the wedding and not supporting the couple.Pablos was brought to tears.According to the wedding planning and registry resource The Knot, the United States has 845,000 weddings slated for March through May alone.The Knot has launched a coronavirus hotline with its partner brand WeddingWire, and reports that many engaged couples calling in for guidance have said they’re downsizing to a small gathering at their parents’ house, or getting legally married in the short-term and planning a vow renewal ceremony on their first wedding anniversary.For the $78bn US wedding industry as a whole, the coronavirus-driven death knell came on 15 March when the CDC advised against gatherings of 50 people or more for the subsequent eight weeks.The chaotic fallout has included a mad scramble to postpone upcoming wedding dates, which in turn has fostered intense competition to secure the fast-dwindling slots available for late summer and fall bookings in particular.Such relatively near-term rescheduling is predicated on what may prove to have been magical thinking, given the current uncertainty of the US epidemic: that society will ultimately return to a significant shade of normal within the next three or four months.Pablos and Clymer, for their part, are already accustomed to virus-induced delays. Early last year, a flu she suffered stymied his cinematic vision for popping the question during a scheduled trip to Colorado that would have afforded a jaunt to a gorgeous snow-filled valley. So the film-maker scouted a new exterior location in New Mexico, near his parents’ home in El Paso – the site of their next trip. This provided his ultimate, successful proposal with a sandy backdrop, plus snow-dusted mountains in the distance.The cinephiles remain determined to marry at their original venue, the Motion Picture \u0026amp Television Fund retirement community for showbiz vets in Woodland Hills, California. Clymer works there and wants all the retirees she’s bonded with to attend her reception in their own backyard. (The actress Connie Sawyer, who appeared in the relationship-recap vignette that opens When Harry Met Sally and who died at 105 in 2018, was a dear friend.) For now, such a gathering is impossible given the need to protect seniors in particular from coronavirus.The near-instant loss or postponement of an entire busy season of weddings is proving disastrous for the 1.2 million people and the nearly 400,000 business that owe at least part of their incomes to the industry of matrimony. Everyone from wedding planners and caterers to florists and furniture rental companies have been blindsided.“The pandemic could change the industry,” says Olivier Cheng, president of Olivier Cheng Catering \u0026amp Events in New York City, a metropolitan area that has emerged this week as an epicenter of the global pandemic, with 17,853 testing positive for coronavirus and 199 people dying of Covid-19 as of Wednesday morning. “Our business model may need to evolve to survive.”With the overall events industry also crushed by the sweeping loss of corporate and non-profit jobs, the economic damage has only reverberated outward into other sectors.“We as an industry employ more Broadway actors than Broadway,” says Carla Ruben, president of the New York City and Miami–based catering company Creative Edge Parties. The company has already rescheduled 20 weddings through July – the lion’s share of their annual take.Cheng reports that during peak-season times, he will sign a two-week payroll amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars – money that he knows goes to support the artistic ambitions and families of hundreds of workers.“One of the reasons that I’m so proud of my business is I give people a livelihood,” Cheng says. As his payroll has plummeted to below $10,000 for the foreseeable future, he reports suffering a father’s heartbreak from not being able to provide for his sprawling family of workers.“On the bright side,” Ruben says, “There are still people getting engaged right now because they’re all stuck in their homes together and they’re realizing they’re with the people they want to be with.”Matt Kunkel, 24, and Emma Gassett, 25, know the feeling well. The two New York City theater industry professionals have delayed their Long Island wedding, originally slated for the end of the month, to July. In the meantime, they’re cooped up in their snug Manhattan one-bedroom.“The biggest test of a marriage is surviving quarantine together,” Kunkel says. “But there’s no one better to go through all this with than your best friend and the love of your life.”Interviews with dozens of engaged couples and industry pros suggest that by and large, flexibility is the new name of the game for wedding venues and vendors when it comes to rescheduling dates. As best as they can manage financially, they’re inclined to observe a sense of goodwill in the face of a universal crisis and overlook contract clauses – known as force majeures – that would normally impose a financial penalty on couples for postponements.Small businesses that depend on referrals would also like to avoid possibly besmirching their reputation by charging already distressed clients for altering their wedding plans given the extraordinary circumstances.Newlyweds Amber Matlock, 30, and Teyanna Noren, 26, of Tacoma, Washington, benefited from such generosity after the original venue for their planned 100-person wedding was forced to cancel on them with just eight days’ notice due to the state’s new restrictions on crowd sizes.“I started bawling my eyes out,” Matlock says.Fortunately, the couple was swiftly able to find a new, gorgeously bucolic spot for their scaled-down vows: an indoor-outdoor venue called The Five2Five in the rural town of Buckley, which is nestled at the foothills of Mount Rainier about 30 miles south-east of Seattle.“I started tearing up several times when we were at the venue,” Noren recalls, “because it was like, ‘We have hope again.’”The original reception site, Lake Wilderness Lodge, refunded the couple in full. And despite the fact that their reservation at The Five2Five came at a higher price point, the new company allowed them to pay no more than they had originally.Matlock and Noren’s wedding planner, Bianca Mattingly, helped secure agreements from the venue, caterer, DJ and photographer to work a short elopement ceremony plus a first dance last weekend, with a promise to return for a full-fledged wedding celebration at the same site in a year’s time. None have charged extra.In keeping with her industry’s guiding ethos, Mattingly is a fierce advocate for keeping romance alive – now more than ever.“People are scared, they need some hope,” she says.Further bolstering Matlock and Noren’s spirits, the typically curmudgeonly Pacific north-west weather gods blessed them with an atypically warm and cloud-free day last Friday, allowing the joyous brides to wed within a mid-afternoon glow.The 25 guests – just close friends and family – were each spaced six feet apart. There was lots of hand sanitizer and plenty of tissues to go around.As for Clymer and Pablos, after 21 years of friendship, waiting one more year to marry is no sweat for them. Because when they realized they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with one another, they realized that the rest of their lives had already begun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76a9fc21b88d30d271d0d15c05c22528cca51215/963_294_5051_3031/master/5051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=184a75addd26554b3ca87604b6e954d3","title":"your place or mine coronavirus forces couples to choose","story":"Relationships fast-tracked as couples move in together for lockdownNot long ago, the longest time Ewa Lelontko had spent in her partner’s company was two weeks.For all of their one-year relationship, Lelontko, 31, was living in Brighton while Diego Vidal-Cruzprieto, 30, was in York, studying for his PhD they saw each other every other weekend.Now they live and work together, forced into round-the-clock cohabitation by the coronavirus crisis.“We’re trying to work from one room, trying to exercise in front of each other,” says Lelontko. “Of course it’s testing our patience. We’re setting boundaries and we’re learning new things about each other, but actually, being together in this is really nice.“I know some couples who have to be separated – so we’re very lucky.”The choice they faced is far from unique. Travel restrictions have fast-tracked many relationships, at least temporarily. Faced with being apart indefinitely, many couples’ response has been to ask each other: your place, or mine?Jenny Harries, the UK’s deputy chief medical officer, reluctantly assumed the role of a relationship counsellor on Tuesday, confirming in a press conference that couples currently living separately should remain apart for the duration of the lockdown – or move in together.Concerns have been voiced for victims of domestic violence, trapped at home with their abusers. For new couples, there are different challenges. As Harries put it: “For quite a significant period going forwards, they should test the strength of their relationship.”Lelontko is optimistic, already anticipating separation anxiety once the lockdown lifts and she can return home to Brighton. “I think once we have to go back to our distance, we’re going to be missing each other more.” Another couple, Louisa Davies, 27, and her boyfriend of 18 months, had no plans to live together pre-corona. “It felt like quite a big jump,” she says.On Tuesday he moved into her south London home and, Davies says, it was the right decision given the uncertainty over when they would see each other next. “There’s pressure on both sides – the pressure of not seeing each other, or the pressure of being in a very contained situation for a long time, with no space.”People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.Meanwhile, for Fajah, 27, from Hampshire, (who only wanted his first name mentioned), there was no question of being separated from his partner of nearly two years – even though that meant coming out as gay to his conservative father.Fajah is out to his mother and sister, with whom he shares the family home, while his father has been living and working abroad: “I never thought I’d have to worry about telling him.” When his father returned to the UK last month as coronavirus spread, Fajah “bit the bullet” and told him he was gay. “It didn’t go down too well there was a lot of anger.”For Fajah, it was “more a practical necessity than an emotional case”. He says his choice was: “Will I not see any of my family, for however long lockdown goes, to save my dad from a little bit of tension – or put my partner in an intense situation?”After his partner moved in, Fajah says, “the first few days were a little awkward – but now we’re just doing our own things. It’s almost like having a house share.”And it is a “weird relief” to be out to his dad – the coronavirus crisis was just that “bit more of a push”.“Moving in together was another thing that I would have done anyway,” says Fajah, “but maybe not in quite the same way.”Many relationships have been fast-tracked. Serena Coady, 26, has been sharing her boyfriend’s houseboat on the Thames for the past two weeks they met two months ago. “It’s moved fast because of the current situation … neither of us want to be alone”.Some couples are seeing the positives. Alex Hickson, 23, from Leeds, had loose plans to move in with his boyfriend, Oliver, 32, later in the year. Coronavirus took off some of the pressure of taking that next step, he says.“I’d worry about all of the practicalities, when was the right time, if there was a right time. It’s kind of forced our hand, but I see it as more of a positive than a negative.”The biggest challenge has been working from home, says Hickson: “We’ve both realised that we put on phone voices that we’ve never heard before.”Arwyn Keast, 42, and Anna Leach, from Hastings, had been together for six months when the lockdown was announced. “There was a choice: we can either isolate from each other, or we can live together – from tomorrow, for an unknown amount of time,” says Keast. “I don’t think the former was an option, really – it could be months.”Since Leach moved in, he says, they have been helping each other to stay positive and keep their mind off the news. “It’s just so supportive to have someone there … I can only imagine what people are going through on their own.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c0c4ae63dfb2d316837d7344d98182c4f9cd4f1/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57d36bee4191ddd085132dd021fbdfc5","title":"authentication code security online banking mobiles","story":"I don’t own one but need an authentication code for online transactionsIt is getting very difficult to carry out financial transactions online because I do not carry a mobile phone.

This presents another difficulty because where I live there are no branches left. I’ve been forced to close an online-only Santander savings account ... because I was unable to access it. Banks are effectively forcing customers to carry a mobile.SCA is the result of a European Union directive to help prevent card-not-present fraud, which cost the UK £506m last year.

It told the Observer it’s looking into an “alternative solution” to ensure it meets the needs of all its customers, and pointed out its app works with wifi if a signal is poor.The banking trade body UK Finance says: “The industry is working hard to implement these changes in a way that balances both convenience and security, for example offering alternatives to text-based passcodes for those who don’t have access to a mobile.

We take a closer look at the well-known investment safe havenGold is the original precious metal. It is rich in symbolism but it’s also rich in function. Over millennia, it has been used for coins, jewellery, ornamentation, medals, electronic components, the basis of monetary systems and the titles of countless James Bond films. But, recently, people have been reminded of its historic use as a comparatively safe store of value.The bank was explaining why it still kept gold reserves. But during these times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, its words sparked media discussions about investors buying up gold in a flight to financial safety.Unlike cash, the value of gold isn’t eroded by inflation. It is highly fungible and can easily be converted into hard currency wherever you are in the world. In extreme cases, such as in war-torn countries, if you lose everything else, you can carry a couple of small gold bars out with you. It also has a great heritage and global branding given that people have historically relied on it during times of political turmoil. “For thousands of years gold has been a store of value,” says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, the online consumer investing platform.In recent months, the value of gold has increased amid concerns about the global economy and the spectre of a full-scale trade war between the US and China. The price of gold hit £1,278 an ounce last September as large numbers of investors bought into the precious metal during something of a rush to so-called “safe-haven” assets. These are lower-risk assets that are expected to retain their value or even grow in value when other assets fall – thereby helping investors to limit their exposure to losses. “You want assets that perform when the stock market doesn’t,” says Lowcock.Other safe-haven investments include defensive stocks that are less vulnerable to economic downturns, such as utility companies, supermarkets and other businesses that provide everyday essentials. Likewise, bonds usually offer more predictable returns than shares, and certain currencies such as the Yen and Swiss Franc are also seen as safe-haven investments.But while gold arguably remains the best-known financial safe haven, its safety as an investment largely depends on what you’re looking for.One of gold’s chief disadvantages as an investment is that it doesn’t provide you with an income. It pays no interest or idends, unlike shares or cash on deposit. The only money you make on gold is capital appreciation when the price goes up. However, in an economic environment where interest rates are very low (and bond yields are also very low), a lack of income from gold may not be that much of an issue.A bigger problem perhaps is that gold prices can and do fluctuate – and often considerably. In Davos, in 2010, George Soros famously said: “When interest rates are low we have conditions for asset bubbles to develop, and they are developing at the moment. The ultimate asset bubble is gold.”It’s also worth remembering that all safe-haven investments have potential downsides. Indeed, the only safe haven that can’t lose you money is cash – although it can lose you value in high inflation environments and it generally provides a poor return in low inflation environments such as the one we’re currently in.Of course, economic fundamentals aside, centuries of symbolism mean that gold’s emotional and psychological value is unlikely to fade any time soon. And as our faith in our financial system is continually tested, perhaps it will one day come to symbolise the important value of safety as much as wealth.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

According to the scientists’ calculations, if Usain Bolt mastered the contraption, his top speed would rocket from 27.8mph to nearly 50mph.“We wanted to see what physics allows and then explore it further by developing a device,” said David Braun, an engineer who works on human augmentation at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.“This shows us how far we can push the boundaries and what key features we should focus on to develop the new technology.”Braun hit on the idea after studying the mechanics of running and cycling. While the fastest human running speed on the flat is close to 28mph, the equivalent top cycling speed is nearer 50mph. Much of the difference is due to bicycles being in contact with the ground the whole time and the pedalling mechanism which allows the rider to power along constantly.What is needed, he reports in Science Advances, is a way for runners to do work when their feet are off the ground.Braun and his colleagues used computer models to test a number of theoretical devices that took into account air resistance, the power limit of the human leg and the energy that is lost when the foot impacts the ground. They concluded that a spring-powered device that attached to the legs could give runners the boost they sought.The principle behind the device is to store energy by compressing a spring when the runner lifts and bends their trailing leg before they swing it forwards. When the leg moves forward, the spring is locked and remains compressed until the foot hits the ground. Only then is the energy released to power the runner forwards.“This allows runners to do work during the aerial phase of the running motion,” Braun said. “It’s the key to borrowing the benefits of cycling and using them in running.”A second requirement is for the springs to be “programmable” so that the stiffness can be increased as the runner picks up speed. This can be done with a mechanism that steadily shortens how much of the spring can be compressed, since shorter springs are stiffer than longer ones.The effect, Braun said, is comparable to the gears on a bike that are switched up as the cyclist rides faster.Just as ice-skating and cycling take time to grasp, so might the final contraption take some mastering, the researchers admit.And while Braun hopes to have a demonstration model finished in a year, it may take several more years of development to reach its full potential.“At the early stage, it will look like an exoskeleton, but in the later stages we hope it will look like a shoe,” he said. “It’s one thing to build a prototype but quite another to miniaturise it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7510ad3f1b4a2591b88f04e7d667a5dc34ec0ab/0_0_1658_995/master/1658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eec6ec5cb2b989c5aaf6c8593fe39fa","title":"covid 19 can ibuprofen make an infection worse","story":"Nicola Davis speaks to Dr Ian Bailey about the current guidance on taking ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a Sars-CoV-2 infection.

That bald information does not suggest an urgent need for an anniversary article, but there was a little more to the story. Northwich were so short of players that their XI included three supporters, rounded up desperately in the hour before kick-off. One of them had already engaged in a different kind of warm-up: he’d been in the pub.This was not a bit of a laugh during a pre-season friendly, as when Harry Redknapp famously brought on a West Ham supporter at Oxford. It was a match against the league leaders. “It was a tremendous thing but it was a serious thing,” said Derek Nuttall, the chairman of Northwich in 1986. “The club would have been censured if we hadn’t put out a full team.”In the week before the game, the Northwich manager, Stuart Pearson, the former Manchester United and England forward, tried to get the game postponed because of injury and flu. “As it happened, the chairman of the league was Jim Thompson, and he was the chairman of Maidstone, so it would have been a bit of an embarrassment to him if the game had been called off,” said Nuttall. “That made it more complicated. They wouldn’t call it off.” Pearson tried again on the Friday night, calling the league secretary. “I think,” said Nuttall, “it was a fiery conversation.”Whether in a fit of pique or as a more considered protest, Pearson planned to start the game with eight players. Nuttall did not find this out until 2pm, an hour before kick-off. “That would have been a disaster,” he said. “So I went into the social club, into the lounge area where they were all having a drink and a pie and so on, and said: ‘Would anybody like a game of football?’ They all looked at me like I was mad.”Nuttall explained that he was serious, and soon had three takers. “One of them had to go home for his boots. One had them in the boot of his car. And the other man was the boy who normally did the Tannoy. He fancied himself as a centre-forward, so he played up front.”The secretary, Ian Merrell, urgently faxed off the necessary paperwork – in those days you could register a player up to half an hour before kick-off – and the match went ahead. The three were Steve Garnett, Mark Fogg and Rick Parkin. One of them had already enjoyed two pints and a pork pie, the worst preparation for a professional match since Tony Cascarino was seduced by the smells of Gillingham Wimpy.\u0002“The team played tremendously,” said Nuttall. “We had Gordon Hill, the former Manchester United winger, playing for us. The instructions to the three new lads were: ‘When you get the ball, give it to Gordon Hill.’ He controlled the game. He was at the end of his career but he was a brilliant player, and a tremendous character – he used to do an excellent impression of Bruce Forsyth.”Garnett, Fogg and Parkin did a decent impression of professional footballers. “They played OK,” said Nuttall. “You wouldn’t really have known that they weren’t professionals. A couple of them had played amateur football. They were so happy to be playing for the team they support and they raised their game.”The match ended 1-1, and nobody was in any doubt who claimed the moral victory. “It was very embarrassing for Maidstone, and we were called before the league and had to explain the situation,” said Nuttall. “It was called the Pie and Pints match. We had interest from all over the world, even New Zealand. It was so funny – funny but serious.” It was even reported in the Los Angeles Times. spoke to Derek Nuttall on Tuesday 18 October. The following day, he died suddenly. He was 89 and had been involved with Northwich for 81 years – first as a fan, then board member, chairman and secretary. Mike Talbot-Butler, the former sports editor of the Northwich , described Nuttall’s death as an “incalculable loss … If ever there was a one-club man it was he and I dread to think what might have happened to The Vics without his foresight, leadership and example.”Nuttall had been fighting to save Northwich, who have had all kinds of problems in recent years: they have no ground and have suffered forced relegations, their former owner Jim Rushe was sent to prison this year for conspiring to supply cocaine, and in 2012 members of their supporters’ trust broke away to form 1874 Northwich. “Whatever the problems in 1986-87, they are nothing to what confronts them today,” says Talbot-Butler. “There may be no NVFC in a year’s time and they have been operating without a break since 1874. We veered off in separate directions a couple of seasons ago with the breakaway of 1874 Northwich FC, because it was felt the old club was being taken down the wrong path by successive owners. Yet Derek remained loyal to the end and never wavered in his belief that to keep NVFC going was paramount. I was proud that 1874 Northwich remembered Derek with a well-observed two minutes’ silence before their FA Vase game against Billingham Synthonia.”Until he died, Nuttall was working to secure the club’s future. “The best tribute to him would be the club’s survival, which he had fought for over many years,” said Chris Nuttall, Derek’s son, in the Northwich . “I hope the town of Northwich, and Vics fans everywhere, can show a level of support to keep them going. That could be as simple as going to a game and cheering them on when Saturday comes.”Ideally with a pie in one hand and a pint in the other.• With thanks to John Buckley, Steve Garnett, Andrew Simpson, Mike Talbot-Butler and Stephen Yoxall"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eafb4ed3a4db161e649b7152f7713cd9e2d5e028/89_0_5263_3158/master/5263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2a9e4f462504fe6a087abd2c27b1ca5","title":"football classics alternative realities and staying occupied","story":"Plus ... remembering Johan Cruyff and esports taking over from the real thing 1) To accompany our retro MBM series, here’s some actual footage of the events we’re retrospectively describing.

There was an attempt 116 years ago to shut down rugby in Wales permanently: a religious revival regarded the sport an an affront to the Almighty and a number of clubs did close only for rugby to emerge as the country’s national sport.The revival started at the end of November 1904 when a trainee minister and former coal miner, Evan Roberts, began praying nightly, with a group of students from his home church in Loughor, that his life would be completely surrendered to God. Within a week it spread throughout the area and there many of the masses who were converted were not churchgoers. And then far beyond.“The Revival infused new hope and vigour in a Welsh nonconformity badly shaken by the growing secularism that accompanied the enormous changes that had visited late 19th-century Wales,” wrote the Welsh Rugby Union’s biographers, David Smith and Gareth Williams, in Fields of Praise.The revival condemned rugby, along with drinking and gambling. International tickets were torn up in public and jerseys ceremonially burnt. Rugby clubs suddenly closed down some, like Loughor, did not play again until 1909. After hearing Roberts preach at Kenfig Hill, one player announced to the congregation: “I used to play full-back for the Devil but now I am forward for God.”Morristown, Penygroes, Crynant, Ammanford and Senghenydd were among the clubs who suspended playing, prompting a visiting Frenchman, Jacques Rogues de Fursac, who had been commissioned by his government to report on the revival, to conclude that the Welsh temperament swung wildly from one extreme to another, a view Graham Henry was to echo more than 90 years later.Before the revival, Wales had come under pressure from some of its Four Nations rivals for conniving at professionalism. Ireland especially felt the Welsh had an advantage over the rest because many of their players were working class, gaining fitness and strength through their occupations.Wales won the triple crown in Dublin that year and Smith and Williams quote from a subsequent meeting of the Irish Rugby Football Union in Cork when a rise in admission prices was proposed to keep out the roughs.“Last year, the Welsh fellows broke in all over the ground and smashed up everything they could lay their hands upon,” said the union’s treasurer, who pointed out £50 had been paid for a dinner in Scotland’s honour but only £30 for Wales. “The reason for this was that champagne was given to the Scotsmen and beer only (but plenty of it) to the Welshmen. The Scotsmen were gentlemen and appreciated a dinner when it was given to them. Not so the Welshmen.”Thirteen months after the revival started, Wales beat New Zealand at Cardiff Arms Park. The 3-0 defeat was the only setback on the All Blacks’ 35-match tour of the four home unions and France that ended five months after it had started with two romps in California. Rugby developed a religious fervour in the country, a “collective bid for Paradise rather than an inidual dash for heaven was what came,” as Smith and Williams put it.“There was a semi-religious, almost fanatical invocation in the fervour when the great assembly (prompted by the Wales team who sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau after the haka) it was not the country’s national anthem then but soon was) took up the strain: the Land of My fathers, the Land of the Free,” wrote a reporter at the match. The singing, said the New Zealand captain Dave Gallagher, had more to do with his side’s defeat than anything else that happened.”The revival may have shut down some clubs rather than the game itself but it opened eyes and minds. The current position is far different but sport, at some point, will resume. If it can capture the collective spirit that was Roberts’s legacy, with the various strands that make up rugby working together rather than pre-occupied with self-interest, it will be the stronger for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb8d4ba2730e614ff27cd79cbc2fd2d4011ad6f7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cfc8a1158b418dea9adff106e27dd75","title":"comfort viewing our favourite shows to rewatch in lockdown","story":"From Tony Soprano’s ever-expanding waistline to Buffy’s student army, 10 writers tell us the TV they are most likely to rewatch – and whyWe all have that one show we turn to when we have scrolled through all of Netflix and found nothing else, when we need a brief window of distraction from life’s stresses, or if we want a nostalgic reminder of another, simpler time.Now, in lockdown and with bags of time on our hands, it seems like the perfect moment to revisit those box sets and indulge in hours of rewatching, away from the ever-present tyranny of choice.We asked 10 writers to take us through their rewatches of choice, from the gripping drama (and culinary delights) of The Sopranos, to the fast-paced political intrigue of The West Wing, the romantic trials of New Girl and Gossip Girl, as well as the niche fascinations of Law and Order: SVU. Or, if you would rather not live in the TV screen of the past, one writer argues to stick with the endless stream of the new.If the past is a foreign country, rewatching The Sopranos is like stepping into another universe entirely. The silken polo shirts and rattling gold bracelets, the flip-phones and leather-seated Sedans, the strippers and – above all – the sandwiches David Chase’s late-90s epic on mobsters reckoning with their consciences is endlessly rewatchable. So much so that I am about to embark on my third viewing of the six-season, 86-episode odyssey of James Gandolfini’s masterful Tony Soprano and the enduring chaos of his New Jersey family of mafiosos. While I might dip in and out of Friends for a comfort-rewatch, or turn to Bob’s Burgers for an easy laugh, it is almost impossible to watch single episodes of The Sopranos it is too granular and endlessly gripping. A tentative look back at a pivotal scene soon finds you four hours in, forgetting what happens next.And there are myriad narratives to follow: the evolution of Anthony Junior from chubby-cheeked tween to emotionally devastated young adult Meadow’s journey from daddy’s girl to fierce independence Uncle Junior’s entire aesthetic Livia’s decrepitude and Carmella’s relationship rollercoaster, from loyalty to defiance to begrudging acceptance. Of course, holding it all together are the fantastic performances by Gandolfini – whose weight gain over the seasons starts to make his heavy breathing its own marker of dramatic foreboding – and Lorraine Bracco who plays his increasingly conflicted therapist Jennifer Melfi. Their therapy sessions are a masterclass in zippy dialogue and unspoken emotion, as close as we can get to riveting conversation in this time of social isolation.The show ultimately manages to strike that ineffable balance between escapism and emotional realism, lending it endless depth and rewatch potential. If nothing else, the food is worthy of a repeat view: pepper-stuffed sandwiches, cannelloni, heart-busting ice-cream sundaes mouth-watering culinary inspiration for your quarantine. Ammar KaliaEvery few months, I like to imagine the decimal point of my bank account has shifted a few spots to the right and hang out with the hyper-privileged teens of New York City’s Upper East Side. The Gossip Girl world is so spectacularly removed from mine – even were I not self-isolating – that watching it gives me the same rush I imagine sci-fi fans get from films about sentient spaceships and alien incubators. The show follows a group of beautiful, obscenely wealthy teenagers living in palatial penthouses and the “poor” family that enters their orbit ah yes, so poor are the Humphreys that they are confined to a loft in Brooklyn. Their lives are so thrillingly interesting that an anonymous blogger, Gossip Girl, follows their every move by posting pap shots and salacious rumours. The plots sit somewhere between tabloid and high art: in one story arc, an 18-year-old billionaire trades his girlfriend for a hotel in another, an incest storyline isn’t even close to the weirdest thing in that series.Although things happen almost constantly, nothing ever really changes, which makes it perfect for unending rewatches. The script is overflowing with mixed metaphors and one character’s entire personality is that they love to cook waffles. It should be terrible. It should be consigned to the forgotten annals of Netflix for ever. And yet, it is amazing. The melodrama of your teens magnified by about one million percent and sprinkled with limitless money? Who wouldn’t want to watch that over and over again? Kate SolomonI have had the phrase: “Gave me cookie, got you cookie” swirling on a loop in my head for three days. Buried among every terrible coronavirus-related pun I have come up with to distract myself from the most bizarre and eerie global situation in my lifetime, is the grouchy voice of New Girl’s Nick Miller delivering this line. Startlingly, it has become a sort of meditative balm. Inhale … gave me cookie exhale … got you cookie.To say New Girl is my favourite show would be an understatement. I mark my life through New Girl rewatches and sometimes I lay in bed and genuinely wonder if Nick, the recalcitrant bartender turned YA author with questionable hygiene habits (I would definitely have got the ’Rona from him) is my ideal man. The seven-season sitcom starring Zooey Deschanel as the titular character has its axis in friendship. Zooey’s sweet, quirky Jess becomes a room-mate to three men with wildly different personalities (douchey Schmidt, grumpy Nick, unexplainable weirdo Winston), and along with her feisty best friend Cece, becomes enmeshed in ridiculous hijinks with them as they meld into a highly dysfunctional and incestuous family.The show is funny without losing its heart and sweet without becoming cloying. It has all the intimate tenderness of a dear friend roasting you before pulling you into a hug. I started watching New Girl while depressed in my final year in university and, eight years later, it remains a show I watch when I need laughter to alleviate the darkness of the world to remind myself of joy and where it lies: within our connections.In season two, episode five, Schmidt buys Nick a cookie. He saw it and thought of him. The emotionally reticent Nick is uncomfortable with the display of tenderness and, throughout the episode, agonises over how to reciprocate. Eventually he settles on returning the favour, verbalising his affection the only way he knows how: like a Neanderthal. “Gave me cookie, got you cookie. You gave me cookie, got you cookie! Gave me cookie, got you cookie, man!” In my language that means: “I love you and I’m here for you” and I think that’s beautiful. New Girl remains a reminder that hope and joy finds a home in love and its expression. Bolu BabalolaFrom the moment that cheesy theme tune kicks in, I feel at home. Perhaps it is because I mainlined the series while suffering from extreme exam-related anxiety at university, but The West Wing will always be my happy place. Its depiction of late-90s Clintonian politics may seem increasingly dated, yet in the creation of a group of well-meaning, if flawed, politicos, Aaron Sorkin solidified for many the way politics should be done.From Rob Lowe’s puppyish Sam Seaborn, to the gruff but ultimately warm-hearted Toby Ziegler (a pitch-perfect role for Richard Schiff), every West Winger has something about them to love (except Mandy nobody liked Mandy she was swiftly disappeared at the end of season one). Watching Alison Janney’s bizarre performance of the Jekyll never fails to bring a smile to my face – and there is a simple joy to those first four seasons of Sorkin dialogue at its best. The walk-and-talks are the stuff of legend, and the rapid-fire, flirty banter between Josh Lyman and his secretary Donna (this was of course pre-#MeToo) are reminiscent of the best black-and-white screwball comedies.There is even a quarantine lockdown episode – No Exit, in season five – but perhaps that’s too close to home just now. Instead, I can revel in that opening episode as the word “Potus” rings around my head, or Martin Sheen’s Latin excoriation of God in the season two finale, Two Cathedrals. I might be stuck inside, and Donald Trump might be terrorising the White House out there, but I can always depend on President Bartlet. Toby MosesComfort television suggests something warm and swaddling, but one of my go-to watches when I need a shot-in-the-arm is the extended, penultimate episode of the final series of The Thick of It. It is an episode that mirrored and coincided with the real-life Leveson inquiry and its themes, but also brings to mind Chilcot.Laughing obviously makes one feel better and The Thick of It is hilarious, but it is not just that. Seeing intelligence, creative competence, incredible art – if that does not sound too pretentious – is also immensely cheering. Whether it is the brilliant lines we came to expect – “I’m just a lad from Leeds with a lust for life” “If you make eye contact with Malcolm Tucker, you have spilled his pint” “He was only homeless in the sense that he didn’t have a home” – seeing the regulars at the very top of their game, or the sublimely handled mix of tone, it is an hour of perfect television.Some insist that the early New Labour focus of TTOI was superior, but this episode does not merely induce pleasure in its one liners but in its depth and resolve the quiet, oblivious truth-telling by the much put-upon Robyn, and the exquisite Peter Capaldi with his Rachel Dolezal-esque facial expression when everything comes crashing down. But his final bravura speech is arrow-accurate by the writers. These days it is hard not to shove one’s fist into one’s mouth every time someone on Twitter grabs a clip of modern-day politics and makes the same joke: “Missed this episode of The Thick of It!!!!” But even that cannot stop the boost this hour gives me. Hannah Jane ParkinsonI very, very rarely rewatch drama at least not without a very big gap in between. Comedy, however, I can and do watch and rewatch, virtually on a loop. It might be Silicon Valley, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Cheers, and for most of the 90s it was of course Friends (when it was not Will \u0026amp Grace) but most often these days it is Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Tina Fey’s first post-30 Rock venture and arguably her masterwork.It has everything that normally makes rewatching a comedy worthwhile, turned up to 11. The jokes are not just plentiful but fast and might be pulled from any genre at any moment. Daft puns, slapstick, callbacks, character jokes, topical gags, broadbrush generic or tiny little things that depend on a Spelunker-level knowledge of the nichest of niche pop-culture references. And then there’s all of Tituss.The inidual and ensemble playing is endlessly watchable, awe-inspiring and prompts an urge to dissect it, even as such a project will and should for ever elude you. Had you world enough (and time) could you ever teach anyone else to hit the beats like Jane Krakowski does so perfectly and seemingly effortlessly? And finally there is the sheer oddity of the thing. From the premise – 30-year-old woman emerges into the world after 15 years held in a bunker by her kidnapper the Rev Richard Wayne Gary Wayne – to the collection of eclectic characters. But it does, harnessing a series of idiosyncrasies to a singular, ridiculous vision and going all in on it. Utter mastery. Utter joy. Lucy ManganYou know you have watched a lot of Law \u0026amp Order: Special Victims Unit when you can recite the opening narration (“In the criminal justice system, sexually based offences are considered especially heinous …”) with the same ease as an NYPD cop reading a perp his rights. And there is a lot of SVU to watch. There have been 21 seasons and nearly 500 episodes since 1999, when Law \u0026amp Order franchise supremo Dick Wolf first debuted this particularly moreish combo of police procedural and courtroom drama. The choicest rewatch cuts, however, are found between season two – when Munch (Homicide: Life on the Street transfer, Richard Belzer) was partnered with Tutuola (Ice-T) – and the season 12 departure of the lead detective, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni).Dogged devotion to TV formula is what Law \u0026amp Order does best, but those “ripped from the headlines” plots also keep things fresh over repeated viewings, while squad room chats on issues such as consent and gender identity provide fascinating snapshots of changing social attitudes. Like the man says, these offences are “especially heinous”, but there is something both cathartic and comforting about watching Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and her team put away all manner of unsavoury iniduals.The abundance of available reruns also makes it enjoyably easy to forget which you have seen and which you have not. Do I instinctively know that the friendly-seeming schoolteacher is lying about his whereabouts because I half-remember how this one ends? Or has Law \u0026amp Order: SVU transformed me into a damn fine detective at last? Ellen E JonesIf you really put your mind to it, you can get through Spaced in a single day, horsing through its two short seasons on DVD or All 4 in under seven hours. (“Skip to the end!” as Simon Pegg’s rudderless skater-boi Tim might put it.) At various times in the two decades since it debuted, that is exactly what I have done, hunkering down with Jaffa Cakes and other indulgent supplies for a concentrated blast of heightened daftness. Each time, it still manages to feel fresh.Has any other sitcom arrived so fully formed from the outset? With their slacker tale of slapdash flat-sharing – a relatable milieu of sloppy hoodies, Rizlas and PlayStation – writers and stars Jessica Hynes (then Stevenson) and Pegg produced writing as deft and dense as The Simpsons. Their cleverly nested verbal gags and unparalleled physical mugging were further enhanced by the director Edgar Wright’s lickety-split aesthetic: a reaction shot unexpectedly framed through a girl power V-sign still triggers a giggling fit.And even after you have parsed the cascade of pop-culture references, catalogued each cameo by future Britcom luminaries and fully internalised the David HolmesColdcutPrefab Sprout soundtrack, what you are left with is the sheer pleasure of hanging out with characters who feel like real people, with all the shared in-jokes and tolerated failings that signal true friendship. It used to be a nostalgic portal back to my time-wasting 20s. Now Spaced’s chaotic tale of found-family solidarity offers genuine solace. Graeme VirtueFor someone who watches a lot of television (back off, it’s my job), I find it hard to rewatch many shows. There is so much that is new and worthy of our attention that going back to old, familiar ground often feels like a waste of time. There are a couple of exceptions, however, the greatest of which is Buffy, which has taken on a therapeutic role in my life.Many, many years ago, after a breakup, I measured the duration of my sadness by how long it took me to rewatch all seven seasons in their entirety. By the time Buffy was over, so was the heartbreak. Now, I dip in and out of my favourite episodes, but some – Hush, The Wish, The Body, Once More With Feeling, Who Are You? and Restless, to be precise – are frequently revisited. The sound of the theme music alone is the equivalent of a hot bath in mood lighting.There is something particularly soothing about its ultimate moral simplicity. People are flawed (and flayed), they make mistakes, and they learn how to be better. Buffy is the Chosen One, and she has to face her toughest challenges alone, but the biggest, most world-threatening villains require collective action. They need a whole graduation class’s worth of students to destroy a big snakey mayor, the support of one’s friends to combat a secret military base filled with monsters, a whole army of new slayers to battle the First. Now, more than ever, that feels like a message to take comfort from, from the comfort of indoors. Rebecca NicholsonRewatching TV shows, especially at a time of massive global crisis, sounds like a genuinely lovely idea that will doubtless bring a warm feeling of comfort and joy to many people’s lives. Except, I won’t be one of them. The thought of a repeat viewing with shows I love and which have serious rewatch potential – Arrested Development or The Office – fills me with dread. That is even true of rewatching a casual, noncommittal episode (something I only ever allow myself to do “for work”).But outside of that: absolutely not. Never. Ever. The feeling of shame, of drowning in 10,000 other, newer shows begins to set in within milliseconds. “Why haven’t you finished Cheer yet?” my brain says. What about Schitt’s Creek? Sure, you don’t know anyone who actually watches it and you have no idea what it’s about, but people are always talking about it on Twitter aren’t they? What about the new series of This Country, or Shrill, or literally anything else that you’ve not already seen? And that’s before you even get to the classics. What about Breaking Bad, that show you watched one series of and never thought about ever again? Maybe now’s the time to get really, really into that like everyone else did 10 years ago. Or Game of Thrones: that was a bit of a big deal, maybe you ought to finish that one?The whole thing is just another source of anxiety, to be honest, which is a shame because I would love to watch The Office Christmas specials guilt-free. Just once, ideally this summer, while all my other plans are off.

His look became something of a national joke as fashions changed and Wyngarde’s star wane. Mike Myers has said King was an inspiration for Austin Powers.Wyngarde died in 2018 aged approximately 90 – his life story is shrouded in mystery – and more than 250 items are being auctioned online by East Bristol Auctions.A number of vintage scarves that Wyngarde wore as King are on offer on Thursday, as were plenty of sunglasses and a pair of cowboy boots crafted by the century-old Mallorcan company Tony Mora.An original vintage Medico Medalist smoking tobacco pipe, which the catalogue says is “very likely a prop that Wyngarde used”, is also up for grabs. A signed photo from Vivien Leigh is going under the hammer as is a costume necklace he wore in The Lenny Henry Show blaxploitation movie sketch Nathan Gunn in the 1990s.He also gathered some rare Beatles memorabilia, including an original poster from the band’s Abergavenny Town Hall Ballroom performance in 1963.Another intriguing item is described as “an incredible set of believed unheard Robin Gibb song lyrics, presumed to have been written for actor Peter Wyngarde”.The song in question, I Will Surrender, comes with the note: “Words and music by Robin Gibb, 1970.” Wyngarde went on to play the chief of the secret police, Klytus, in the 1980 movie Flash Gordon and the silk neck scarf he wore at the New York premiere is up for sale as is a guitar apparently signed by Freddie Mercury, whose band, Queen, performed the film’s title track.By time he appeared in Flash Gordon, Wyngarde had been through difficult times.In 1975, he was found guilty of gross indecency in a bus station toilet. Newspapers reported that he was summoned under his real name of Cyril Louis Goldbert. A tabloid later reported that his mop of hair was thinning and covered in a flat cap.Poignantly an “original vintage Ray Marston Wig Studio-made wigtoupee” is on sale. The catalogue adds: “The toupee of usual form, with a fine mesh base. Supplied within its original box, addressed to Wyngarde at his personal residence. A rare item from the Peter Wyngarde estate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a62889d8e84ed1f44a195a5e2e2abe350737c70/0_31_2125_1275/master/2125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b308ac851bd916a8c9473d0a0ec7d3f","title":"lockdown tv which show would you like to rewatch with us","story":"As the coronavirus pandemic stops us from enjoying our favourites with our friends and family, come watch a classic from the BBC, ITV or Channel 4 with usLong gone are the days when the idiot box was seen as a solitary activity that rots your brain.

What are the risks of handling packages and groceries?More people are staying indoors to avoid contact with people potentially infected by Covid-19. But in light of a recent report from the US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that said RNA from the virus that causes Covid-19 was found in the Princess Cruise ship 17 days after its passengers had left, what are the risks of handling packages, groceries and what scientists call “high-touch” surfaces?Dr Julia Marcus: A CDC investigation of the cruise ship found evidence of viral RNA in cabins that hadn’t yet been cleaned. But to be clear, that just means the virus was detectable – not that it was viable or that contact with those services would have been able to infect someone. (Editor’s note: RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries the virus’s genetic information.)Dr Akiko Iwasaki: It just means that there are parts of the virus that still remain. The virus needs many other components to be intact. If you have bits and pieces of RNA, that’s not going to make a virus, you need an entire intact genome. Just because you had a little piece of RNA doesn’t mean that there’s an infection.Marcus: The New England Journal of Medicine just published a study that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting. They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours.But it’s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.Marcus: As far as we know right now, people are much more likely to be infected by close contact with an infected person than by touching a contaminated surface. That said, it’s still important to be conscious of what we’re touching, especially high-touch surfaces, and be careful about cleaning our hands after touching things. For example, public transit or grocery stores and places where there tend to be a lot of people.Marcus: It’s a low risk, but it’s possible that if someone is delivering a package to your house and they are sick, that may be a route for transmission. I would recommend that any time something new comes into your household, be conscious of washing your hands after handling it.Iwasaki: There’s definitely a possibility of contamination, but it’s much more likely that the outer cardboard itself will come into contact with a lot more people than what’s inside. And if it takes days to get to your home, whatever virus that was inside will be deactivated already."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/972abfb8a19a9676d8c118a4f18abe31e5164e31/410_0_5350_3210/master/5350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0192267a079be90a9d363d9eb15a28bc","title":"uk goes into lockdown coronavirus photo essay","story":"With the news that all non-essential businesses must close and that people can no longer congregate in groups,  photographers hit the streets to capture the scenes at a safe distance by Jill Mead,  David Levene,  Sean Smith,  Graeme Robertson,  Murdo MacLeod and  Christopher Thomond. Production by  Matt FidlerFrom the south London streets of Southwark, Crouch End in the north, and around the City and West End, to Ramsbottom in Greater Manchester, the Forth Bridge and central Glasgow, the story was a similiar one. An eerily beautiful sunny day, quiet on the streets, with people not really sure how to pass the time.The day started with images on social media of busy underground trains as the reduced service resulted in a familiar crowding of the carriages, but this was not a normal day in the capital. Non-essential shops were closed, but the list of key workers is long, and London appeared overwhelmingly quiet on the deserted streets of Waterloo that David Levene photographed early in the day.Jill Mead discovered her local street market was busy in Southwark. The combination of spring weather, worries about supplies and unease about the government lockdown made for a strange atmosphere.Graeme Robertson found people observing physical distancing rules in the parks of north London in Highgate, masks and hats in Crouch End – and stillness on the quiet suburban streets of Archway.Sean Smith found a rather deserted square mile area, with a lone Domino’s Pizza delivery rider, before heading to the West End, where he came across the last performance artist working in Leicester Square – and met a tourist who had just arrived from Mexico and was trying to get to Germany.A woman taking the sunshine on a balcony, an ambulance passing through the streets – these were the sights of Ramsbottom in Manchester, where Christopher Thomond spent the day.Murdo MacLeod found the rush-hour traffic much thinner than the usual gridlock after the government’s lockdown in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The city centre of Glasgow was quiet, with shops and cafes all closed – and the railway station was deserted.Ryan Bowman is the proprietor of Mezcal Mexican restaurant.

Seventy thousand of the claims were from those asking for an advance, suggesting people began to struggle with money as soon the virus began to spread more widely.“We made a decision that managing claims and making payments is a number one priority for DWP. Operationally we can deprioritise other things,” he said.Disability benefits will no longer be assessed in job centres, ending face-to-face assessments which he said meant they are “extending existing awards” and no longer re-assessing personal independence payment claimants.The department has so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with the sharp rise in universal credit claims, and is to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.Within weeks 10,000 employees working in functional jobs such as finance and on longer-term programmes within the department will be brought into the universal credit team.Schofield said: “The first people will start arriving in London job centres today from corporate centre type roles across DWP.”He claimed the online system to apply for the benefit was so far working well but admitted there had been problems with the online verification stage.“It’s still too early days to know whether people are getting through those in the time that I would expect them to. I suspect there are more people so far who are finding verification is holding them up,” he said.Asked by committee chair, Labour MP Stephen Timms, if it was acceptable to tell the half a million people who applied for universal credit that they will have to wait five weeks for their first regular benefit payment.Coffey said: “Advances can be made to people pretty quickly.”She said they will be “sticking with” the advance system and technically it is difficult to make changes to universal credit structure that people have been asking for.Turning the advance into a non-repayable grant, as has been suggested by some MPs, is “operationally not feasible” in the short-term, she said.She was backed by Schofield, who said the department would stick with the existing policies and frameworks relating to the benefits system so it kept functioning.Of the 230,000 people who applied for universal credit last week, 70,000 asked for an advance to deal with immediate cashflow problems, which Timms suggested put them into debt to the DWP at the start of the coronavirus crisis.Coffey said: “I don’t see it as being in debt. I see it as about spreading effectively an annual payment into 13 payments, rather than 12. Then people can chose early on what level of advance they get.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0161bbba05de1f9db2321260d44ed7b1a89d18c3/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4f1bb07a5edef0896de0fe29b254f8","title":"are you cohabiting because of coronavirus share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have unexpectedly moved in together due to the coronavirus lockdown, and from partners who’ve had to remain apart As measures to restrict the spread of coronavirus force people to stay at home, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures.Because of the short notice of the lockdown announcement, others may have had to remain at a house which isn’t their usual home, or with people they don’t usually live with.We’d like to hear from those who’ve unexpectedly moved in together, or those who have decided to remain apart.Are you living with your new in-laws?

The authorities are blind to us,” one resident told the .City of God’s gangsters are not the only outlaws attacking coronavirus in Rio’s densely populated favelas, which are home to about 2 of the city’s 7 million residents.In the Morro dos Prazeres, gang members have told residents only circulate in groups of two while in Rocinha, one of Latin America’s biggest favelas, traffickers have also decreed a curfew.“The gangsters have said that after 8.30pm everybody must stay indoors and if they don’t there will be reprisals,” said a street hawker who lives there. “I’m staying at home – filled with fear and smothered in hand sanitizer,” the man joked.In Santa Marta, a favela that sits in the shadow of Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue, traffickers have been handing out soap and have placed signs near a public water fountain at the community’s entrance that say: “Please wash your hands before entering the favela.”Meanwhile, in some sections of the Complexo da Maré, a sprawling favela near Rio’s international airport, traffickers have told shops and churches to reduce their operating hours.“Only the bakery stays open until later – until 11pm,” said one mother who lives in Parque União, one of 16 communities that make up the Complexo. “Nobody wants to go outside – first of all for fear of coronavirus and now because of this order.”In another of the Complexo’s communities, Nova Holanda, evangelical prayer sessions are now taking place outside the church.“We sing our songs of praise to God from the windows of our homes, at pre-arranged times,” one resident said.Other favelas in which curfews have been imposed include Pavão-Pavãozinho in Copacabana, Cantagalo in Ipanema, and Vidigal, further along the beach past the upper-class neighbourhood of Leblon.Edmund Ruge, a Rio-based editor for the RioOnWatch news site which covers the favelas, said the imposition of curfews in some areas spoke to the Brazilian state’s longstanding neglect of such areas, which often lack even basic sanitation.“Favela activists have been scrambling very effectively” to respond to the impending coronavirus crisis with donation and awareness campaigns across Brazil, Ruge said, pointing to projects such as #COVID19NasFavelas.“It has been really impressive.

The government later took a more cautious line, saying that the tests would not be available so quickly.The UK government has bought 3.5m tests – which reveal whether someone has had the virus and is therefore thought to have some immunity – and is ordering millions more, it has said.At the prime minister’s daily press conference on Wednesday, the government’s medical and scientific advisers said they needed to be certain the tests worked before they could be made available.“The key thing for us to do is evaluate – are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?” said Chris Whitty, chief medical officer. “If they are incredibly accurate, we will work out the quickest way to release them. If they are not accurate, we will not release any of them.”The tests would, he said, “completely transform what we can do” – but were not as important as the antigen tests which are used to diagnose Covid-19 in sick hospital patients.Boris Johnson said they would make the antibody tests available when they could. “We will do it as soon as possible,” he said. “We are massively ramping up our testing programme.”The home test, which looks like a pregnancy test, involves pricking a finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by the device. “Several million tests have been purchased for use. These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do,” Peacock said. “Once they have been tested this week and the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community.”Amazon has agreed to carry out distribution and the tests are also set to go on sale in chemist shops.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.Asked if they would be available in days rather than weeks or months, Peacock said: “Yes, absolutely.” If there was a charge for them, she thought it would be minimal, she added.Widespread availability of a fingerprick test that produces results in 10 to 15 minutes would be a game-changer. NHS doctors and nurses with symptoms would know immediately whether they have had Covid-19, enabling them to get back to work sooner.NHS workers or anyone else would be able to know if they have had the virus and are therefore immune, which means they could resume their normal lives, no longer having to work from home or keep their distance from other people. It is widely thought that having had Covid-19 makes people immune to the disease. There have been cases of apparent reinfection, though they are rare.The test detects the presence of IGM, an antibody that arises very early on in the infection, and IGG, which is increased in the body’s response to the virus. The results of some of the tests on order can be read by anyone, but others would need to be interpreted by healthcare professionals.The UK is not the only country ordering the antibody tests. “Tests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice. We are not alone in doing this,” said Peacock.Amazon had agreed to deliver the home tests, Peacock told the committee. There was no suggestion from her that the Royal Mail might be given the contract.The antibody home tests are part of a programme of increased testing, she said. The number of nasal swab tests, which are currently being used in hospitals to find out whether very sick patients have Covid-19, will be increased within the next couple of days.The government has promised that these tests, for current viral infection, will reach 25,000. Last week, the numbers tested topped 8,000 but since then have fallen to a low of 5,522, recovering yesterday to 6,491.Peacock reiterated that they would get to 25,000 a day. It is understood that a deal has been struck with the pharmaceutical giant Roche to increase the numbers to that level.Peacock said there were also plans to be able to test up to 100,000 key workers a day. “There is urgent work going on,” she said. A test processing centre that has just been opened in Milton Keynes would allow a much bigger laboratory of these standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests. The home-based test kits would be the third plank of the testing programme. The fourth was seroprevalence testing – blood tests to establish how widespread the virus was in the country.A Boots spokesperson said: “We are keen to work with the government to explore opportunities to support Covid-19 testing and to support the NHS in any way we can. However we do not have any type of Covid-19 tests in our stores. Customers should not make a trip to a Boots store or pharmacy for this purpose.”• This article and its headline were amended several hours after publication after the government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, contradicted earlier evidence to a select committee from Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England, about when the tests would be introduced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea22048e02c73a04a9c3f245bce37f204a7fc79/239_0_2886_1731/master/2886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374ca50e6f853a190ac76745c8d7311d","title":"uk government set to pay self employed workers 80 of earnings","story":"Rishi Sunak pressured into measures amid fears coronavirus will trigger unemployment crisisSunak has been under growing pressure to do more for the UK’s 5 million self-employed after announcing an unprecedented job retention scheme for employees last Friday, that will see thousands paid to stay at home.It comes as Covid-19 claimed the life of a 21-year-old woman from Buckinghamshire, according to her family, and Britain’s deputy ambassador to Hungary, who was 37. It was announced on Wednesday night that the number of confirmed UK cases stood at 9,529 people and the death toll had risen by 41 to 463.The prime minister promised on Wednesday that the government was preparing to “put its arms around every worker.” He said the self-employed would be offered “parity” with employees – though Whitehall sources cautioned that did not mean the two schemes would be identical.It could be subject to a lower cap than the £2,500 in monthly pre-tax income available in that scheme, however – because the self-employed tend to pay less tax. Some groups, including those already claiming universal credit, could be excluded.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said: “I genuinely don’t think there’s been a time in our history in the last century, certainly, when the government of this country has put its arms around so many people to get us through a very tough time. We will get through it, and we will get through it together.”Sunak significantly increased the generosity of universal credit as part of last week’s package, and made it available to more self-employed workers.A sharp surge in claims for universal credit has underlined the severe economic toll the coronavirus is already taking on Britain’s workforce.The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, revealed on Wednesday that 477,000 people had applied for the benefit in the past nine days. That is more than during any entire month of the 2008-09 financial crisis.“We don’t know if they’re self-employed or at different stages, and I want to assure people that help, even if it’s not currently the level of help they would like, is there to help them through the safety net of the welfare state,” she said.Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The unprecedented surge in new universal credit claims shows that the UK is already in the midst of an unemployment crisis. The increase in claims is putting huge pressure on our social security system, and is driven by a huge hit to family incomes.“The government was right to increase the generosity of the benefits system last week. It now needs to ensure the resources are there so that claims are processed quickly, and people receive support as soon as possible.”The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is redeploying 10,000 staff to help process the extraordinary upsurge in new applications, making it the department’s main focus in the weeks ahead.Its permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, said: “We made a decision that managing claims and making payments is a number one priority for DWP. Operationally we can deprioritise other things.”The department has so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with the sharp rise in universal credit claims, and is to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who will return to the backbenches in ten days’ time when a new Labour leader takes over, used what is likely to be one of his final speeches from the frontbench to call for the government to announce details of its scheme for supporting self-employed workers urgently.“If people claim fraudulently while still working, they will rightly be prosecuted. But right now millions of cabbies, childminders, plumbers, electricians, painters and decorators and actors have all lost work or closed down their businesses. As have builders, designated as the self-employed under the construction industry scheme and they have no income. They need a solution, now,” he said.Meanwhile businesses continued to demand clarity about who can keep travelling to work, as firms called for workers to come in despite Monday’s plea by the prime minister for the nation to “stay at home”.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, tweeted: “It’s clear that many firms do not know whether to stay open or to close.” She said she would meet the business secretary and request better guidance.The warnings come amid widespread confusion among businesses about how to respond to the lockdown. Halfords, the car parts, bike and servicing group, is reopening some of its stores this week after being designated an essential service. It had closed its shops on Monday night as Johnson addressed the nation.Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct retail chain had intended to remain open but was forced to backtrack after a public outcry.Frances O’Grady, the director general of the TUC, said the government needed to crack down on non-essential companies making staff attend work, telling ministers they needed to directly intervene if employers flouted the rules.“Companies like Sports Direct shouldn’t be putting their profits before people’s lives. No one in non-essential services should be forced to go to work. And no one should be sacked for following official instructions and staying home,” she said.Off-licences and other shops licensed to sell alcohol are now allowed to stay open, after an 11th-hour change, while several companies are lobbying ministers to be allowed special treatment.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called for tough enforcement action against companies forcing their staff to travel to work in non-essential jobs during the lockdown.“This is wrong. It’s risking the health of workers, their families and wider society. In the absence of a clear government instruction to end non-essential work I am taking legal advice about whether Greater Manchester police or other agencies can take enforcement action against companies which are exposing their employees in this way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2868c179bed9494063e35dd8e4f2c970e9e9295a/0_116_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35ebb1242ef040fb6778c1934c506cf4","title":"ardern thanks nation as new zealand adjusts to new normal of covid 19 lockdown","story":"Country of five million has 283 cases of coronavirus but Jacinda Ardern warns that may grow to thousands during month-long restrictionsThe sound of day one of New Zealand’s nationwide lockdown was birdcall. Wood pigeons, tui and saddleback woke to quiet cities and towns, where their songs became the soundtrack to the shutdown.Many Kiwis rose late on Thursday, having no work or school to attend, and nothing to do beyond the prime minister’s instructions to “save lives by staying home”.In Auckland, usually clogged highways were miraculously empty, and the police commissioner Mike Bush said besides a few stragglers needing “education” on the rules, Kiwis had been compliant with the new measures, which prohibit anyone from leaving their homes except for essential supplies or a brief respite of exercise, taken locally.Billboards on state highways flashed out public health warnings, Kiwi-style: “Be kind, stay calm”.In Wellington, parliament had been abandoned, and the last glimpse of prime minister Jacinda Ardern before lockdown was through an impromptu Facebook live video, recorded from her couch in a tracksuit after putting toddler Neve to bed.Down south, hundreds waited in Picton to board the inter-islander ferry, which had 2,500 passengers to move before all domestic travel is stopped on Friday. For many, it is a race against the clock – if they don’t make it home they’ll be stuck for a month or even more.On the west coast of the South Island, locals are used to isolation, and looking after each other is second nature in a region that is the least populated in the country, and prone to getting cut off due to floods or landslips.Lewis Holland, owner of the Ngakawau Store in Hector, a village of just a few dozen people at the top of the South Island, said his tiny grocery was more of a community service than a traditional shop, and has been classified an essential service by the government, allowing it to stay open.“Some of the elderly people will call us and we’ll make up their order. And when they come around we can just put it in their back seat and you know, sort out the payment later,” Holland told the local paper.In Dunedin, on the south-east coast of the South Island, many took to the town’s parks as the crisp Autumn day rose. One woman started a lonesome round of golf on the empty rugby fields of Unity Park, while an old man sat alone on a park bench, staring at the harbour, and waving to strangers in the distance.As lockdown settled in, the number of cases rose, with director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, saying more sick people were to be expected for at least the next ten days. After that, authorities would be able to assess if lockdown measures were working. By then, if Kiwis followed the rules, cases should begin to decline.There are now 283 confirmed and probable cases of the virus, Bloomfield said, and seven people in hospital, though none in intensive care. Despite few flights still operating, hundreds of people continue to arrive into Auckland’s international airport, and anyone without convincing self-isolation plans is being escorted by police to nearby hotels and motels for enforced quarantine. Around half of the new arrivals had not made adequate plans, police commissioner Mike Bush said.In Christchurch, a hub for tourist arrivals, vast parks full of campervans have been set up for tourists to self-isolate if they have made no other arrangements. Campervans are still permitted, but anyone travelling in one must drive it directly to one location, and lockdown there for the coming month – an unwelcome prospect as the temperature plummets, and the days grow shorter. Kiwis have taken many travellers in, after appeals for help and accomodation on social media.In the hours before the lockdown took effect, a number of couples rushed to the altar, unwilling to brave this strange and unprecedented period as merely betrothed.In Manawatū a couple who were supposed to be married before 120 people on Saturday instead tied the knot with six witnesses on Wednesday night.“For us, we’re Christians, it’s not about the glamour of the day, it’s about the commitment,” groom Scott Nicholls told the Manuwatū Standard.“We’re committed to this for the rest of our lives.”Panic-buying continues at pharmacies and supermarkets, with the director-general of health ordering prescription limits after medicines were stockpiled. Countdown supermarket has boosted its delivery capabilities, and introduced exclusive shopping hours for emergency and frontline workers.Speaking to the nation on Thursday afternoon, prime minister Ardern said New Zealanders needed to continue to practice kindness, even as the realities of “our new normal” began to bite.“On Monday we said we needed to shut New Zealand down. And here we are on Thursday with our streets essentially empty,” Ardern said.“That is a remarkable feat and I want to thank the nation for that.”Ardern’s traditional opponent, National party leader Simon Bridges, seemed to have heeded her message of kindness, announcing that he would open up his Facebook messenger so anyone in New Zealand could ask him and his team for help – be it groceries, a chat or financial advice and support.Many took to social media to document their first day of lockdown, which for many involved DIY projects, home-schooling children, new recipes or large stacks of books to read.But as in any crisis, the small, island country is quickly banding together, buoyed by the calm pragmatism of their leader.And one phrase is uniting the nation as they quietly surge ahead, ided but together.“Kia kaha,” (“stay strong”) people text each other, or write in chalk on deserted pavements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004a9b75f8d34e820db08905e864dcf769a192d1/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e28190dab872463d8f7dd0e1fd421cb7","title":"australian prime minister to ask global leaders to fund urgent research for coronavirus vaccine","story":"Scott Morrison will also urge G20 leaders to keep borders open for trade of crucial medical supplies during Covid-19 pandemic • Follow our latest Australia coronavirus blog for live news and updatesScott Morrison will urge G20 leaders to fund rapid research to develop a coronavirus vaccine and support trials of anti-viral drugs, while keeping borders open to ensure critical medical supplies can be traded during the crisis.With 80 countries seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund to manage the economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and with G20 finance ministers predicting a global economic downturn, Australia’s prime minister will use a teleconference of world leaders scheduled for late Thursday night to call on rich countries to support the developing world to help lower the death count in countries with poor health systems, and also minimise the risk of failed states.Morrison will say Australia intends to assist the Pacific as much as possible during the pandemic.The G20 hookup comes as the Morrison government is working up a third round of safety net measures on the assumption that swathes of the economy will move into a period of suspended animation as lockdowns take effect. Conceptually, the government wants to ensure that businesses emerge on the other side of the pandemic without substantial liabilities on their books that would force them to either declare bankruptcy or sack substantial numbers of workers.Morrison will also meet the premiers on Friday at the national cabinet. New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT have signalled they will move to stage 3 lockdowns over the coming days in an effort to contain community transmission, and Friday’s meeting will consider specific trigger points for that decision.With the number of reported coronavirus cases in Australia creeping towards 3,000, governments are keeping a close watch on the number of infections that are locally acquired with no known link to a confirmed case. Official data seen by  Australia indicates there were 115 cases in that category on Thursday, with a further 432 cases under investigation.As of Thursday night, it appeared unlikely that stage 3 lockdowns would be imposed in the most populous states before the weekend, and the Morrison government wants to stretch the time before that happens as long as possible. Data collected by the government through the Citymapper app points to a substantial drop off in movement around cities since the government closed the border, and restrictions on crowds were imposed in mid-March.As well as establishing the trigger points for the next sequence of lockdowns, Friday’s meeting will also consider as yet uncompleted work on financial assistance measures for renters and landlords. The nuts and bolts of that package are being worked up by treasurers, with the states responsible for residential tenancies and the commonwealth dealing with commercial landlords and renters.The states are looking to ensure that residential tenants don’t get evicted over the coming months if they cannot pay their rent and will propose options to ensure there are no rent increases during the crisis.The Morrison government wants the states to offer land tax relief for landlords, but is unlikely to get the states on board. The commonwealth is considering tax relief for landlords prepared to either cut rent or provide rent holidays for their tenants.The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is also prevailing on the banks to help carry the load of suspended rental income for the duration of the crisis. The insurance industry has also been in talks with the Morrison government over the rent package.It is believed insurers are concerned they may be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in payments under landlord insurance policies. The insurance covers landlords for a variety of problems, including non-payment of rent. It is believed most policies do not exclude non-payment caused by a pandemic.“The insurance industry is aware of discussions around the impact of Covid-19 on commercial and domestic rents and is talking to government about the issue,” an Insurance Council of Australia spokesman said.Also on the agenda for Friday’s national cabinet meeting is a conversation about reducing the amount of elective dental surgery to free up protective equipment. There will also be another conversation about schools in an effort to land on a national position.Morrison held talks with education unions this week and is attempting to broker arrangements where schools around the country move to provide distance learning by term two but campuses remain open for students who need to attend because their parents are essential services workers, or because they are in disadvantaged households.With the economy already profoundly disrupted by the pandemic, business and unions are attempting to recalibrate industrial arrangements. On Thursday, two peak employer groups struck a deal with the Australian Services Union to vary the clerks award in a bid to keep hundreds of thousands in work by improving flexibility.The deal, struck with the Australian Industry Group and Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, allows employees and employers to change the ordinary hours of work to better allow working from home. It also gives more power for employers to direct employees to take annual leave and more options for longer periods of leave at reduced pay to manage the downturn.Pressure from peak business groups to adopt some form of wage subsidy to keep workers in employment on top of grants of up to $25,000 continued to grow on Thursday.The government is examining wage subsidies for the third round of stimulus but is reluctant to adopt income support that gives more assistance to higher income earners than workers on average incomes or minimum wages. It also wants to deliver support through the existing tax and transfer system.The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government had not adopted a wage guarantee because “the advice in front of us was that that was not the best way in an Australian context” to provide support, because “the existing jobseeker payment framework” – unemployment benefits – would reach households faster.The government is yet to respond to Labor’s call to change the income threshold and taper rates for unemployment benefits so more families are able to access jobseeker payments where one partner is jobless but the other earns more than $48,000.Options are still being developed by the social services minister, Anne Ruston, and the government characterises an agreement between the prime minister and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as a commitment only to consider changes with a view to expanding eligibility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d28c02e8de261960986f6c18350b58cfb7f854/0_0_4812_2886/master/4812.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=879fd6238a536d8fa289ebab728ada00","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are should i call a doctor uk","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor in the UK?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 7,500 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 114,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves.

Some of the earliest postcards sent in Britain depicted its broad promenades and resplendent gardens. The politan Board of Works, which oversaw its construction, hailed it as an “appropriate, and appropriately civilised, cityscape for a prosperous commercial society”.From the Athens plague in 430BC, which drove profound changes in the city’s laws and identity, to the Black Death in the Middle Ages, which transformed the balance of class power in European societies, to the recent spate of Ebola epidemics across sub-Saharan Africa that illuminated the growing interconnectedness of today’s hyper-globalised cities, public health crises rarely fail to leave their mark on a metropolis.As the world continues to fight the rapid spread of coronavirus, confining many people to their homes and radically altering the way we move through, work in and think about our cities, some are wondering which of these adjustments will endure beyond the end of the pandemic, and what life might look like on the other side.One of the most pressing questions that urban planners will face is the apparent tension between densification – the push towards cities becoming more concentrated, which is seen as essential to improving environmental sustainability – and disaggregation, the separating out of populations, which is one of the key tools currently being used to hold back infection transmission.“At the moment we are reducing density everywhere we can, and for good reason,” observes Richard Sennett, a professor of urban studies at MIT and senior adviser to the UN on its climate change and cities programme. “But on the whole density is a good thing: denser cities are more energy efficient. So I think in the long term there is going to be a conflict between the competing demands of public health and the climate.”Sennett believes that in the future there will be a renewed focus on finding design solutions for inidual buildings and wider neighbourhoods that enable people to socialise without being packed “sardine-like” into compressed restaurants, bars and clubs – although, given the incredibly high cost of land in big cities like New York and Hong Kong, success here may depend on significant economic reforms as well.In recent years, although cities in the global south are continuing to grow as a result of inward rural migration, northern cities are trending in the opposite direction, with more affluent residents taking advantage of remote working capabilities and moving to smaller towns and countryside settlements offering cheaper property and a higher quality of life.The “declining cost of distance”, as Karen Harris, the managing director of Bain consultancy’s Macro Trends Group, calls it, is likely to accelerate as a result of the coronavirus crisis. More companies are establishing systems that enable staff to work from home, and more workers are getting accustomed to it. “These are habits that are likely to persist,” Harris says.The implications for big cities are immense. If proximity to one’s job is no longer a significant factor in deciding where to live, for example, then the appeal of the suburbs wanes we could be heading towards a world in which existing city centres and far-flung “new villages” rise in prominence, while traditional commuter belts fade away.Another potential impact of coronavirus may be an intensification of digital infrastructure in our cities. South Korea, one of the countries worst-affected by the disease, has also posted some of the lowest mortality rates, an achievement that can be traced in part to a series of technological innovations – including, controversially, the mapping and publication of infected patients’ movements.In China, authorities have enlisted the help of tech firms such as Alibaba and Tencent to track the spread of Covid-19 and are using “big data” analysis to anticipate where transmission clusters will emerge next. If one of the government takeaways from coronavirus is that “smart cities” including Songdo or Shenzhen are safer cities from a public health perspective, then we can expect greater efforts to digitally capture and record our behaviour in urban areas – and fiercer debates over the power such surveillance hands to corporations and states.Indeed, the spectre of creeping authoritarianism – as emergency disaster measures become normalised, or even permanent – should be at the forefront of our minds, says Sennett. “If you go back through history and look at the regulations brought in to control cities at times of crisis, from the French revolution to 911 in the US, many of them took years or even centuries to unravel,” he says.At a time of heightened ethnonationalism on the global stage, in which rightwing populists have assumed elected office in many countries from Brazil to the US, Hungary and India, one consequence of coronavirus could be an entrenchment of exclusionary political narratives, calling for new borders to be placed around urban communities – overseen by leaders who have the legal and technological capacity, and the political will, to build them.In the past, after a widespread medical emergency, Jewish communities and other socially stigmatised groups such as those affected by leprosy have borne the brunt of public anger. References to the “China virus” by Donald Trump suggest such grim scapegoating is likely to be a feature of this pandemic’s aftermath as well.On the ground, however, the story of coronavirus in many global cities has so far been very different. After decades of increasing atomisation, particularly among younger urban residents for whom the impossible cost of housing has made life both precarious and transient, the sudden proliferation of mutual aid groups – designed to provide community support for the most vulnerable during isolation – has brought neighbours together across age groups and demographic ides. Social distancing has, ironically, drawn some of us closer than ever before. Whether such groups survive beyond the end of coronavirus to have a meaningful impact on our urban future depends, in part, on what sort of political lessons we learn from the crisis.The vulnerability of many fellow city dwellers – not just because of a temporary medical emergency but as an ongoing lived reality – has been thrown into sharp relief, from elderly people lacking sufficient social care to the low-paid and self-employed who have no financial buffer to fall back on, but upon whose work we all rely.A stronger sense of society as a collective whole, rather than an agglomeration of fragmented iniduals, could lead to a long-term increase in public demands for more interventionist measures to protect citizens – a development that governments may find harder to resist given their readiness in the midst of coronavirus to override the primacy of markets.Private hospitals are already facing pressure to open up their beds without extra charge for those in need in Los Angeles, homeless citizens have seized vacant homes, drawing support from some lawmakers. Will these kinds of sentiments dwindle with the passing of coronavirus, or will political support for urban policies that put community interests ahead of corporate ones – like a greater imposition of rent controls – endure?We don’t yet know the answer, but in the new and unpredictable connections swiftly being forged within our cities as a result of the pandemic, there is perhaps some cause for optimism. “You can’t ‘unknow’ people,” observes Harris, “and usually that’s a good thing.” Sennett thinks we are potentially seeing a fundamental shift in urban social relations. “City residents are becoming aware of desires that they didn’t realise they had before,” he says, “which is for more human contact, for links to people who are unlike themselves.” Whether that change in the nature of city living proves to be as lasting as Bazalgette’s sewer-pipe embankment remains, for now, to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97dd6b97b5891d9972b372af146d849ea5e2f3e8/0_95_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=985f4c46b98ab40cfc0f8cd47bac058b","title":"new zealand in lockdown a surreal experience when you cant see the enemy","story":"In Wellington it felt downright bizarre as people took exaggerated arcs on the footpath to avoid each other, while near-empty buses sped past By the time they locked down Italy, it seemed like it was already too late. Hundreds of people there had died of Covid-19 , with thousands infected. Over the next two weeks, the death toll soared. In New Zealand, we have oddly been in the opposite position: no one has died from the virus. Seven people are in hospital but they’re not in intensive care or on ventilators. There are more than 280 people confirmed to have the disease.Yet this country has begun at least four weeks of some of the strictest restrictions anywhere in the world to fight Covid-19, clamping down on most movement, association and – to the chagrin of some – shopping, in the hope that a tragedy like the one unfolding in Italy and elsewhere can be avoided. There wasn’t time to finesse plans – to ensure everything was perfect – before the rules came into effect, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, told us on Wednesday. We were just going to essentially give it a punt. It’s the kind of scenario in which New Zealanders tend to perform best.In the capital, Wellington, where I live, during the hours before the restrictions came into force, the sky was blue and the breeze gentle. We had dinner as usual (takeaways – because who knows when we’ll next have those?). Children played on a driveway up the street. Only the teeth-clenching sound of an alert blaring from our phones thanks to Civil Defence officials, reminding us of the impending lockdown – and providing a hefty shot of adrenaline to anyone who wasn’t already on edge – reiterated what was about to happen.It was faintly surreal to prepare to hunker down without having seen the enemy yet. Most New Zealanders don’t have Covid-19.Most New Zealanders don’t know anyone who has Covid-19. They don’t know anyone who knows anyone who has Covid-19For most of us the spread of the virus so far had been a matter of inconvenience. Life was close to normal. At the weekend, I was briefly stymied to learn I could not take the kids to the museum, so we took them on a bush walk instead. We still went to swimming lessons, a cafe for brunch. We took precautions, but when we ambled into supermarkets for late-night cheese purchases, queues were not long and the essentials (cheese) were still available.In other nations the dismantling of public life did not come as a surprise when it happened – things felt bad already in many cases. But for New Zealand in peacetime it felt downright bizarre.On Wednesday night, people out walking – the single approved outdoor pastime, beyond shopping for groceries and seeking medical help – took exaggerated arcs on the footpath to avoid each other, and near-empty buses sped past like limousines ferrying just one or two people each. At first I wondered if life would change for me after the new measures began. I am an introvert and long walks are already my favourite hobby. I constantly promise to see my friends and then never actually see them. It’s been years since I darkened the doors of a nightclub. And unlike my husband, who could not do his job from home on Monday and sat on the couch eating creme eggs, which he is allergic to, I have worked at our house for four years and am used to the mental pitfalls.But then I think about dinner out for my birthday next week, getting a coffee at the corner cafe, the playgrounds, the pools, board games with friends, seeing their babies, the library, getting ice creams with the kids. I thought I was a homebody but I’d bargained without all of these little measures that we spool out through our day or week or month to feel and be part of things.When I was involved in covering the Christchurch terrorist attack last March, I wondered if our relaxed way of life would change as a result of what had happened. And for a tiny while, it seemed there was a tension in the streets, armed police everywhere. But eventually life just sort of went back to normal, at least in public. New Zealanders pride themselves on that, that nothing – no matter what – changes the “she’ll be right” way in which they’ve become accustomed to living.But Covid-19 has changed that, and very suddenly. Still, the hope is that if everyone plays by the rules, it needn’t change things forever.What we don’t have a sense of yet is what the enduring image of this crisis will be: the line around the block outside an Auckland gun shop – a culture this country has tried to reject after the mass shooting in Christchurch – or the electronic traffic billboards re-purposed with the exhortation to “be kind”. I think we know the country we want to be revealed as, the country we want to be. And when we all emerge blinking into the sunlight after this is over, the best possible scenario would be to find that, in true New Zealand fashion, nothing much has happened at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0889f1e50c1960e94e4fe1a6be779000964d0b79/0_286_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d828df445a2520d8c3be14c75ea7db1","title":"why a pilgrimage was good practice for lockdown","story":"My experience on the Sultan’s trail found that two Christians, two Muslims, a Jew and two atheists could live peaceably together, although the mountain scenery seems a lifetime away nowBack in early autumn I went on a pilgrimage from Belgrade to Istanbul with six others to film a television programme that airs on Friday. At the best of times, the mountains of Bulgaria would feel a lifetime away, but now it all feels so much further.I took part because I enjoy talking about faith, and love walking. Our route was part of the Sultan’s Trail, a long-distance footpath from Vienna to Istanbul. It marks the 16th-century marches taken by Suleiman the Magnificent and his Ottoman armies as they conquered Belgrade and most of Hungary before the Viennese held out against them. The trail is styled the “path of peace”, along which all cultures and religions can come together.Our magnificent seven consisted of two Christians, two Muslims, two atheists and a Jew. The two Christians were me and Fatima Whitbread the Muslims were the broadcasters Mim Shaikh and Amar Latif the atheists were the comedian and writer Dom Joly and the actor Pauline McLynn who was Mrs Doyle in Father Ted and last but not least Edwina Currie, who was raised Orthodox Jewish.Now, seven of us on top of a Bulgarian mountain, Serbian monastery or Turkish mosque, or bunking up in confined spaces between these places, is hardly like the kind of home isolation we are all having to do now.

Photograph: Tauseef MustafaAFP via Getty ImagesPlaying the antibody cardWar on Covid-19 is three-pronged: a longer-term race to produce a vaccine effective in large populations generation of treatments (antivirals) for deployment in the meantime and use of coronavirus antibodies known as immunoglobulins. These are proteins produced by plasma cells in the bloodstream and used by the immune system to neutralise pathogens such as viruses.Presence of antibodies confirms infection, so testing for their presence can be a valuable indication of immunity, especially for those working in healthcare.In addition, antibodies have big potential as a treatment. Like the global race to produce a vaccine, numerous labs are working on developing quick antibody tests, some of which may even be self-testing kits.Meanwhile New York health authorities plan to begin collecting plasma from people who have recovered and inject the antibody-rich fluid into patients still fighting the virus in clinical trials. Known as convalescent plasma, it has been used for centuries, and was deployed during the horrendous flu pandemic of 1918, but not in recent decades.Some experts say the treatment, though somewhat primitive, might be the best hope for combating coronavirus until more sophisticated therapies are developed, which could take months.Infusions of convalescent plasma were associated with milder symptoms and shorter hospital stays for some patients during the 2002 SARS outbreak, and initial reports from China suggest it might also be effective in dulling the effects of Covid-19.The treatment is not without risks. There is danger in giving a patient the wrong type of blood or inadvertently transmitting other pathogens in a transfusion, but safety advances in recent decades have made adverse outcomes rare. Initially, it will be offered to critically ill patients. Once proven to be safe and effective, it’s likely to work best with patients before symptoms become too severe.The US pharmaceutical Regeneron, which has a large “industrial operations and product supply facility” employing 1,000 people in Limerick, has also identified hundreds of antibodies that could treat or prevent coronavirus.It confirmed its “plans to initiate large-scale manufacturing by mid-April with antibody cocktail therapy, with potential to enter human clinical studies by early summer”.“We don’t disclose which products are made where,” a spokeswoman said – though it’s recruiting specialist staff for its Limerick plant. Longer term antibody tests will also help researchers understand how long immunity to the virus lasts a key issue for any future vaccine.The science of physical distancingThe point of the Covid-19 spear looms ever closer. That’s when it will cause its maximum toll – the top of that dreaded cases curve.At this stage of the pandemic with cases jumping daily, physical distancing within the community assumes critical importance hence the new, scaled-up restrictions with a tightening up on that key measure.Obviously, it fits with the strategies of wash your hands self-isolate if showing symptoms, coughsneeze into elbow and “test, test, test”.Transmission route: Physical distancing is required as Covid-19 spreads mainly from person-to-person, i.e.– Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 2 metres)– Through respiratory droplets carried in the air produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Justifying the approach: Physical distancing is not a notional precaution, it’s a scientifically-justified action based on mathematics, understanding of social patterns and medical knowledge (epidemiology). It hinges around determining the r0 (pronounced ‘r-nought’) value of an infectious disease.The r0 for Covid-19 is estimated at 2.5. So a typical person who is infected will spread it to 2.5 - between two and three people – during the period they’re infectious. Without controls, a single case would lead to 1,000 cases after four weeks.The objective is to get that figure down to below one. At that point the disease stops spreading the typical person who is infected isn’t passing on the virus to anyone else before they recover.A complex factoring in to how long the virus remains infectious cultural considerations (extent to which people have physical contact), transmission data and immunitysusceptiblity considerations are all part of the r0 computation.Key actions with Covid-19: All told with this pandemic, ensuring it has less opportunity to spread to other people, by seeing less of them, and by reducing the chance during an interaction that the disease will pass to you – or from you to another person – are critical community actions. That’s what forces the r0 down in this instance. So it’s back to the five-step strategy including physical distancing.The proof: This is where contact tracing comes into its own, i.e. determining who an infected person has been in contact with – when they were likely to be infectious – and ensuring all self isolate.Already Irish actions (notably physical distancing) taken so far confirm personal contacts have been reduced from 20 to 5, and of late tend to be confined to households.That said, given the current trajectory of cases and deaths, public health specialists say a further 75 per cent reduction is needed to ensure the curve is forced down. So it’s back to physical distancing in the knowledge it works and saves lives.Grounds for optimism– Tell-tale signs: Researchers are confirming the distinct traits of SARS-CoV-2 (the medical term for the virus) and key differences with influenza. It’s very stable and does not mutate much, i.e. alter its genetic mix as it spreads. In contrast, flu is like a pack of cards (made up of genetic parts) that shuffle every year. So there is good chance of generating an effective Covid-19 vaccine, while the annual flu vaccine is the best bet of leading immunologists, virologists and epidemiologists.– The scale of human decency: Communities are mobilising to help the most vulnerable within their localities. Action by industry and universities with to the aim of helping those at the healthcare frontline is equally impressive. DCU’s Nano Research Facility is switching operations to make sanitisers, and Trinity’s Biomedical Sciences Institute gathered all of its gloves, gowns and face masks and sent them to St James’s Hospital up the road. Such actions are replicated across the country and are saving lives.– Chink of hope on Italian front: There are tiny signs infection rate in Italy is moderating, notwithstanding its continuing, appalling death toll. These may merely be data blips. It suggests, none the less, the overall rate of increase is slowing as if the pandemic is losing momentum inside a country where it has nowhere to go. Ireland cannot ease its curtailment efforts as rising cases here show no indication yet we can avoid the same fate of Italy.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212213.1585204697!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a how does the covid 19 income support scheme work and who qualifies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhat about those taking home over €76,000? No subsidy is available for these earners. How will it work?The income support scheme is designed to help companies and other employers retain employees on their books through the duration of the pandemic by paying a subsidy equal to up to 70 per cent of their take-home pay, to a maximum of €410 a week. Employers are encouraged to top this up if they can. If they top up the payment, employers should pay no more than their normal take-home pay. Payments are made through the normal payroll process.How do you qualify? The scheme is available to employers in all sectors – excluding the public service and non-commercial semi-state sector – whose business activities are affected adversely by the coronavirus pandemic. The employer must show they have lost at least 25 per cent of turnover. There will also be a requirement that the company does not have the liquidity, or cash, to pay.Further details will be outlined in legislation due to be discussed by the Dáil on Thursday. It is available to employers who retain staff on payrolls and for workers who may be temporarily not working or on reduced hours or pay. Employers must be unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully. How are employers reimbursed by the State?Employers will be recompensed for paying employees through the Revenue Commissioners as operators of the scheme. Reimbursements will be made within two working days.For how long will it run? The scheme, which has yet to be approved by the Dáil, will run initially for 12 weeks from March 26th. The scheme is designed so that it will allow employers to retain links to their workers for when business picks up after the crisis.How does this work for earnings up to €38,000 a year? The scheme is specifically designed to help this group, which includes many working in the worst-affected sectors, such as pubs, hotels and retail. Based on a subsidy of up to 70 per cent of take-home pay, a single person on €30,000 a year with after-tax pay of €489 a week will have their earnings subsidised by the Government to the tune of €342 a week. Their employer can top it up as far as possible to their previous salary if they have the cash. For someone on €35,000, their current take-home pay is €558 a week. They would receive €391 from their employer, who will then be refunded. The maximum subsidy is €410 a week for someone on €38,000.And for earnings between €38,000 and €76,000?Officials are still finalising exactly how this will work for middle-income earners. They are not seen as quite as vulnerable to lay-off as the lower-paid group, though many businesses will inevitably be looking at pay cuts and lay-offs in this group also. The information released to date says that an income subsidy of up to €350 a week would be available, through employers, for people in this earnings bracket. However, the indications are the subsidy will be graduated: those earning just over €38,000 will qualify for the full subsidy, but the subsidy will gradually be withdrawn as earnings rise. So someone on €50,000, for example, might qualify for a €250 a week income subsidy approximately, to add to whatever their employer can afford.What about earnings above €76,000No subsidy is available for these earners. The scheme is designed to help lower- and middle-income employees.How will it be operational so quickly?It seems that for the first few weeks, once firms register for the scheme, they will receive the full €410 a week for all qualifying employees – even for the €38,000 to €76,000 group who will receive a maximum of €350 a week when the scheme is fully operational. This is designed to get the scheme up and running immediately. The Revenue has not said what arrangement will be put in place to recoup overpayments as the majority will not qualify for the full €410 subsidy when the scheme is fully operational in mid-April.What are the complications?It is reasonably straightforward for those earning up to €38,000, though some part-time employees might end up better off on the Covid-19 unemployment payment. Some way may be found to address this.It is more complicated for the €38,000 to €76,000 group as the graduation is being introduced and tax and PRSI become much bigger complications on the amount of top-ups paid by employers. The hope is to work out the details to have it fully operational by April 20th.For now, companies must apply by saying they meet the criteria and give details of their employees in various bands. The cash will start to flow and the full details will be worked out later.What about the self-employed or unemployed? No. Self-employed people who are out of work because of the pandemic or employees who are made redundant will be eligible for the State’s Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment of €350 rather than the income subsidy scheme run by the Revenue. They will be eligible on a similar basis as the Revenue scheme applies to employees. Anyone who was unemployed before this crisis will continue to receive the jobseeker’s allowance of €203 a week.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Accused (39) due to appear at Belfast Magistrates courtAn Bord Plean\u0026aacutela upholds appeal against Dublin City Council decisionGarda\u0026iacute say two other occupants of house are uninjuredPlans in place to ensure clinics can stay open in the event of further travel restrictionsEU warning comes as two more patients with Covid-19 die, and 235 new cases reported\u0026lsquoIt could be ready in 12 to 18 months.

Photograph:  Kevin DugganLittle more than a week ago, Co Mayo native Amy Brett was gearing up for the busiest time of the year at the Bailey Pub near Wall Street as St Patrick’s Day dawned. Today, she is back in Cavan, quarantining in a holiday home before returning to her family.Along with four fellow Irish bartenders who have returned from New York, she is in a 14-day self-imposed quarantine at the holiday home until they are able to return to their families.For the past five years, Brett has worked in New York bars, which have been brought to a standstill by the outbreak of coronavirus.Rumours of a closure order by New York mayor, Bill de Blasio floated after organisers postponed the St Patrick’s Day parade down Fifth Avenue for the first time in 258 years.On March 16th, the mayoral order finally hit.Together with the four fellow Irish bartenders, Brett immediately made plans to head for Ireland: “I panicked and I thought the best thing to do was to come home. God forbid you’re stuck here,” she said.The business curbs have devastated bars and restaurants. Already, one prominent company, the Union Hospitality Group has laid off 2,000 employees – about 80 per cent of its workforce – according to a report by the food blog Eater.A Co Sligo man on a year-long J-1 visa decided to cut his losses and leave his Manhattan bar job: “I could have lasted maybe a month or two, but I would have been out of pocket pretty quickly,” he said.Unable to be identified because his visa did not allow him work, he came back to Ireland: “I came home and there’s no hugging, it’s all touch elbows and keep your distance. It’s quite a strange way to come back.”He and many others have had to abandon their apartments, with New York Irish Facebook groups filling up with dozens of listings for rooms in popular Irish neighbourhoods across Brooklyn and Queens in the past week.The decision of whether to stick out the pandemic, or return home faces many Irish in New York and other places, according to Chicago-based Irish-American immigration attorney Fiona McEntee.“It’s a pretty scary time and some people just want to be surrounded by their family,” she said, though she cautioned that “the last thing” anyone potentially exposed to the virus should be doing is “to jump on a flight”.Freelance workers are being particularly affected, says Edelle Kenny, a New York-based producer who works on reality TV shows for American stations like the Discovery Channel and TLC.“I just had two major contracts dropped, which would be the equivalent of a year’s wage,” she said.She does not get health and unemployment benefits because she is self-employed: “We’re kind of left in the lurch.”“You come over here and you start building a life for yourself. Six years is a long time to be here and now you’re thinking, will this just throw everything off, by no fault of your own or anyone’s fault.”Ms Kenny is also on an interim work permit due to expire in May, while she transitions from a two-year Green Card to a 10-year one and she’s concerned that her immigration case could get caught in a backlog and delays with the authorities.Some Irish people, however, are stuck in the US because they will not be able to get back in if they leave now: “If you’re not a Green Card holder or a US citizen you do need to think about the immigration aspects of this, especially with the travel ban,” said Fiona McEntee.For now, Amy Brett and her friends plan to return to New York once it is safe to do so but she said if the situation persists for several months, many more Irish will pack up and leave the city.“If New York bars don’t reopen by May, you’ll see a lot of people move home to Ireland,” she said.“But we’re pure anxious, it’s just not knowing when we’re going to go back. New York is home now.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212285.1585170339!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"creches look for clarity on zappone financial assistance scheme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKatherine Zappone has been told that her ‘proposal will immediately result in the termination of employment for a significant number of staff’. File photograph: The Creche groups have written to Minister for Children Katherine Zappone seeking further clarity on her bailout of the sector, which will mean the State effectively nationalises the wage bill for creches in exchange for waiving of fees charged to parents for the next three months. Early Childhood Ireland (ECI) has raised several queries with the Department of Children, including whether operators will have a choice about signing the new emergency Covid-19 contract.They have also asked for clarity on issues concerning holiday pay, maternity leave and how owners who do not pay themselves a salary will be treated. While ECI welcomed the proposal, some creche groups have objected to the scheme, according to correspondence seen by The . In a letter to Ms Zappone, the Federation of Early Childhood Providers argued that in the absence of the subsidies, while wages will be covered, significant cash-flow issues will emerge. “Your proposal of yesterday will result in services not being able to meet their overheads or fund the payment of staff as we will have considerable cash flow issues. Your proposal will immediately result in the termination of employment for a significant number of staff, running into the tens of thousands, and the closure of a vast number of services nationwide.”Under a scheme announced by the Government on Tuesday, the department will pay 30 per cent of wages up to a level of €38,000 per year for the next three months, on top of the Government’s wider scheme to cover 70 per cent of wages up to this level.Due to the relatively low average salary in the sector, this will cover the majority of the wage bill across the sector. However, the department is suspending other subsidies it usually pays to creches during this period and replacing them with this single payment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212190.1585163540!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s like 28 days later coronavirus turns dublin into a ghost town","story":"After recent coronavirus restrictions only a handful of retail outlets are now open on Ireland\u0027s premier shopping street, Grafton Street, Dublin.

On Wednesday, the warmest and sunniest day of the year so far, it was deserted.The birds had the ponds, the grass and paths to themselves. The handful of people who had come through the wrought-iron gates sat alone on benches, staring stony-faced at flowers newly in bloom.A Grafton Street jeweller had been stripped of its window displays by staff anxious to protect valuables. The clothes shop next door was boarded up, as if prepared for a hurricane.Many pubs were not just closed, but shuttered, too. A Luas set off for Cabra with just three passengers. Two wore surgical masks. The driver wore bright yellow rubber gloves. In any other time it would have been comical.A small group of young men approached the gates of the green, their voices among the only to be heard. “This is what the zombie apocalypse must be like,” one said loudly.Following Leo Varadkar’s Tuesday restrictions, most people seemed to have heeded the Taoiseach’s plea to “stay home if at all possible”.Leaning on his cane, an older man who identified himself as Kevin O’Malley said, from a distance of more than 2m, “It’s a different world now”.“Do you know what this reminds me of? It reminds me of a film I saw more than 50 years ago. On the Beach, it was called,” he said, referring to a 1950s post-apocalyptic film starring Gregory Peck and Fred Astaire.“There is a scene in the film when the crew of a submarine come to the surface after the nuclear war and when they look around there is just nothing there. That’s what I am reminded of today.“I suppose the real worry is how long will it all last. But you know what, we will get through this, of course we will. This country is nothing if not resilient.”Cigarette tradeSome shops remained open. Mark Halligan was at work in one of them, the Bus Stop newsagent at the top of Grafton Street. He was in the shop alone, dispensing coffee, selling newspapers and face masks.“What people want to buy mainly are cigarettes,” he said. “They are coming in and buying hundreds of them. I don’t know why really. We are going to stay open. It’s like the film 28 Days Later, isn’t it?”A homeless man, Michael, came into the shop. Asked how he was getting on, he told of how the pattern of his day on the streets had changed.“Every morning I would get up at 7.30 and get a cup of coffee in Starbucks. I can’t do that now, it’s closed. Everything is closed. There is nothing open and nothing for me to do and no one for me to talk to.“I’ve been on the streets for more than four years and I had a routine,” he said, “Now I am just trying to figure out the days ahead and how I will get by.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210095.1585049188!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pet owners advised to practise social distancing with animals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA spokeswoman for the ISPCA said there was no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread  coronavirus. File photograph taken at Dogs Trust: Fran VealePet owners should make relatively small adjustments to the routines of their animals, but there is no need to be alarmist or abandon dogs, according to vets and other medical authorities. Bray, Co Wicklow-based vet Pete Wedderburn said “dogs and cats cannot get coronavirus, but you should keep your dog two metres from other dogs and humans if you are out for a walk”, he said. In addition to not getting the virus, Mr Wedderburn said dogs could not transmit it to humans, in an aerosol fashion, through droplets. But he said social distancing should be extended to pets just in case a pet comes into contact with the virus through, for example, somebody sneezing on it. “Like any other surface, a dog’s coat can carry viruses back to a human, so there has to be a little isolation involved,” he explained. “Shampoo will keep a dog clean and will kill any viruses.” “If your cat is the kind that likes to visit two or three other homes during the day, think about keeping him indoors,” he said.Veterinary Ireland, the profession’s national representative organisation, said veterinary practices would endeavour to remain open throughout the Covid-19 crisis, but clients must phone first for an appointment. Those in isolation should not allow others to touch their pets, the organisation said.Dundrum pet food supplier Shane Walsh of Breffini House Pets said owners were making an effort “to do the best for their pets”. He said owners had been making sure they had enough supplies, “but not stockpiling”. Mr Walsh said there was “no shortage”.No evidenceThe ISPCA national animal centre in Longford and the DSPCA centre in Rathfarnham have closed to the public but animals are still being cared for at both centres. A spokeswoman for the ISPCA said there was no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats could spread coronavirus. “According to experts, Covid-19 cannot be transmitted from human to animal or vice versa. If your pet is touched by someone with coronavirus, then there is the potential that it can be spread, should someone else come into contact with your pet but the risk of this is extremely low,” spokeswoman Carmel Murray said. “We are asking pet owners not to worry about their pets,” she said. “It is important to interact with your pets as normal and to wash your hands regularly after contact with any animal.” The World Health Organisation has also reiterated there is no evidence that pets such as the family dog or cat can spread coronavirus to humans. It was commenting after publicity surrounding the Hong Kong dog which produced a “weak positive” in a test for coronavirus. The journal Science, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said the Pomeranian dog based in Hong Kong was found to have shown a “weak positive” in a test for the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19. However, WHO said coronavirus was transmitted primarily through droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing or a discharge from saliva and the nose. While pets were well known for their affectionate licks and runny noses, even sneezes, there were no known cases of such a transfer happening, the WHO said.ISPCA tips and adviceWhen out walking your dog, you should ensure they are kept on a short lead and under control at all times. Restrict contact with other people and animals and adhere to social distancing guidelines.Continue to exercise and play with your pets to alleviate stress in the confines of your garden.There are plenty of ways to keep your pets entertained such as putting their favourite treats in a Kong pet toy, using food puzzle toys, playing fetch or tug-of-war with their favourite toy.This is a good time to teach your pets some new tricks. The ISPCA would love to see your cute animal photos or videos.Avoid sharing your food or being kissed or licked by your pet and always wash your hands. It’s important you have sufficient pet food, prescribed medication or other essentials such as cat litter during self-isolation. Plan ahead in the event you need help caring for your pets short or long term.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210749.1585041793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan to bring home irish people stranded in peru awaiting green light from lima","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A Peruvian soldier patrols during the COVID-19 restrictions in Lima, Peru. Photograph: Paolo AguilarEPAThe Government’s plan to bring home 135 Irish people stranded in Peru by the country’s coronavirus lockdown is awaiting the green light from the government in Lima.An email to those stranded sent on Monday morning by the Irish embassy in Chile said the timing of the proposed charter flight out of Lima “will depend on how soon our aircraft can be accommodated by the Peruvian authorities”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTÉ on Sunday an agreement has been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a flight from Lima “in the next few days”. As well as Irish nationals dependants who are entitled to live in Ireland can also take the flight.The embassy email also said Irish authorities “will confirm details in due course for bus transfers within Peru from agreed locations to the military airport in Lima”. Only an estimated half of the 135 Irish, most of whom are backpackers, are currently in Lima with local travel restrictions preventing the rest making their own way to the capital.Repatriation will cost each traveller €400 but they will not be required to pay the fare in advance. Anyone diagnosed or showing symptoms of coronavirus, also know as Covid-19, will not be able to travel. At least six people have died of the virus in Peru with another 363 people confirmed infected.‘Not straightforward’Mr Coveney told RTÉ that organising the flight out of Peru “is not straighforward”. France and Israel are among the countries that have already sent planes to bring their nationals home. But thousands of other foreigner are still stranded in one of South America’s most popular tourist destinations.Peru has all but shut its land air and sea frontiers in response to the global pandemic. It announced a strict 15-day stay-in-doors quarantine on March 16th giving foreigners just 24 hours to leave the country. Many were left stranded and have since been reliant on their respective government to come up with a solution to get them out.On Sunday authorities closed fully the international airport in Lima. Now only flights bringing home Peruvian citizens or coming to evacuate foreign nationals can fly into the country and must land at the capital’s military airbase. Travellers stranded at the international airport were forced to make their way to the base in the hope of their governments sending planes to rescue them.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212746.1585220784!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish tourists stranded in peru wait for government evacuation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMarie Barry and Andrew Cotter, both from Cork,  arrived in Peru from Bolivia two days before the national lockdown was announced. The imposition of up to three months of quarantine on a hostel in Cusco after a Covid-19 cluster was detected there has left Irish tourists stranded in the Peruvian city increasingly nervous as they wait for a Government evacuation to get underway.Peruvian health officials on Wednesday ordered what they described as “absolute quarantine” for between one and three months of the Pariwana hostel after two guests, one from the Netherlands and another from Finland, tested positive for coronavirus.Among the estimated 120 guests now subjected to the lockdown is Belfast tourist Rhys McKendry. “When the announcement first came out a lot of people actually started crying. To be told two people had tested positive was a pretty big blow,” he said.Tests on the two guests were ordered after they showed symptoms of having the virus. A previous guest is believed to have started showing symptoms after returning home. Peru ordered a national lockdown on March 16th and has all but sealed its air, land and sea borders, stranding thousands of foreign tourists.The news of the strict quarantine at the Pariwana quickly spread on WhatsApp among other Irish tourists stuck in Cusco. Many wondered if they should leave their own hostels for Airbnb accommodation to avoid being caught up in a similar Covid-19 outbreak. They said they were afraid this could lead to them missing an evacuation flight being organised by the Government.Around 135 Irish tourists, most of them backpackers, have registered for repatriation from Peru. Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTÉ on Sunday an agreement has been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a flight from Lima “in the next few days”.In a statement on Wednesday the Department of Foreign Affairs said while an agreement was in place for a flight to go, “internal travel remains heavily restricted and many of our citizens are located hundreds of miles away from the international airport. We are working 24 hours to get the necessary transport and permissions in place to move them.”News that flights left Lima for the UK, Spain and Switzerland caused frustration about the delay in starting the repatriation among some of those stuck in Cusco. “It can be done. It is being done. But from our perspective it seems to be very slow and that is worrying us,” says Mr Cotter.In the Pariwana hostel, Mr McKendry says he has not given up hope of being able to get on the repatriation flight. He is yet to be tested for Covid-19. “I believe being tested might be my only option of getting out, so I am going to ask the doctors if it is possible,” he says.Since the quarantine was announced the Pariwana’s guests are being confined to their dorms for 23 hours with management warning of the possibility “we have more infections among us”. The hostel’s TV and computer rooms are now sealed off. The two tourists who tested positive are isolated in separate dorms from other guests.The Peruvian authorities said any guests who failed to obey strict social distancing measures could face between five to 10 years in jail. Each guest has been issued with a mask and assigned their own plate and cutlery. “The staff are staying with us in the hostel which shows how committed they are and we’re getting three meals a day. At lunch we were just two to a table that the day before sat eight,” says Mr McKendry.Late on Wednesday night Irish time, the Irish Embassy in Chile tweeted: “We are aware of the 2 cases of coronavirus confirmed in a hostel in Cusco in Peru. Neither of the people with positive tests are Irish citizens. Our Ambassador spoke today with the one Irish citizen staying at the same hostel and they will remain in contact over the coming days.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211096.1585071291!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus leading irish medic in us castigates lunatic in charge over delays","story":"March 20th, 2020: US president Donald Trump threw a tantrum over a question on peoples fears of Covid-19 at a White House press briefing. Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Garret FitzGerald: ‘The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.’ Photograph: Eric LukeThe United States is showing every indication it will outstrip China in coronavirus cases, and is already “not far behind them”, according to one of its leading medics Prof Garret FitzGerald.The US is about to experience a surge in cases in a scenario where President Donald Trump delayed taking decisive action, and squandered early advantage he had secured by default, added the University of Pennsylvania professor of pharmacology and therapeutics.Referring to Trump as “the lunatic in charge”, FitzGerald said that by restricting travel from China for largely xenophobic reasons he may have bought time, but subsequent delays on testing and restrictions undermined this. “He continues to send mixed messages,” FitzGerald said.Trump’s failure meant the most effective strategic response came at state level, with key governors dictating necessary pace. FitzGerald cited New York Times analysis showing that awareness was behind in other states, a disparity between red (Republican) and blue (Democrat) states, with the latter scaling up action. “The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.”DeathsHe questioned how many extra deaths would be due to delays and misinformation. The president has continued to describe chloroquine drugs used to treat malaria and other conditions, as “game changers” in the fight against coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, when there was no proper study to show they work, noted FitzGerald, who is originally from Ireland.In response to misleading advice from the French health minister Olivier Véran, FitzGerald has a letter in the latest issue of the research journal Science, highlighting how he wrongly issued a warning on painkillers – notably nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on which he is a global authority.His letter had gone viral through social media channels. “So that is good. It was a silly thing to say at several levels,” he said, “In a sense, it was like Trump’s ignorance of science.”Véran confused matters by claiming on Twitter that anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or cortisone could aggravate coronavirus infection – when people taking NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop doing so for fear of increasing their coronavirus risk.He advised people to take paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead to treat a fever but this only added to confusion, given it is also an NSAID.Flawed advice was being compounded by fake news and irresponsible behaviour, FitzGerald said, citing reports that four young people taking NSAIDs for sports injuries were in ICU in Cork.It added up to “a fusion of unreality” and was a wake-up call for the public on “why pervasive ignorance of science comes at a price. Trump is the ultimate metaphor as far as that is concerned.”Healthcare workers were displaying remarkable dedication and bravery in a similar way to Ireland, while the scientific community had been mobilised on rapid development of vaccines new drugs and apps to monitor and advise people. But there were specific dangers in the US scenario.There were long delays before rigorous separation was implemented. Its health system was fragmented, varying between best healthcare and none. There was rowback on Obamacare in a system where too many had no health insurance and “uneven sick pay”, motivating many people to go work.FitzGerald said there was a lot less social cohesion in the US compared to Ireland but stressed he was outlining a worst-case scenario.He is scaling down research at his facility while helping a national effort to ramp up coronavirus-related research and share vast amounts of data in a harmonised way – all done remotely.This will involve work on hundreds of thousands of patients post-infection, to identify key contributing factors to spread and infection. This had to be done in a safe way not to impair front-line clinical work.As he is in a higher risk age group he will not be on the front line but expected to be “called up” to deal with patients “back from the front line”.He added: “We’re very fortunate. We see what’s coming. We can work remotely, and have sick pay and health insurance. We’re at the elite end of the vulnerability spectrum.”Those most at risk were vast numbers of people with no health insurance – separate to those who were homeless.FitzGerald feared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious disease who is helping to lead the national response, would be fired by Trump.Republican business interests were pressurising the president to allow people go back to work. “Fauci won’t accept that. We will see.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Self-employed warned Chancellor\u0026#39s rescue package today might not be \u0026#39perfect\u0026#39, ahead of Rishi Sunak\u0026#39s announcementCoronavirus latest news: Some lockdown restrictions could last six months, says Deputy Chief Medical Officer When will coronavirus peak in the UK?  Why the death rate is so bad in Spain – and what it means for the UKWATCH: First look inside new temporary coronavirus ExCeL London hospitalHow long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

Listen to the campaign of shame being mounted against all those people apparently defying the lockdown and the answer is surely yes. In parks up and down the land people are recklessly congregating with friends. Workplaces are packed with employees wheezing their way into the office in defiance of that pesky cough. On every front, conscientious objectors in the corona war are undermining our national defence. Or so we are told.All the evidence suggests that this is an absurd caricature. And, worse than merely painting us in a bad light, talking Britons down in this way is only likely to make the efforts to defeat coronavirus tougher.If a recent YouGov poll showing that 93 per cent of people back the Government’s strategy is to be believed then those wilfully defying the rules are nothing but a tiny minority. It would be wrong to accept uncritically such an extraordinary figure, but it doesn’t seem wildly out of kilter with what is happening.I know of nobody whose job can reasonably be done from home who has insisted on going in anyway. More tellingly, I know plenty who have lost jobs as businesses accept their (hopefully temporary) fate and shut down. That such closures have been mandated with virtually no backlash, all in the name of a virus that seems to afflict many people mildly, is to my mind both astonishing and laudable. No less astonishing has been the reaction of business owners. For every Tim Martin, Mike Ashley or Richard Branson whose actions have amounted to a PR disaster, there have been countless companies – from corner shops to multinationals – that have made real sacrifices to provide for their staff and support their communities. All of this stands as evidence of a nation pulling together from top to bottom. For every delinquent deliberately coughing on a police officer, think of all the grandparents who celebrated Mothering Sunday at the end of a phone. For every small gathering in a park, think of the commitment of somebody like Scott Sneddon, who went viral after moving out of his house because his daughter has cancer and is at risk.Choosing to overlook these eminent success stories – as both ministers and armchair hand-wringers have done – in favour of lazily heaping opprobrium on the tiny number of rebels risks seriously backfiring. At the moment, the challenge for the Government is communicating the new rules and encouraging people to start following them. But as the days turn into weeks, the difficulty will be getting us to stick with it. To achieve that, it is vital that we all feel like we’re in it together.We humans are happiest, by and large, when we’re going along with the crowd. It is uncomfortable being the odd one out even the contrarians among us have experienced it. Just think of any time you’ve turned down a beer at lunch because everybody else at the table chose a soft drink.That impulse has been backed up in various ways by social scientists. In one classic experiment from the 1950s, a very high proportion of participants were willing to give the wrong answer to a simple question if it meant agreeing with a set of stooges who had deliberately answered it incorrectly before them. More recently, studies have shown that one especially effective way of influencing behaviour is to tell people that a large percentage of those around them are already doing something similar. Think back on that poll I quoted earlier. If only 30 per cent of Brits supported the Government, how would that make you feel about staying indoors all day?Herein lies the great mistake with the shaming strategy. A 100 per cent lockdown is too impractical ever to be enforced fully. Given that some dissenters are inevitable, fixating on them only makes them seem more significant. Let the idea take hold that everybody else is out on a jolly and those of us at home feel like fools. The bullying nature of this approach also risks triggering our instinct to kick back. The state of lockdown sits uneasily with the British people. The more we feel forced into it, the greater the temptation to stick two fingers up to the “little Hitlers” in charge. It would be far better to focus on the at-home majority and how together we are making a real difference. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Just a day earlier, the mayor of Moscow became the first senior official to suggest that poor testing for Covid-19 could be hiding the real scale of the epidemic. This global map still shows Russia with a relatively low infection rate compared to other countries:Mr Putin did not say, however, how the private sector, battered by business closures and a low demand, is supposed to pay its employees next week but unveiled a raft of government measures to support families and businesses which have taken a beating from the crisis.The outbreak of Covid-19 has coincided with a busy political season in Russia after President Putin in January floated constitutional changes aimed to overhaul the country’s political system.A few weeks later, Mr Putin shocked the nation by taking up on a lawmaker’s offer to let him run for president again in 2024. An amendment for the Constitution potentially allowing him to stay in power until 2036 breezed through parliament earlier this month and was expected to come up for a public vote next month.Although he officially set the vote for April 22, Mr Putin on Wednesday postponed it to a later day, citing concerns about coronavirus.“People’s health, lives and security are an absolute priority for us,” he said.In a bid to reassure the nation Mr Putin said on Wednesday that the measures that the government has taken will work, but “only if we pull together and recognise the complexity of the situation.”Mr Putin in his speech, which did not appear any more dramatic than his recent appearances, came across as more laid-back than some other Russian officials including the mayor of Moscow.Earlier on Wednesday, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, who has ordered a citywide lockdown for people over 65, warned that the epidemic is getting worse and urged for more social distancing in the Russian capital.Opposition figures have criticised the president for failing to call a nationwide emergency or to be assertive about spelling out the danger of the disease.“A large number of people are not aware yet of how serious the situation is, and a surprise holiday can, unfortunately, lead to an increase, not a drop, in social interaction,” opposition activist Leonid Volkov said in his blog.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tourists stranded philippines join calls british repatriation","story":"British travellers in the Philippines have appealed to the UK government to send repatriation flights amid reports of tourists being forced to sleep on the streets after being thrown out of their hotels during a countrywide coronavirus lockdown. Hundreds of Brits are believed to be trapped in curfewed cities or remote locations, including popular holiday islands that have weak healthcare systems and lack the facilities to deal with the virus which is now sweeping through the Southeast Asian nation. Many tourists have reported being denied boarding on emergency Philippine government flights back to the capital, Manila, because they do not have tickets for onward international destinations, which are now all but impossible to find. The unprecedented travel chaos has been reflected in the growing frustration of Teodoro Locsin Jr, the normally outspoken foreign secretary, on his Twitter feed. He continued to vent at local governments who were not allowing foreigners to board the so-called “sweeper” flights to take them closer to international airports, questioning if officials were “taking drugs?”He added: “Foreign ambassadors: please call me if there are f--k ups getting your nationals out.”But getting to Manila or Clark international airports is only the first part of a logistical nightmare for tourists as most international commercial flights out of the Philippines are grounded and major transit routes blocked. According to Mr Locsin, the Russians, Poles and Germans are among several countries sending aircraft to help repatriate citizens in need. Trapped British tourists have created Facebook pages and taken to social media to appeal for the UK government to do the same. Paige Whittle, 23, from Solihull, told the  she was trapped on Siargao, a tiny island known as the surfing capital of the Philippines, with four other British travellers, all of them despairing about what to do. “It’s at a point now where we need the government to either say stay where you are, it’s safer there than trying to get back through other countries or we’re going to send a flight out to try and help get you home,” she said. The group had been stranded after domestic flights were grounded and they were not allowed to board a government sweeper flight because were unable to rebook rapidly disappearing onward international flights. “My friends that did manage to book onwards travel either managed to make it home after spending thousands of pounds on flights or others were trapped sleeping on cardboard outside Clark airport for hours as they wouldn’t let them stay inside,” she said. Ms Whittle and her friends are currently holed up in an AirBnB with only one of the group permitted to pass through police roadblocks to buy provisions.They fear that escaping to Manila without a ticket home could leave them in a worse predicament as hotels close, forcing them to sleep on the streets. “People in Cebu or Manila are hysterical because they have spent thousands and thousands on flights that are just getting cancelled,” she said. “ In a WhatsApp group for stranded Brits, one person said they got to Dubai, had all of their flight tickets taken off them and they have all been locked inside the airport and can’t catch onward flights. We don’t want to risk that happening to us.”While she and her friends are safe for now, they are running out of money and also anxious that there are no healthcare facilities within easy reach. “The thing that is scaring us the most is that this island has an outbreak and we’re all stranded in the middle of nowhere and we can’t get any help,” she said. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has supported tourists’ calls for government-backed flights. “The government cannot keep passing the buck to others, especially when it comes to repatriation. Yes, it’s difficult. Yes, it’s expensive, but that is the nature of the crisis that we face,” she said in parliament. The British embassy in Manila has posted advice to tourists on its Twitter feed. A spokesperson said that the embassy team was working around the clock to keep flight routes open, had already helped over 200 British nationals to return to the UK, and urged travellers to contact them. “We know this is a real concern for visitors to the Philippines where commercial routes have been fragmented for several days and are diminishing, causing distress and disruption for some travellers trying to get home,” said the spokesperson.    “Due to the complexity of inidual cases, rapidly changing restrictions and the unprecedented demand we haven’t been able to respond to enquires as quickly as we - or you - would like.” More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking

of coronavirus, following mounting pressure as the World Health Organization announced it is probing the link.The measure was discussed on Tuesday at a meeting of the Science Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), it is understood, following a spate of reports that anosmia is a feature of Covid-19.Currently, people in the UK are instructed to self-isolate only if they have a persistent cough, or a high temperature, or both.This puts the government at odds with France, where people with loss of taste and smell are being advised to consider self-isolating even if they lack the main two symptoms.On Monday the WHO revealed they are looking into the apparent symptoms and encouraging national health officials to investigate reports in their countries.UK experts have said that, in the absence of widespread testing, smell and taste deprivation could be a vital means of identifying otherwise asymptomatic spreaders of the virus.Last night a government source said: The CMO and SAGE are looking at it and taking it seriously. “It’s a quickly developing virus and they are looking at all the available evidence.“If the science does back two features as being a symptom, they will make a decision on that.”Anecdotal reports from northern Italy suggest as many as 50 per cent of doctors involved in fighting the virus have temporarily lost the faculties.Meanwhile the American Academy of Otolaryngology has also called for anosmia to be added to a list of screening tools for Covid-19In a study published in late February in the journal Nature, researchers in South Korea concluded that 30 per cent of roughly 2,000 patients who tested positive for coronavirus had at some point lost their sense of smell.In Germany, clinicians at the University Hospital in Bonn surveyed 100 patients with coronavirus and found that up to two-thirds “described a loss of smell and taste lasting several days.Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said on Monday: “A loss of smell or a loss of taste is something that we’re looking into.“We are reaching out to a number of countries and looking at the cases that have already been reported to see if this is a common feature.“We don’t have the answer to that yet.”Earlier this week the football presenter Gary Lineker announced he was self-isolating because is 28-year-old son George had “complete loss of sense of taste and smell”.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular biology at the University of Nottingham, urged British health authorities to adopt a broader definition of Covid-19.“When you look at the medical reports describing how cases are presenting, particularly mild infections, coronavirus patients clearly have cold-like symptoms.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for

The mother of one employee told The Independent she was concerned that Dexters\u0027 approach could put the health of her family and the wider public at unnecessary risk.The estate agent\u0027s founder and chairman Jeff Doble said he believed the criticism was unfair and that much of the work Dexters does cannot be carried out from home.He said Dexters was in the process of winding downon Tuesday but pointed to the fact that the government\u0027s lockdown announcement was only yesterday giving little time for firms to prepare.On Monday night, the prime minister told people not to go out apart from in very limited circumstances including attending medical appointments and buying food.\u0026nbspThe latest intensification of social distancing measures means people should only go out for work where this absolutely cannot be done from home.Anyone caught breaking the rules faces a fine of up to £1,000 from Thursday, when a bill containing the new legislation to deal with coronavirus is expected to become law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The mother of one employee told The Independent she was concerned that Dexters\u0027 approach could put the health of her family and the wider public at unnecessary risk.The estate agent\u0027s founder and chairman Jeff Doble said he believed the criticism was unfair and that much of the work Dexters does cannot be carried out from home.He said Dexters was in the process of winding downon Tuesday but pointed to the fact that the government\u0027s lockdown announcement was only yesterday giving little time for firms to prepare.On Monday night, the prime minister told people not to go out apart from in very limited circumstances including attending medical appointments and buying food.\u0026nbspThe latest intensification of social distancing measures means people should only go out for work where this absolutely cannot be done from home.Anyone caught breaking the rules faces a fine of up to £1,000 from Thursday, when a bill containing the new legislation to deal with coronavirus is expected to become law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Many others have done the same, leaving some landlords struggling to cover the cost of their property loans.Intu is now in talks with customers to negotiate payment, and with lenders to try and relax the rules on its own multibillion-pound debts.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsIntu said it is also in an “ongoing dialogue” with the government to try to obtain further loans from a state-backed £330bn package unveiled earlier this month.It comes after the government announced on Monday that businesses would not forfeit their leases if they chose to delay paying rent for the first quarter of the year.Shopping centres and high streets had already suffered from falling sales in February before the Covid-19 outbreak took hold, according to new official data.Heavy rains kept shoppers at home, leading to the worst growth in retail sales figures for seven years.Sales dropped 0.3 per cent in the month and were flat compared to a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Upload data spiked on Mothering Sunday as many families held video calls with loved ones.The number and length of landline calls have also increased in the last week, the company said.However, Virgin Media said the current traffic increases has still not pushed up demand to the levels seen during recent computer game releases or when multiple Premier League games were streamed simultaneously.Despite increased data use on our network, we\u0027re not at capacity and are continuing to provide our customers with the ultrafast and reliable services they expect, Ms York said.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The club - formed 15 years ago this spring in protest against Malcolm Glazer’s leveraged takeover of Manchester United - are just one of many in the non-league system fearing that the coronavirus pandemic will not only end their season but cause significant financial damage. And yet, their response to the unprecedented problems facing English football can provide a lesson for those further up the pyramid.Last week, the club’s board released a statement which caught the eye for two reasons. Firstly, while Uefa, the Premier League, the EFL and other footballing bodies held meetings on how best to squeeze the remainder of the 2019-20 season into a truncated schedule, FC announced they were “working to a scenario that the six remaining home games will not be played, and we will not resume until September”. Essentially, they declared their season was over.Secondly and more significantly, as promotion-chasing and relegation-battling clubs up and down the country lawyered up for the long and litigious months ahead, FC declared that they would not apply pressure - legally or otherwise - on those who must now come up with a fair way of ending the season. “There is little chance of a decision being possible that will satisfy all,” the club said. “We will accept any decision that the league reaches in this regard.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFC have every reason to fight their corner. After being relegated last year, Neil Reynolds’ side currently sit second in the Northern Premier League in the third tier of non-league football. Defeat to leaders South Shields in their last game before football’s suspension made automatic promotion an unlikely prospect. Even so, FC would have enjoyed home advantage in the end-of-season play-offs and would have been considered favourites to return to the National League North at the first time of asking.Even so, the club’s board, staff and players are united in accepting whatever fate comes their way. “With the history of the club, there is a wider perspective,” says Sam Mullock, FC’s deputy chair. “Fans used to say every time we kick off is a victory. Just having our own football club is victory enough. Success on the pitch is not everything for us. And we\u0027re absolutely not going to be fighting for a particular outcome which favours us in the league. I think the leagues need to be left in peace, to think about the issues and come to us with a fair way forward.”It is a refreshing stance. A remarkable one, in fact, given that this crisis is an existential threat to many clubs at non-league level. Mullock expects FC to incur a loss of around £100,000 due to coronavirus cancellations - £70,000 from six or seven lost home games and another £30,000 through functions, events and filming at Broadhurst Park which can no longer go ahead. For a club which emerged out of messy, well-documented internal struggles four years ago with financial problems to solve, that is a substantial hit to swallow.To mitigate it, FC have sought donations from a 2,087-strong membership base, the people through which the club is democratically run. “That\u0027s the strength of being a member-owned club. People are that extra bit invested,” says Mullock. “The first day the link went live, we had £600 donations. On Saturday, people were donating what they had spent in the bar, on a programme, things like that.” This will help to pay club staff and three contracted first-team players.The rest of the squad are on non-contract agreements - pay-as-you-play, essentially - and they tend to supplement their income through other precarious part-time work. The old FA Cup third round day cliché of builders, electricians and ‘postmen who always deliver’ is becoming less and less relevant at the non-league level nowadays. Personal trainers, youth workers and carers\u0026nbspare far more common. Whether their football wages are covered by the government\u0027s furloughed workers scheme is unclear.But FC’s current squad have embraced the club’s community ethos - “I think they\u0027ve all become members of the club. After games they stay around, shake hands, take photographs in the bar,” says Mullock - and to acknowledge that commitment, the club has set up a fund specifically for those players who will miss out on match fees due to the crisis. Members and supporters have been encouraged to donate separately to support a group of players who are not guaranteed to still be at the club next season by any means, but have nevertheless bonded with fans.At the same time, there is that ‘wider perspective’ Mullock mentioned earlier and the sense that the struggles of a football club should not be the main concern at the moment. “We\u0027re quite mindful that football is not the most important thing at the moment,” he says. “We can\u0027t just ram it down people\u0027s throats to start donating to a football club when people are worried about their own circumstances.”On Tuesday, steps three through to six of the non-league system decided - like FC a week earlier - that the 2019-20 season was effectively over. The National League was hoping to follow the Premier League and EFL’s example and extend the campaign into the summer but yesterday, they too fell into line. As the Isthmian League said in a strongly-worded statement, non-league clubs simply “do not have the financial resources to continue to honour player contracts indefinitely”.The Football Association must now help decide how to settle the season. Promotion and relegation may be enforced according to each team’s average points-per-game or the season could simply be declared null and void. If that happens, FC will lose out on and “one of the most satisfying and enjoyable seasons in the club’s history” will be scrubbed from the record. But if the game is to resolve the many questions posed by this crisis, more clubs will need to follow FC’s example, accept their fate and acknowledge there are more important things than football.FC United of Manchester\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That\u0027s half the amount of people who work in our pubs.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?In the recording, Mr Martin - seen clutching a mug and apparently at home - acknowledges the government will pay 80 per cent of the wages of staff at companies who have lost work during the crisis.But he said the money could take weeks to come through, and made no suggestion that Wetherspoon itself would cover the cost until the back payments arrived. The company has an annual turnover of £1.8 billion.In contrast to firms such as Costa – which has promised to carry on paying full wages for at least eight weeks – Mr Martin also suggested staff would receive no more than the government stipend.I can completely understand it.

However, Mr Khan’s spokesman insisted ministers were told “countless times” that Tube frequencies reflect high levels of staff sickness and self-isolation.Shortly before 7am on Wednesday, a senior nurse named Danny posted on Twitter: “Another busy tube. Can we not stagger people’s start times so we aren’t all squashed on the same tube! This is unsafe and not fair!”Barry Trimble, who said his work involves ensuring cancer patients receive chemotherapy, posted an image of a busy Victoria line carriage shortly after 7am on Wednesday.“The Tube is packed, with social distancing impossible. We need more people to stay at home and more trains running in morning and evening peak.”The Tube is currently operating at around 50 per cent of its normal capacity during peak times. Transport for London\u0026nbsp(TfL)\u0026nbsphas pledged to “continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can”.On Tuesday Mr Hancock said: “Transport for London should have the Tube running in full so that people travelling on the Tube are spaced out and can be further apart – obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.“And there is no good reason in the information that I’ve seen that the current levels of Tube provision should be as low as they are.

He also said all nonessential workers should stay home.\u0026nbsp“This is the most drastic action we can take,” said Mr Cuomo. “This is not life as usual.”There have been more than 192 deaths due to Covid-19 in New York, and there are now more than 54,800 people diagnosed in the United States. Health experts have urged people to practice social distancing to help stop the spread of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than ever before in recent history, people are shuttered inside their homes across the nation and the world. Stephen Lovekin, a New York photographer, responded to the shutdown by taking to the streets to capture images of families at home in Ditmas Park, a neighbourhood in Brooklyn.\u0026nbsp“As a photographer I have always loved and been drawn to shooting portraits,” said Mr Lovekin. “So, when this Coronavirus\u0026nbsp began to rapidly spread, and people were ordered into “self-isolation” and “social distancing,” I began to feel compelled to document this unprecedented time.”Created with Sketch.Words at the window: Social isolation and the Coronavirus Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Agnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinAgnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinThe project, like the statewide lockdown, started a week ago.

In normal times, everyone is busy, at work all day.We rarely see even the lovely couple who live across the landing. The streets below teem with workers, always in a hurry.Now these streets are empty. Our neighbours stay indoors, self-isolating.But we still see each other more than ever before, on the way to supermarkets for Silver Hour or grabbing some fresh air. We stand well apart, chat about the only subject in town and exchange offers of help. The City of London has become a village again.We receive tip-offs about loo roll delivery times or surprise consignments of hand gel and wet wipes at the nearby ­pharmacy.WhatsApp support groups have sprung up, advising on contactless payment via online bank accounts or how to spend your time indoors. Laptops are a leline.A frail friend and neighbour politely declines my offer to pick up her prescription.“I’m inundated with calls,” she says. “Everyone’s so kind.”Not everything is so fraternal.There is real anger at the hoarders in our midst — at people like the couple who arrived home with trolleys piled high and a new freezer to store three months of food.The Sun picture of a ­Teesside shopper with  loo rolls hit a nerve, along with the scumbag who made £, selling them at £ each to pensioners.So did private cardiologist Dr Mark Ali, who — says The Sunday Times — made £.million in a week flogging coronavirus test kits for £ a go — three times the cost price.Most employers are doing the decent thing, using help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep workers on  per cent pay.But others are seizing the chance to slash their payroll, risking a huge spike in ­unemployment once the crisis is over. Some household-name ­companies have not covered themselves with glory.EasyJet effectively abandoned passengers stuck in foreign parts with no way home until Sunak stuffed taxpayers’ cash down their throats.My we and I escaped from Cyprus last week on one of the last ­scheduled flights before hotels and airports were shut down.A lot of EasyJet over-s passengers feared being stranded with nowhere to stay.This crisis has hit Downing Street hard, with ministers and officials working -hour days, almost hot-bedding in No as they struggle to cope with fast-changing events.London, the UK epicentre of contagion, is in lockdown as the death toll spurts faster than tragic Italy’s at this stage of the spread. Did Boris get it right  We’ll soon know.It is interesting to observe the reaction of dferent age groups to this pandemic.Schoolchildren are understandably scared by the headlines. Old folk, some of them war babies, are more fatalistic.But some in their s and s are flagrantly ignoring advice to self-isolate.They are the least likely to die of this bug but risk putting thousands of fellow Brits in an early grave.A few months ago, the UK was split by what now seems a harmless spat over Brexit.There were Remainer black “jokes” that Britain would rejoin the EU once all we Brexit fogies had popped our clogs and the Eurosceptic virus had been eliminated.Covid- may be culling the elderly, but at least it’s impartial.They applaud their “friends” in Russia, China and others even more extreme who will take advantage of crippled Western economies, especially in Europe.Once we are through this pandemic, the next truly momentous battle will be between the West’s cash-strapped but creative “free spirits” and the authoritarian iron fists of the former Soviet era. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our nation will never be the same again.So many features of our society will be transformed, from the way we are governed to where we work and how we entertain ourselves.The state will be far bigger and more powerful. Free enterprise will no longer flourish. Welfare dependency, even for businesses, will the new norm.Our social lives will reshape around the home, with travel firms, cinemas and restaurants feeling the burden, while key workers like our NHS heroes will replace narcissistic celebrities in our adoration.And in practice, we will live under a socialist system, where the government has effectively nationalised the entire economy.That dramatic change will be a legacy of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Treasury in the face of the coronavirus challenge.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has recently announced a range of policies that amount to the biggest bailout in history, including a £ billion rescue package for businesses, a massive expansion in the social security system, and an unprecedented subsidy of up to  per cent for wages in the private sector.This vast intervention is on top of the Budget a fortnight ago, in which Mr Sunak announced the biggest increase in public expenditure since the s, as well as a colossal £ billion capital investment fund for infrastructure projects.Great Britain PLC has now been the subject of a takeover by the state.Mr Sunak’s phenomenal splurge is more radical than anything even Jeremy Corbyn proposed at the last election. And the clock will not be turned back.Having tasted economic control on an epic scale, Whitehall and Westminster will be reluctant to give it up.After all, the post-war socialist expansion of the state by the - Labour Government was not reversed for decades, despite long periods of Conservative rule, until Margaret Thatcher came to power in .Recent nationalisations like those of the railways and airlines will remain in place. The public sector will continue to dominate.But the new socialist Britain will be poorer and less dynamic.The services sector, which currently accounts for  per cent of the economy, will take decades to recover from the shutdown imposed by the coronavirus panic.With the collapse of so many businesses, especially in the hospitality trade and retailing, mass unemployment will cast a long shadow.At the same time, record levels of government debt will require huge levels of borrowing and higher taxation.The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis will probably also make our nation more inward-looking and less enthusiastic about globalisation.The barriers that are now going up around Europe will remain in place, while Britain is likely to impose stronger border controls.Immigration, currently running at over , new arrivals every year, is bound to plummet, especially when shrunken firms cannot claim to need cheap foreign labour.The international travel industry will continue to struggle once the crisis is over, with clients fearful of health risks.With reduced activity, it seems doubtful that the third runway at Heathrow Airport will ever be built.Ruined airlines and cruise companies will look back on pre-corona days as a golden age, though domestic tourism may receive a boost from the greater number of Brits holidaying at home.The Covid- catastrophe has exposed how fragile our inter-connected world really is.In an attempt to reduce our vulnerability, Britain is likely to become far more self-sufficient by strengthening our domestic supply lines, rebuilding our manufacturing base and bolstering the agricultural sector.Similarly, our dangerous dependence on Chinese contractors for everything from nuclear power to broadband technology will end.Future governments will be reluctant to reach the kind of deal that Boris Johnson recently did with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to play a key role in the expansion of the G network.One key result of the Covid crackdown has been to show businesses that it is perfectly possible for a signicant number of their employees to work from home, thanks to the web.This trend is bound to gather pace even when the crisis has passed.The huge increase in home working will herald a long-term decline in the office, for so long one of the symbols of our sophisticated civilisation.And the consequences of such a change will be enormous.Commercial property, which is estimated to be worth around £ billion in Britain, will drastically fall in value.Commuting by road or rail will become far less common, leaving trains emptier and roads less congested.For the first time since rail privatisation, passenger numbers will drop signicantly.Nor will there be any justication for huge, expensive transport projects like the £ billion HS rail link or the vast proposed new £ billion Lower Thames crossing, linking Kent and Essex by road.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.In a culture dominated by home working, expensive city living will lose much of its appeal.Already overblown, property bubbles in fashionable hotspots like London and Manchester could soon burst.Yet, while the urban housing market runs into deep trouble, coastal and rural regions may well see a revival.Will Margate be the new Islington On a more profound level, the shock of the present crisis will leave us more oriented towards our homes and family le.We will be less obsessed with eating out, more focused on home entertainment. TV streaming services will grow rapidly. Cinema chains will shrink.Hardly any area of British le will be free of the covid revolution’s impact.Throughout the academic world, there will be more respect for valuable, practical subjects like science, engineering and medicine - and less for academic pursuits like media studies.In politics, there is likely to be less partisanship and more consensus, as highlighted by the remarkable praise heaped last week on Mr Sunak by the TUC for his bailout.In a shell-shocked country, trying to recover from economic meltdown and social lockdown, there won’t be much time for isive fads, poisonous identity politics or invented victimhood.Shrieking about safe spaces will sound like pathetic self-indulgence in a society where thousands are likely to have died from the Corona killer.What could be beneficial for Britain is a fundamental rethink about the values of our age.The health crisis has graphically revealed who really matters when it comes to the le-and-death crunch.As the death toll mounts, it is not the property speculators, lawyers, quango chiefs, and hedge fund managers that keep our country going, despite their vast financial rewards.It is the NHS staff, the care home workers, the retail assistants, the emergency services personnel, the lorry drivers and the shelf-stackers, many of whom have limited earnings.Perhaps in the new Britain forged by the coronavirus, we will lavish more on our carers, and less on our celebrities.Out of the current despair, we may come to recognise our real priorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That figure includes  per cent of Conservative voters and  per cent of Labour voters.What’s more, only two per cent of the public said they don’t intend to follow the new rules.His personal favourability rating has skyrocketed too.So how has the Prime Minister achieved the type of public support that most leaders during any era of our history could only dream of Because he made it clear he was desperate not to impose these measures.We support Boris introducing draconian rule over our lives now because it’s obvious that doing so is his worst nightmare.He started slowly, initially allowing schools to stay open and football games to still be played based on scientic advice.But as the modelling changed and the threat to le became very real, our willingness to comply dramatically increased too.Only time will tellhe did too much too soon or too little too late. However, I am prepared to say on the record that the measured response was the right one.The British public, who have been brave enough to put their lives and ideology to one side, will be horried to learn that leaders within the Labour party have tried to snf out a political opportunity here.Labour party chairman Ian Lavery has been caught by the Guido Fawkes website plotting to use the coronavirus crisis as what he disgustingly calls a “great opportunity”.He said: “By the way when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour Party members, community champions out there a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it gets people together. We need to make sure that we do that, and community organising what a great opportunity it’s going to give us.”How revolting.The coronavirus pandemic is not a great political opportunity, Mr Lavery.It’s an international tragedy of epic proportions that will cause grief for many and economic catastrophe for years to come.It’s caused someone I know to lose a dear relative before their time. It’s caused weddings to be cancelled, jobs to be lost and le savings to go down the drain.It’s not a “great opportunity” for anyone – and Lavery should immediately apologise for such a smear.

But as the disease relentlessly spreads and deaths soar, it will not cope without a monumental national effort of a kind not seen for  years.The exhausted doctors and nurses on the frontline, dealing with stricken or recovering patients, now need the support of an army of , volunteers. If you are in good health and unable to work, why not join them It has been moving beyond measure to witness the , retired or former medics, nurses and pharmacists rejoining the NHS to fight this disease.They could be safe at home. Instead they have put themselves in harm’s way. That takes great courage and public spirit. MPs may not be popular these days, but those workers include Tory Maria Caulfield and Labour’s Dr Rosena Allin-Khan. We salute both.And we wish luck to the , final-year doctors and , student nurses who, at the very start of their careers, are tasked with tackling the gravest public health crisis in a century.They and all their colleagues should know, from the thousands of “I Love NHS” messages pouring into us from Sun readers, how grateful the nation is.Millions are doing their bit just by staying home. Many are going the extra mile to help friends, neighbours and OAPs who are self-isolating. Some, with their own jobs in peril, have poured money into good causes close to ruin.For their part, some of our businesses are repurposing factories to produce ventilators and other vital supplies.Now, the Government is asking every one of us to volunteer for the NHSwe can. Together we can help the health service beat this virus and restore some semblance of normality while minimising casualties. And it is desperately urgent.As the latest heartbreaking death toll shows, this crisis is likely to get much worse before it gets better. THE eerie, deserted streets tell their own story. Britain has begun to listen and obey.More than  million of us watched Boris Johnson’s stark, historic address to the nation — among the highest TV audience figures ever. And it hit home.Yes, there were still some crammed carriages on London’s depleted Tube yesterday. There is still confusion over some of the guidance and rules — and more clarity would be welcome.But there WILL be mistakes and inconsistencies from the Government.

We were high on euphoria and expectation before the inevitable responsibilities and occasional disappointments of adult le set in.For me, it meant a week in Tywyn, Wales, in the caravan of my friend Mandy’s mum and dad, followed by a summer job in Littlewoods and Sundays spent hanging around the local rec with my mates while passing round a warm, spittle-filled bottle of budget cider.Ah, those were the days. Today’s kids are more likely to be drinking canned Pinot Grigio at an American-style prom party before heading off on a family holiday to Spain, but the sense of closure they feel at the end of exams is exactly the same. It’s a rite of passage.So for all those GCSE and A-level students for whom Covid- has put paid to that “end of exams” feeling, I have nothing but the utmost sympathy.Last Wednesday I was on a dog walk with my youngestwhen news came in that her GCSEs were off.It’s tempting to think that she and the rest of Class  might have whooped with joy at this unprecedented cancellation of national exams, but that would be to sorely underestimate the level of pressure placed on their generation to get a qualication that will elevate them out of the in-tray of le and into paid employment.Like the Olympic athletes who’ve spent the past few years training for that one event in Tokyo that has been postponed until next year, our kids have been preparing for exams that their parents and teachers have drummed into them are so critically important to their future.So forgive them , despite the deaths that give perspective to the little things that many of us find frustrating about this plague on all our houses, they allow themselves a spell of feeling deeply sorry for themselves.They will now be given “predicted” grades — though the Government is still frustratingly vague on the exact detail of how they will be decided upon.There has been some suggestion that mock results might be a factor but, let’s face it, they’re rarely taken seriously at the time and never match the grades kids get in the real thing. So let’s hope they come up with something fairer.Either way, it’s going to be potentially fraught with pitfalls.“I wanted to earn my grades,” the youngest said, plaintively, the other day. “Now I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing.”I reassured her that, one day, knowledge such as “changes to Tanzania’s economy through private and foreign investment” , “the formation of polyesters through the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monomers and diol monomers”and “parallel and collinear vectors”might come in handy when, ten years from now, she’s at a pub quiz. Or maybe not.Which brings me to my final point on this unprecedented cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels.The latter are fine as they are, but perhaps those in the upper echelons of education could use this time of isolation to take a long, hard look at GCSEs and whether they are fit for purpose in the modern world Most kids know their subject strengths and weaknesses by the time they’re  so, aside from basic maths and English, which prove useful whatever your chosen employment, do they really need their heads crammed with often obscure information that,needed in later le, they could simply look up on Google Better, surely, to teach them vital le skills such as entrepreneurialism, money management, how to compose an impressive CV and do well in job interviews Like a reverse version of a minute’s silence, it’s to show our hard-working NHS staff how much we appreciate their efforts at this deeply challenging time.So whether you do it in a garden balcony windowbox or post it live on social media, put your hands together and show that we care about them too.MADONNA has posted an, er, inspirational Instagram video of herself ponticating on the Covid- plague while luxuriating in a bath full of rose petals.Her Madgeness declares: “That’s the thing about Covid-. It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.“It’s the great equaliser and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it.”Hmmmm. Nice sentiment, but the reality of self-isolation for the majority brings to mind the famous quote from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”Be it the Queen Of Pop, with her vast mansion and multi-million dollar nest egg to see her through these trying times, or The Queen with her “skeleton staff of eight” – being in lockdown is far nicer when you’re wealthy.But when there’s loads of you in a pokey space and with no discernible means of paying next month’s rent, it’s not so “great”. GOVERNMENT advice on who should be doing what and when is still a little woolly.And where there’s potential loopholes there are those who will either misunderstand or willfully exploit them.Step forward Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who, post-lockdown, told his staff they should turn up for work before being publicly shamed in to telling them to stay home after all.But with cycle shops being allowed to stay open, he could perhaps mitigate that as he’s in the business of sports equipment, he thought the same rule applied to his business too.­Similarly, while the building work on one house near me has ceased, another is still ongoing with at least eight construction workers – all of whom will have either shared a van or taken public transport to get there.So one suspects the Government is going to have to ramp up the “lockdown” rhetoric to make it clearer exactly what is deemed essential and what’s not.Meanwhile, I’m going to exploit this small pocket of vagueness by hopping on my bike and heading to the local pharmacy for a packet of hair dye, not least because it comes with a handy pair of disposable gloves.As the Donald Trump meme shows above, no one wants to see that much harsh reality.THE closure of McDonald’s prompted s of people to queue round the block for one last Big Mac.They shouldn’t worry.Given that a man in Utah claims to own the world’s oldest McDonald’s burgerand it shows no sign of decay.All those desperate McAddicts could have bought  of them and they’d still be edible at Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is not just for health workers, this is for the general population.“Over time we would expect a proportion of the population to test positive and that will allow them to get back to work.”Users or pharmacists will have to prick a finger and place a drop of blood on a stick, which looks like a home pregnancy test.Currently, Public Health England is only testing patients for Covid- in hospital with nasal swabs.This test only shows whether someone has the virus - and not whether they have already recovered from it.However, the new at-home test would revealsomeone has had the bug and built up immunity, and is therefore unlikely to catch it again.The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, explained the government would prioritise key workers - such as NHS staff - for the new antibody test.Explaining the process at the Downing Street press briefing tonight, he said: Once we’re confident of which tests will work and how many we have available to use, there’s a hierarchy of things that we need to do.We need to start off by answering that critical question - what proportion of people get this without any symptoms because that has big implications for the way we then manage this.Then we need to help make sure we can get NHS workers tested to make sure we can work out who is immune, or almost certainly immune, to this infection and who isn’t.We’ll basically go out in kind of a graded way from there.He added: I do not think - and I want to be clear - that this is something that we’ll be suddenly ordering on the internet next week.We need to go through the evaluation, then the first critical uses, and then spread it out from there.The NHS is also carrying out separate tests to seepeople currently have the virus, which are being given to patients in hospitals alongside some community sampling.Tap to see where COVID- is near youA Boots UK spokesperson told The Sun Online: “We are keen to work with the Government to explore opportunities to support Covid- testing and to support the NHS in any way we can.However we do not have any type of Covid- tests in our stores.Customers should not make a trip to a Boots store or pharmacy for this purpose.”Also during tonights briefing, Boris Johnson said the Government was massively ramping up testing for coronavirus as he announced that , people have now signed up as volunteers to help vulnerable people.He said it was hoped that very soon , tests would be carried out each day.Speaking at the daily press conference inside Number , he added that he wanted to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS.When we launched the appeal last night, we hoped to get , volunteers over a few days.But I can tell you that in just  hours, , people have responded to the call.That is already, in one day, as many volunteers as the population of Coventry.Prof Whitty also said there were shortages along many supply chains in the production of tests because every country in the world is simultaneously wanting this new thing.He added: Its not that there is no testing going on, what we need, clearly, is to be able to scale it up.Answering a question about how well the country was coping, Mr Johnson said that never in our history has the Government put its arms around people in the way we are doing now to help them get through this time.He added that a tailored package of support would be announced on Thursday to help self-employed people.The PM said: I do think when you look at the sheer scale of what the Government is doing to get this country through, we will cope and are coping very well indeed under the most challenging possible circumstances.To come out of it well together as I know we can, we all need to follow the instructions the Government have given and to stay at home, protect the NHS and thats the way to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Lots of people will have had very mild, or in some cases no symptoms, so it is possible that people have had it without knowing. Unfortunately we don’t have enough testing to know how many people have had it.Q: What is the dference between coronavirus and hay fever symptoms A: Hay fever symptoms are usually itchy, red eyes and, for people who have asthma, some get wheezing. It can also cause a runny, itchy or bunged-up nose. Coronavirus can cause people with asthma to have wheezing but the two main symptoms of the virus are a dry, persistent cough that is new and a high fever. Despite its name, hay fever does not cause a fever.Q: What are the guidelines regarding bedding and towels when you are in self-isolation A: If someone is in self-isolation because they are showing symptoms of the virus they should use their own bedding, pillows, towels and toiletriesthey live with other people. People should also use their own cutlery and crockery. They should visit the bathroom last and clean hard surfaces with a household bleach product.Q: My daughter and her partner are key workers on shts and are struggling to arrange childcare. Is it safe to look after my grandchildren A: If you are over  you should avoid looking after your grandchildrenpossible because older people are more vulnerable and because children can carry and transmit the virus without having symptoms.Q: I’m a care worker and also a carer for my disabled husband, who has heart failure and is on immunosuppressant medication. He has been told by the Government to isolate for  weeks. Do I have to stop work and isolate as well in case I catch the virus from work A: Your husband is in the high-risk group and needs to keep a physical distance from everybody . As you are a care worker, you will be coming into contact with other people but because you are living together you don’t need to self-isolate unless you get symptoms. You still need to care for your husband and you cannot always keep a two-metre distance from him.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: I live alone and have had the virus symptoms. I have been self-isolating for seven days. When is it safe to stop self-isolating A: If you live alone, the seven-day self- isolation period begins the day your symptoms start. If after seven days, your symptoms have gone and you are well, you can carry on as normal, evenyou still have a cough. Butyou still feel unwell, you must stay at home until you feel completely better.Q: What is the best way to protect our mental health during lockdown  I have a family member constantly crying and who has locked herself in her room.A: It’s understandable and normal that people feel like your family member. It’s a worrying time for everybody. But it is important to remember the virus is usually a mild illness. Most people will recover. If you find watching the news upsetting then I would advise switching it off and finding something that makes you feel more relaxed and happy, such as listening to your favourite music, getting out in your garden or doing some exercise, which releases happy hormones. You can also call a friend as it can help to share your anxiety.Q: My partner is seven months pregnant and I suffer from asthma, plus we have a two-year-old daughter with breathing problems. We are self-isolating but when should I go back to work  I can’t work from home.A: Your partner is in the vulnerable group and should be staying at home, as should your daughter. You have asthma so you should be staying at home unless it is very controlled. If your asthma is at all frequent, you should not be going to work.Q: I have no cough or temperature but I am suffering fatigue, shortness of breath and have lost my sense of taste. Someone told me these are still symptoms of the virus. Is this true A: For those who have very mild symptoms of coronavirus, some have only experienced a loss of sense of taste and smell. That is not a reason to self-isolate, though. It could be down to an allergy or an ordinary cold.Q: I am due to go for an MRI next week for prostate cancer. I am , wheelchair-bound and have other problems. Is it safe for me to go Q: I work at Royal Mail as a sorter and work closely with colleagues. Now the coronavirus is spreading fast, should I stay at home A: Physical distancing is key to anyone who still remains at work. Your work is important and as long as you are not too close to your colleagues there is no reason why you cannot continue.Think of all the people working in hospitals, at  call centres and all the paramedics seeing patients. They have to work together with many other colleagues, but they will physically distance themselves as much as possible and that’s all we can ask them to do.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has just taken this crisis to give us all a wake-up call to realise what is most important — our family, our friends and our fellow human beings.In my street we have set up a WhatsApp group so we can all help each other out getting shopping, medicine and simply checking to seeeveryone, especially the elderly and those living alone, are doing OK.And tens of thousands of you have heeded the Government’s call and volunteered to help deliver medicines and supplies to vulnerable patients on lockdown.I have signed up to have a chat with anyone who needs a bit of reassurance.Cab drivers are giving pensioners free transport. LA Taxis in Newcastle picked up dozens of elderly people to take them to the local supermarket and back home again with their essentials.Our youngsters have also been amazing.James Burnett, , from Grimsby, set up a Facebook group to connect people who want to help — and thousands have joined.He has also been taking sandwiches to his local hospital with sister Ellie-Mae, , and brothers Robbie, six and Oscar, four. I know hungry NHS workers enduring gruelling long shts are so grateful to these big-hearted youngsters.It truly brings a tear to my eye and I am so proud of all these thoughtful acts.To raise my spirits, I go for a daily walk with my little dog Angus. I do not see as many people as usual — and I obviously keep a safe distance from any I do — but I have seen a real change in attitude.Everyone now shouts a cheery greeting or exchanges a rueful smile and wave.There is a real sense of us all being in this together.Like many of you, I have been feeling anxious and unsettled, but focusing on the positives has been keeping me sane.YOU are our heroes daily!!! Thank you!!! We love you.KURT RIEMERYOU’RE all truly amazing.SOPHIA GODWINMaybe, just maybe, all of these small but important acts of kindness and that renewed and revitalised community spirit will continue when the virus has been defeated.

What matters most is we get money to those who need it the most as quickly as we can”.Better off earners are instead judged to have nest eggs tucked away that they can delve into for short-term support.Five million Brits - almost one in six of the workforce - work for themselves.Some . million of them have already been left out of pocket by the crisis, the Resolution Foundation think-tank warned yesterday.But until the brand new system is up and running, they will be asked to go on Universal Credit.The Chancellor will also highlight how he last week hiked the job support element of the benefit to £ a week, as well as point to the series of other emergency reliefs he has put in place, including deferring VAT, mortgage holidays, scrapping business rates and free loans for businesses.Insiders also yesterday claimed the new self-employed bailout has been “incredibly dficult” to set up, and there were also serious concerns about designing a system that took away the incentive to work.Mr Johnson also told MPs yesterday that the Government will “put our arms around every worker” to help them during the unprecedented crisis.He told PMQs: “As a society and a country we’re doing a quite extraordinary thing.“For the first time in our history, to get through this crisis, we’re putting our arms as a country around every single worker, every single employee in this country.“It is a quite unprecedented step. I know there are concerns about the self-employed, but he’ll be hearing more in the next couple of days from the Chancellor.”The Chancellor last week launched an all-out bid to save millions of jobs by promising to pay  per cent of the wages of staff kept on the books.And the PM hinted today’s bailout for Britain’s five million self-employed will be on a similar scale, saying he wants “parity” of support.Mr Sunak also extended the one year business rates holiday to all firms forced to close for the coronavirus lockdown.That means estate agents, hairdressers, furniture stores, sports shops and other businesses forced to shut down for at least three weeks will pay no rates until April .It is an extension of the one-year business rates holiday handed to retailers, pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and travel agents in last week’s announcement.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Depending on their exact form, some might be able to be administered without leaving home. Prof Peacock said patients could eventually get the test delivered from Amazon or by visiting Boots to showthey have immunity. But Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned people wonapost simply be able to order them next week.  He said they must be rolled out in a graded way with NHS staff and key workers being tested for immunity first - and while carefully gathering data on what proportion of the population might be immune. Prof Whitty said: “I do not think, and I want to be clear, that this is something we’ll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week. “We need to go through the evaluation, then the first critical uses, and then spread it out from that point of view. We need to do that in a systematic way.” The tests are designed to establish whether people have previously been infected with coronavirus, as opposed to antigen tests which showsomeone has the virus as they areexperiencing symptoms of COVID-, the disease caused by the coronavirus.These are brand new products.

Once they have been tested, and that will happen this week, once the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community, she said, adding that the they could be delivered via Amazon. Testing the test is a small matter, and I would anticipate that it would be done by the end of this week. She said there were ious dferent models, and some might might require people to go to a high street chemist.  Prof Peacock said she thought any charge for the tests would be minimal and though she declined to say they would be available by next week, she confirmed that they would be ready in days rather than weeks or months. Asked when they would be rolled out more widely she cautioned: “I think I would be somewhat less categorical about the date.  “But in the near future people will be able to order a test that they can test themselves, or go to Boots or somewhere similar to have their finger prick test done.” She told MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee the finger-prick test “looks like a pregnancy test”, but using a drop of blood. She added: “.million have been ordered and further millions are being ordered today. “But we do need to make sure we understand how they operate because these are brand new tests, they haven’t been used by us before.”  Prof Peacock explained: “We are developing home testing so people who have been sick can be tested for the presence of antibodies.  “So thatthey’re positive, they can then go out and go back to work.” She said they will be rolled out into the community once PHE are sure they work. She added: ”These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do.

A minister moved to clary after NHS staff hit out, asking why the Prince of Wales was tested for Covid- when they are not. Clarence House said the -year-old heir to the throne had mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health. Yet NHS staff with mild or even severe, non-hospital symptoms have been struggling to get tested. Apart from in the early days of the outbreak, testing has been focused on cases which are already in hospital with tests few and far between in the wider community. Downing Street refused to comment yesterday on the Prince of Walesapos case. But today Health Minister Edward Argar claimed the royalaposs symptoms did qualy him getting tested. Mr Argar told Sky News: My understanding is that his symptoms, his condition, met that criteria. He added: The Prince of Wales didnapost jump the queue. But he did not say why or how that was the case, due to patient confidentiality. Mr Argar said: Iaposm not going to comment on the Prince of Wales medical care or his particular position because thataposs an inidual case. Iaposm not going to comment on anyoneaposs inidual case.  The government has promised to ramp up testing of live Covid- cases from , per day to , per day by the end of April. Meanwhile, the government has ordered .million antibody tests to seesomeone has had Covid-, recovered, and developed immunity.The antibody tests have not yet been approved but work is ongoing to test them in an Oxford lab by the end of this week. Eventually the antibody kits may be available on Amazon or Boots - but the Chief Medical Officer stressed theyaposll be rolled out to critical cases, NHS staff and key workers first. Mr Argar said: We are focused on making sure we ramp up those tests around the country for our frontline workers. There is a signicant national effort under way to do that.  Iaposm not going to go into any further details about his Royal Highness save that Iaposm sure everyone would wish him and anyone  with this virus well. Likely contagious since March , the day after he last saw his mum the Queen, the Prince of Wales, , developed symptoms over the weekend but otherwise remains in good health. The heir to the throne met hundreds of people during a high number of engagements in recent weeks - where he offered namaste gestures instead of handshakes - but it is not possible to ascertain where he caught the virus, his spokesman said.  Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, , has tested negative for coronavirus and is self-isolating with her husband at their ,-acre Birkhall estate in Scotland, although they are apart from each other at the residence. NHS staff hit out yesterday on social media. Doctor Naveed @MedicSeditious wrote: Why am I refused a test after seeing patients with covid infections and Prince Charles or any celebrity can get a test within seconds  We’re playing Russian roulette with minimal protection leaving behind our families who are constantly worryingwe’re still alive every night. GP Alex Gates tweeted: I think we can all join together in wishing Prince Charles all the very best in his fight with mild suspected coronavirus symptoms which isn’t confirmed because he’s not eligible for a test because he has mild symptoms.... oh. No. Wait... it... is  Confirmed  I see. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said Boris Johnson was informed about the Prince of Walesapos positive test result on Wednesday morning and he wishes the prince a speedy recovery.

The death of -year-old Chloe Middleton is a reminder that all ages are at risk. Our thoughts are with her family. We also wish the Prince a speedy recovery. The heir to the throne was one of the lucky ones who has been able to receive a test. Our concern is the delay in rolling out a testing regime for NHS staff and care workers. Boris Johnson says he hopes to have widespread testing available as quickly as possible. The Prime Minister has yet to explain why Britain has been so slow to act when other countries such as South Korea have been aggressively testing for the bug. Germany has the capacity to test , people a week. The UK has tested just , since the virus first appeared on our shores. It looks like no coincidence that Germany has reported more cases of the coronavirus than Britain but has lower mortality rate.  Ministers also need to explain why it is taking so long to provide personal protection equipment to NHS and care workers. Without masks, gloves and sanitisers these frontline workers are putting themselves and their patients at risk. The Government is asking all of us to do our bit to help the country through this crisis. Inwe expect it to play its part by providing NHS staff with the equipment they need and to rapidly expand the testing programme. Clap for heroes  When the call went out for volunteers to support the NHS in its hour of need some thought it would go unanswered. Instead people have responded in their hundreds of thousands. This same spirit has also seen more than , former doctors and nurses come out of retirement to help the NHS. Everyone who does so knows they could be putting their own le at risk in order to save the lives of others.

In Stoke-on-Trent, nine people tested positive for coronavirus as of Tuesday, and  in Staffordshire.However, StokeonTrentLive reports that the numbers could be even higher due to limited testing.Dr Richard Harling, the Director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council is chairing the Strategic Coordinating Group, which is overseeing the multi-agency response, said: “Everyone is now aware that we are facing a unique challenge, with the Government addressing the nation on a daily basis.Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror“Declaring a Major Incident now is a way of making sure all public sector agencies and our partners can work together, share resources where necessary, and better anticipate and deal with challenges. “It is something we prepare for and practice regularly. It does not confer any special powers or change the roles of the dferent organisations involved. “This is a sensible step as we know from other countries that dealing with Coronavirus COVID- is going to take time and persistence. “Pooling resources is important because we know we will face challenges, particularly the likelihood that more staff will be self-isolating in the coming weeks and that will strain resources. We will be better able to do things jointly, such as and informing people in relation to any particular localised issues. “Working together is something that we do all the time in Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent and the action we are now taking is simply aimed at making that process even more joined-up. “It is important that people continue following the advice from Public Health England and the Government.”  Two pieces of emergency legislation - the Coronavirus Act  and the Contingencies Fund Act  - have been granted royal assent, as the government continues to tackle the pandemic.In his daily briefing Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country is coping “very well” in the face of the “most challenging circumstances”.Replying to a question about how well the country was coping, Mr Johnson said that “never in our history has the Goverment put its arms around people in the way we are doing now to help them get through this time”. He added that a tailored package of support would be announced on Thursday to help self-employed people.

Social care staff and health service volunteers will also be exempt from parking charges. The Government has been under intense pressure to waive parking fees for NHS workers this week, with , people signing a petition calling for them to be scrapped. Yesterday, Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan said he would pay the fines of any public health-care worker ticketed while at work. NHS Trusts set their own parking charges, but the Government will now cover the cost of any income lost from daily fees paid by staff, the Department of Health said.Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@trinitymirrorFrontline workers will also be able to use council parking bays without time restriction or charge, Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has promised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Our NHS is facing an unprecedented challenge, and I will do everything I can to ensure our dedicated staff have whatever they need during this unprecedented time. So we will provide free car parking for our NHS staff who are going above and beyond every day in hospitals across England. My enormous gratitude goes out to the many NHS Trusts and other organisations already providing free car parking and I urge other Trusts to do the same with our backing. We will do what is needed to protect the NHS, support our health and care staff, and save lives as we tackle Covid-.  The new free parking on council land for health workers, social care workers and NHS volunteers will apply to all on-street parking and open, council-run car parks including pay and display. Mr Jenrick said councils will set up arrangements so those eligible can provide suitable evidence to display in their windscreen and avoid a ticket. Our NHS staff and social care workers are working round the clock to save lives and should not have to worry about the cost or time restrictions of parking, Mr Jenrick said. Private company the National Car Parking Group has also said it will provide NHS staff free parking at all  of its sites in England. Ministers are now urging other businesses and organisations located near hospitals to work with their local NHS Trusts to consider allowing NHS staff use of their car parks.

A ray of hope for the world has come in early evidence from China showing infection rates do not appear to have surged despite people being allowed to travel again. However, experts told MPs that Brits will only be allowed outside againthe Government made more virus tests available. They expect the outbreak here to peak in three weeks. British scientists are among those scrutinising data out of the country where the pandemic emerged in Wuhan in December, the city has been in lockdown since January but restrictions were loosened this week. It comes after a separate study by Oxford University suggested many more Brits may have been infected but developed no symptoms. The optimistic modelling theory suggests the virus was circulating in the UK by mid-January, around two weeks before the first reported case here. If true it would mean more than half of the population are likely to have had Covid- and be immune to it. China is ahead of all other countries and spread of the disease there has slowed signicantly. Mass gatherings are still banned. Author Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, who is advising the UK government, said: “This provides hope for countries currently in ious levels of lockdown.” It was not all good news though as a separate study warned that China can expect a second wave of infections by August after it lted restrictions in Hubei province. Peer-reviewed modelling published in the Lancet Public Health journal found that delaying reopening schools and workplaces a month until April would delay the second wave from hitting until October.

Dr Kiesha Prem, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The measures the city of Wuhan has put in place have helped to control the outbreak. However, the city now needs to be careful to avoid prematurely lting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak.” The UK is currently only testing a fth of the , daily checks promised by Boris Johnson last week and lags behind other countries such as South Korea, Germany, Italy and Norway.  Prof Ferguson, who is recovering from Covid- himself, told MPs yesterday via video link that any lting of restrictions would require widespread testing. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s Chief Scientic Officer, told MPs: “I wish we had more tests available.” Prof Sharon Peacock, of Public Health England, admitted the , daily test total will not be hit until the “end of April”. Prof Ferguson, expects transmission to be reduced in the summer months by %-%. The only long term “exit strategy” from current lockdown is the development of a vaccine, which could take between  and  months.  The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, has said that it needs extra cash from governments for eight vaccine candidates in development. But Prof Andrew Pollard, of Oxford University, told MPs: ““I believe that six months is possible but it needs a lot of things to fall in place so that this process goes well.” Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford, said: “We need to begin mass antibody testing to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in.” The government has purchased . million antibody tests, which could tellsomeone has ever had Covid-, and they will be kept at a centre in Milton Keynes, Bucks.

Michelle Carney is a Tough Mudder ambassador and regularly runs k races, but the -year-old has been told to self-isolate by NHS Direct  who said they strongly believed she has coronavirus after she developed a dry cough and a fever.Testing is only being carried out in hospitals so she will not receive confirmation that she has Covid- .  The mum-of-two, who is self-isolating for with her daughters, says she has experienced the full list of coronavirus  symptoms but has also revealed other lesser-known symptoms, Hull Live reports.Ms Carney, who is asthmatic but otherwise fit and well, described a feeling like a “weight inside my lungs” and them itching from the “inside”. “The air seems to cause a cold burning feeling to my lungs - similar toyou breath in cold air after a strong mint but about  times worse,” she said. “The worst part though is that the air seems to strip my lungs and airways of all moisture. My lungs, throat and eyes feel unbelievably dry. Water helps for a matter of seconds but then the dryness instantly s. Strangely as my breathing has started to improve the dry feeling has become worse. “I am drinking extraordinary amounts of water each day but I still constantly feel a though my lungs have been left outside in a desert for weeks. “The symptoms I haven’t seen people mention on the TV include that my lungs itch so badly on the inside. They feel like there is a weight inside my lungs. “My airways just feel so dry. I’ve drunk eight or nine pints of water today and I’m still thirsty.”  Michelle says she has spoken to NHS Direct on a number of occasions and that they have deemed it likely that she has the virus. However, she has stayed away from hospitals meaning she has not been tested. Her symptoms began  days ago as a “mild cough” – just a day after completing a k with no signs of illness - before it accelerated into a fever last Monday. “This time last week I wouldn’t have been capable of having this conversation,” she said while speaking to Hull Live. “My temperature was in the high s.

The Duchess of Sussex is living in Canada with Prince Harry and their son Archie, and it sounds like there might be a new member of the family soon.She told pals she and Harry were originally looking at a three-month-old mixed breed puppy called Panda, but theyaposve now got their heart set on a four-year-old black Labrador called Cole. Itaposs believed they are particularly keen on him as heaposs known to be great with kids, making him the perfect play pal for little Archie.  A source told the Daily Mail : Meghan said they have plenty of space and it wouldnapost be a problem.She also joked that fostering meant keeping. However, itaposs not believed the couple have actually contacted the shelter or started the process yet. The Sussex family already have three rescue dogs - a Labrador-shepherd mix called Bogart, Guy the Beagle and a black Lab, believed to be called Oz. However Bogart lives in LA with Meghanaposs mum as he was too old to move to London with the Duchess.  Itaposs understood that they are looking to foster through the Victoria Humane Society, which has a cute bio on Cole on their website. It says: Cole !!! Two year old, housetrained and sweet! Cuddles like crazy. He loves to play with his foster brothers, one big, one small, and thinks kids are the greatest thing in the world! Four yr olds and up have been around him and he is fantastic with them.  He is very nervous with new people, and in new situations tends to tuck tail and sit, but once he knows he is safe and gets used to being with you, he is your best friend. He does believe that your bed is his soyour not willing to share he is definitely not the dog for you! He loves to give hugs and is very attentive to his people, he loves to go for walks is great on his leash and is fantastic in the car.

He said: The main reason for moving into the campervan is one member of my household while I was away became symptomatic. Given the state of how busy we are I didnapost think that sitting at home for two weeks would be the best use of my time. I thought it was more advantageous to isolate myself temporarily. Instead he decided to move into the campervan so that he could continue working for the South East Coast Ambulance service , where he is based in Polegate, East Sussex. We come into contact with patients who potentially have the coronavirus on a daily basis - whether that is the potential to have it or those who are confirmed as having Covid-. I wanted to put that step forward and protect my family.  I may not have symptoms but there is nothing to say I wonapost pass it on to my family. Mr Hughes also thanked the public for their support while he and colleagues are busy dealing with the coronavirus. It has been very positive overall, the public are very supportive of the ambulance service paramedics and of the NHS as a whole. However, he also called on people to obey Government guidance so that the NHS is not overrun with Covid- cases. I have witnessed the effects of the virus and would urge members of the public to read the latest Government advice.

Jade Edgington was just six months away from her big day when the groom-to-be had a change of heart and shattered her dream of a fairytale ending. The business development manager spent the summer of  holidaying to take her mind off the break-up but her desire to be a mum never went away. After being diagnosed with polycystic oy syndrome, the -year-old knew her chances of conceiving naturally were slim and that sheaposd need IVF one day.  Jade, from Birmingham, West Mids, then made the bold decision to become a single parent with the help of IVF and a sperm donor.She says her le is now aposcompleteapos after giving birth to Eden last year on July .Jade says: I had known for a few years I had polycystic oy syndrome which meant that my oies had a lot of cysts all over them.My then partner seemed to be on the exact same wave and spoke about children and marriage from the very start. I felt like everything I had ever been waiting for was coming true. Until he randomly texted me to say he didnapost want to be with me - my entire world came crashing down.But that didnapost stop me from wanting to become a mum and it was the best decision I have ever made.I donapost have any regrets about doing this on my own and I feel like she has made me into the person I was always supposed to be.Jade was initially thrilled when her ex popped the question - nine months into their relationship and the pair went on to book their wedding for July . Jade recalls being on cloud nine in aposcoocoo landapos when booking her dream honeymoon to Thailand and Bali.But as the six month countdown approached, Jadeaposs ex-fiancee got cold feet. She said: He just changed his mind, as simple as that but kept me hanging for six weeks until he made his mind up about wanting to be with me or not.I was on a shoestring just wanting him to love me. I was distraught and genuinely broken.I put on a brave face when at work or with my friends and family but when I got home, I would sob and sob.But eventually I realised I deserve to be with someone who wants to be with me.I wasnapost willing to put myself into that situation ever again nor wait another few months or years to meet aposthe oneapos.I was still focussed on becoming a mum, evenit meant doing it alone. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence fertility guidelines it is broadly recognised that single women are not eligible for IVF on the NHS.After thorough research, she found a clinic in Northern Spain and her journey to motherhood began.She adds: It was such a big decision and I had no idea where to find a clinic that is going to be the best at sucking my eggs out and sticking them back in fertilised!A friend had been to a dferent clinic in Spain but the country seemed to have higher success rates and was much cheaper.I found Manzanera Fertility Clinic in Northern Spain, and had my consultation via Skype in August [].I didnapost want to feel under pressure so I decided to keep it a secret from everyone but my dad Brian, , who accompanied me to to the clinic in October .Jade forked out £, of her savings to pay for IVF and she was able to get IVF medication in the UK.The clinic matched her characteristics to a sperm donoraposs to ensure her baby looked like her.She had three eggs fertilised but a pregnancy test two weeks later revealed one had stuck.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Do you keep the players ticking over on their own or rest “The most important thing, though, is the health of everybody – as a club we are doing everything to look after our players and our staff, that’s paramount.“There’s not many times when I’ll say football isn’t important but it isn’t right now.”The Dundee players have been given inidual training programmes to work on at home but, with government advice to stay indoors as much as possible, it’s not easy for some.“As a club we have set up inidual programmes for the players but the trouble with that is a lot of the work is on treadmills or exercise bikes and not everyone has access to them,” added the Dens boss.“Otherwise you’re asking them to go out and do bits in the park and the advice is now not really to do that.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility.

It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat.

insisting that people were complying with the Governmentrsquos social distancing advice by keeping two metres away from others while visiting the scenic coast and getting exercise.One said on Facebook:ldquoIt wasnrsquot mass gatherings at that beach, there was literally no one near anyone.Another added:ldquoWide open spaces like a beach are a great place to get fresh air and exercise while also adhering to social distancing rules, exactly as the Government and chief medical officer advises.It was also suggestedthat it was much easier to keep two metres away from others on a beach than in a shop.It is understood that the council faces a practicle issue about physically closing the car parks, which do not have barriers.East Lothian Council scrapped plans to introduce barriers when it

Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.

It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

So far, so Bonfire of the Vanities. The teen starts to work her way into the older womanrsquos le and, long story short, offers to be a surrogate infor pound,.Dan thinks this is a crazy idea, not to mention illegal. As does his sister, his lawyer, Emilyrsquos colleague, and probably every viewer watching. Many a drama would struggle to get beyond such a point, but the writer here is Nicole Taylor , who carefully takes each objection and picks away at it.: Susan Swarbrick meets Martin CompstonUltimately, the viewer has to believe that Emily is unhinged by grief, and that Dan would give in because he is desperate to keep her. Madness happens when people convince themselves a situation is all or nothing, black or white. That is how noir works.Even so, Taylorrsquos story is such a high-wire act that it needs to keep propelling itself onwards at speed or it will crash to the ground in a heap of improbabilities.Helping immensely with the task of keeping the viewer on side is a terric cast. Rundle is a convincing mix of fierce determination and eggshell fragility. Mack, a real find, does that bravest of things as an actor and makes herself an unlikeable pain in the neck.Then there is Compston. Once the prince of Sunday nights as Essex wide boy DS Arnott in Line of Duty, he is even better back on his home turf and in his own accent.It was a nice touch by Taylor to make Dan a bad boy made good, eventhe working class middle class contrast was laid on a a bit thick.

As reassurance goes, it lacked a certain rigour. How often have teenagers told their mum or dad ldquonot to worry when they were neglecting their homework, or spending the small hours who knows where, doing who knows what  Did that lower their blood pressure one iota Up and down the country, the tables have been turned. If this were the era of switchboards, operators could tap into millions of lines and hear the increasingly anxious voices of the middle-aged trying to get their stubborn and defensive old ones to see sense.The problem is, the over-seventies are exceptionally proud of retaining their independence. They bridle at any hint of being past it or not capable of looking after themselves. In normal circumstances this is a healthy mindset, fending off the reality of advancing years and the worry of one day becoming a burden. How many magazine features have you read reporting that  is the new , and weightlting and running are essential to stave off premature rigor mortis  Until the past fortnight, all those who remember rationingand were carrying on asthey were mere striplings were viewed as marvels and inspirations. Now, their gung-ho, can-do spirit has to be put on hold, forced into hibernation for however long this blight lasts. I donrsquot envy any son or daughter reminding their mother or father of their vulnerability, and urging them to take seriously the mortal threat that lies beyond the gate.To see children laying down the law is yet another example of a world gone bananas. You could call it pay-back. Did any of us manage to get through adolescence without coming under constant sniper attack  Most parents griped and girned until their hair turned grey. In our household you could set the clock by the raised voices chivvying us to get out to school, or turn down the radio, or help with the washing up. The small print of parent-child contracts includes the adultrsquos right to scold, ponticate and nag as often as required. Juniorrsquos side of the bargain makes no provision for reasoned argument, protest or rebellion. It states simply that they must unquestioningly obey, preferably for all time.The irony of policing onersquos parents behaviour doesnrsquot make this any easier. But perhaps therersquos a frisson of satisfaction in being able to exact revenge on those who spent the best years of their lives hectoring and carping. Could it feel like a righting of old wrongs to chastise dad for his recklessness, or ask a -year-old to grow up when she suggests an SAS-style dawn-raid on the supermarket It is especially satisfying, surely, that the role reversal necessary to reinforce these new rules is done in the name of commonsense and caring. When the point of the exercise is to protect the lives of those you love, in terms of moral high ground itrsquos up there with Macchu Pichu. What possible riposte can anyone give when urged to take precautions not just to safeguard yourself, but those closest to you Yet as most handbooks to raising a family suggest, nagging is futile. It sets up a vicious circle of resentment and rebellion, and makes the one being chastised feel sore. When people are lectured, they switch off, mentally reaching for the headphones until the tone of voice improves. Whether yoursquore  or , that never changes. So, as a mass technological revolution is rolled-out, with elderly luddites being all but forcibly initiated into the art of video calling, more trouble lies ahead.In an old-fashioned phone conversation, finger-wagging offspring canrsquot see their loved ones rolling their eyes, putting an invisible gun to their temples, or mouthing ldquoGive me a break!. But as soon as they can observe the impact their words are having itrsquoll be like travelling back in time. Theyrsquoll see these beloved faces taking on an unfamiliar juvenile expression: sullen irritation, avoidance of eye contact, nail-biting, fidgeting, a huffily shrugged shoulder.The longer these virus vigilantes bang on, the less response theyrsquoll get. The age-old aria between adult and adolescent is an unequal contest: a torrent of words in one corner, mutinous monosyllables in the other. I donrsquot doubt for a moment that most older folk will pay heed to their familyrsquos concerns.

It should be stated that the entire world is in the very early stage of developing such strategies.\"Prof Ferguson added countries were looking to China, which was lting its lockdown, to see what would happen next but stressed: \"The long-term exit from this is clearly the hopes around a vaccine.\"Elsewhere, the BMA warned that doctors and patients would die without adequate personal protective equipment[PPE] across the NHS.It said doctors were risking serious illness and death due to a lack of stock and it claimed many more could go off sick unless immediate steps are taken.The association said there was \"growing evidence that thousands of GPs and hospital staff are still not being provided with the kit they need to properly protect themselves and their patients\", despite Government assurances.However, Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, has said millions of pieces of PPE have been sent out in recent days and a hotline has been set up so staff can report where there are shortages.Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy CMO also insisted on Wednesday there was enough PPE available for all.But the BMA said it had heard accounts of no stock, very small amounts of PPE, rationing and kit that did not offer sufficient protection.In other developments ndash*Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said the international community would work together to face the \"unprecedented challenge\" of getting stranded citizens home during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Chancellor is expected to unveil his new measures at the daily Downing St briefing.During a less populated and less pugnacious Prime Ministerrsquos Questions than usual, Mr Johnson referred to ldquoparity of support for the self-employed, who include an estimated , people living and working in Scotland.He stressed there were ldquoparticular complexities about how to help them, which needed to be addressed.\"They are not all in the same position and all I can say is that we are working as fast as we possibly can to get the appropriate package of support for everybody in this country,\" explained the PM.Earlier, during Scottish Questions, Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, revealed the Chancellor had been looking at many schemes ldquoacross the EU and around the world to see how best to help the self-employed.During PMQs, Mr Johnson insisted the Government would do ldquoabsolutely everything it takes to beat the virus and get the country through to the other side, telling MPs: ldquoAs a society and as a country we are doing a quite extraordinary thing for the first time in our history to get through this crisis, we are putting out arms as a country around every single worker, every single employeehellipand it is a quite unprecedented step.Later at the daily Downing St press conference, he referred to how ldquonever in our history has the Government put its arms around people in the way we are doing now to help them get through this dficult time.In the Commons, Ian Blackford for the SNP called for the Government to support all the countryrsquos workers and told the PM: ldquoHe said the UK is putting its arms around all our workers, I hope that that will become the case because as of today, its not.\"This morning, the Resolution Foundation estimated that one in three people in self-employment, a total of .m workers, are now at risk of losing their income. In Scotland, that means , self-employed people are deeply concerned about the jobs and the families they support.\"The Highland MP emphasised how opposition parties wanted to work with the Government on the issue of help for the self-employed but he said there was ldquofrustration because weve gone into lockdown and workers are without income this is an emergency\".He continued: \"As we stand here, people are losing their incomes. Telling them to wait another day simply isnt good enough.\"Mr Blackford asked: \"Can the Prime Minster confirm that when the Chancellor eventually does announce measures, there will be parity and equality of support between the already announced jobs retention scheme and the new scheme for the self-employed  They must not be left behind Prime Minister.\"Mr Johnson said the SNP leader was making a very important point and declared: ldquoI totally share his desire to get parity of support.\"But, again, he pointed out: \"There are particular dficulties with those who are not on PAYE schemes ashellipthe whole House understands. We are bringing forward a package to ensure that everybody gets the support that they need.\"Jeremy Corbyn, appearing at his last PMQs as Labour leader, also raised the issue of the self-employed in relation to construction workers and pointed out how building sites were \"still operating, still working on non-emergency work despite the new rules\" as he referenced a radio call from a self-employed construction worker who said he had contracted coronavirus but had \"no other option but to get on the London tube and go onto a site to work\".He urged: \"Can the PM be absolutely clear and give unequivocal guidance now that construction work on non-emergency work should stop now \"In response, Mr Johnson said: \"Everybody should work at home unless they must go to work\", adding: \"If a...construction company is continuing, then clearly they should do so in accordance with the guidance of Public Health England.\"The PM stressed: \"But what were not doing, and this is fully in accordance with the scientic and medical advice, what were not doing is closing down the whole UK economy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-thankful-true-leaders-stepping-plate","story":"A lot of these experts lurk on Twitter, sometimes using their own names and sometimes not, but always available to tell us why either Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeonare appallingly mismanaging the Coronavirus pandemic and putting us all at risk.Fortunately, my Twitter timeline is not real le. Although it can be challenging to retain a sense of perspective on this, the people using the coronavirus to advance partisan politics constitute a small proportion of the population.Indeed, in an unexpected triumph for the mainstream media, the coronavirus outbreak could precipitate a setback for the world of blogs, user-created and socially-shared news, which has shown itself to be partisan, hysterical and, at worst, highly dangerous in its rank inaccuracy.The broadsheet newspapers, in particular, and broadcast news, have excelled themselves. In Scotland, I would highlight this newspaper, The Herald, along with the Scotsman, the Times, the Courier and the Press  Journal as exemplars of good content, good contributors and good tone. STVrsquos Scotland Tonight has been excellent, and it is a great pity that the impact of the virus is forcing it to go weekly rather than nightly, from tonight onwards. And the BBC, despite the mix of UK and Scottish content being confusing when the UK Government and Scottish Government erge, is doing a signicantly better job of managing the range of views on Coronavirus than it has on other dominant issues such as Brexit.What most of the mainstream media has successfully portrayed is what the world of blogs and social media cannot see because of their blinding bias: that Scotland has two leaders in Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon who, although of dfering styles, are both of high intelligence and high analytical ability, and who have shown themselves able to be both decisive and nimble in the most dramatic circumstances.Those who read the last paragraph and roll their eyes are, Irsquom afraid, the people who can open their eyes but cannot see. YouGov has polled regularly since the start of the crisis, showing high approval ratings both for Mr Johnson and the UK Governmentrsquos actions, and I am certain that Scottish polling would reveal the same in favour of Ms Sturgeon.Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon are in the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis. Ms Sturgeon said, at the outset of this pandemic, that she has ldquonever cared less about party politics, and I have no doubt that this genuine sentiment is shared by Mr Johnson. It is impossible to understand both the scale of their challenge and the burden placed on them as the iniduals at the top of the tree. Iniduals, let us remember, who are not just leaders, but people. People with parents in the at-risk group, withrelatives in the NHS, and witha pregnant fiancee.Although they will both be emotionally and physically exhausted, we as citizens expect them to be able to make lucid decisions about an existential issue which will shape the rest of our lives. Yes, they have ministers, advisers and experts around them, but as the people in the office history will pass sentence on them as iniduals. Not since Sir Winston Churchill have we had a leader in this country whose decisions will be judged by generations to come.There is a fine line between respecting and assisting a crisis government, and failing to speak upit takes the wrong course. Sense-checking is an essential part of this process. The announcement last night by the parliament of New Zealand, that the legislative programme has been suspended and a special committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the leader of the opposition, with a majority of members from the opposition, is a fascinating attempt at bipartisan scrutiny of what is, in effect, a wartime government.The New Zealand model could, I think, work well in Scotland, where Jackson Carlaw is displaying his own outstanding leadership credentials by ensuring that the First Minister knows he has her back, and thathe does develop any concerns he will deal with them in the right way.Indeed, Mr Carlawrsquos letter on Tuesday to his Conservative colleague in the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, shows that he is just as prepared to raise an issue of concernwith a Tory as he is with a Nationalist.The truth is that the great majority of the people who make it their business to criticise Mr Johnson or Ms Sturgeon couldnrsquot lace their boots. They do so through spectacles tinted by their political bias. Furthermore, it is one-dimensional criticism which takes no account of the plethora of factors they have to consider.Behavioural science doesnrsquot work, critics say, we should have had a lockdown weeks ago, like in China. But a lockdown in a dictatorship, where non-compliance could lead to a long jail term, or worse, is dferent from a lockdown in a free society. Chinese lives may be saved now, but what has been the cost in human le of the Communist regime Madrid built a field hospital weeks ago, yet Matt Hancock only announced our first one on Tuesday. Wersquore miles behind, right  Wrong. Of course countries in Europe took some steps first the virus reached there signicantly earlier than here. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the UK, and Scotland, are ahead of our continental neighbours at this point in the curve.The irony of all of this is that those who seek to use the coronavirus to launch politicised criticism at our leaders are actually criticising the Governmentrsquos medical, scientic and behavioural experts. For it is their advice which has shaped Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeonrsquos strategy all along.As the modelling changes, so does the advice, and so does the strategy. That is precisely what should happen. This is not about politics. This is about government. Soyou have something useful to say, then speak.

And it came in a seemingly unimportant way. The experience was like hearing a distant rumble of thunder and realising a raging storm was approaching.On Monday nights, I get my weekly fix of American political satire when I tune into Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, and then Bill Maherrsquos Real Time show. These programmes are the beating heart of liberal America. Both play before live audiences ndash but not last week. The hosts told their jokes to empty, silent studios. Vibrant, energy-packed stand-up felt hollow, deadened, humourless. And then both shows announced they were going off air.Little spots of light in our culture keep going dark. British TV dramas stopped filming. Release dates for movies were delayed, even the latest James Bond, titled ndash with awful serendipity ndash No Time To Die. Bond may seem inconsequential ndash and, indeed, in the great scheme of things a spy film is utterly meaningless ndash but the mothballing of one of the biggest global entertainment franchises shows just how much Coronavirus has silenced culture.Some will rightly say: therersquos plenty of existing culture to keep us occupied ndash lots of books and films and music. Thatrsquos true, but itrsquos not the point. Thatrsquos not what culture is for. Culture isnrsquot there just to keep you distracted. Culture is also meant to reflect the world wersquore living in, to express the human spirit right here and right now. When culture stops, that canrsquot happen. And eventually, even Netflix will run out of stockpiled programmes. Culture ndash in the shape of books, films and songs ndash is finite.

Herersquos what we know: Alex Salmond was accused of sexual assault and attempted rape and the jury ed not guilty verdicts on  of the sexual assault charges, including one of attempted rape, and ruled not proven on a charge of sexual assault with intent to rape. Herersquos what we donrsquot know: the identities of the women who accused him.That cannot be fair. Historically, the process of investigation, prosecution, and defence has been guided by a balance between complainants and the accused. But in recent years the balance has come under strain and we know why: the Savile scandal led to a principle that ldquoall victims should be believed and protected. And ldquoprotected meant anonymity whatever happens.Accused people, as wersquove seen, do not have similar rights, and the consequences can be horrendous. Read Harvey Proctorrsquos memoir Credible and Trueyou want to know more. The former MP was one of the targets of Scotland Yardrsquos investigation into claims of a paedophile ring. The claims were untrue but Mr Proctorrsquos reputation was traduced and trashed. Wersquove seen the same with Mr Salmond.The answer is anonymity for accused people in all cases where the accuser has anonymity. Both parties should have the right to identy themselvesthey want to, but they should not have the right to identy the other party. In fact, we should go further: it should be a criminal offence for a complainant to reveal the identity of the accused. Cases like Mr Salmondrsquos add to the pressure for such a change to happen and, in the end, I think it will.A change along those lines would be good for all of us for a simple reason: it would restore the historical balance between the two parties and protect citizens no matter which side of a court case theyrsquore on. And itrsquos based on a simple principle of fairness and equality: it wasnrsquot fair that Mr Salmondrsquos name was made public while the names of his accusers werenrsquot and the unfairness was darkly underlined by the fact that the jury did not believe the accusers.The same changes should be made to the quasi-judicial processes in workplaces because the same problems occur. Any member of staff accused of impropriety should know the facts, the people involved, they should be given a proper chance to defend themselves, and the investigation should be impartial. The Scottish Government failed on all of those counts and I fear other workplaces would too for the same reason ndash ldquoall victims should be believed and protected.Irsquom not asking you to feel sorry for Alex Salmond here ndash all Irsquom saying is that making our procedures fairer would be good for all of us. Irsquom also hoping the end of the trial might signal a bit of re-tuning in politics too. There were some who hoped the court case would damage the SNP, and it may still do sothe fall-out lands on the First Minister. But the private travails of Mr Salmond are unlikely to change many minds on the issue of how we govern Scotland, and quite right too. My hope now is we can stick to the point.Much more interesting is what Mr Salmond, the politician, does next. We know the SNP is ided, but because of the trial the Salmond camp hasnrsquot been able to marshal itself yet. The verdict changes that and Irsquom intrigued, and a bit worried, about where that will take us, because I remember . Unionists sat back and said ldquosupport for independence is in the s, itrsquos fine. A few months later they sat up and said ldquosupport for independence is in the high s! What are we going to do , and it was largely Alex Salmond who did that.Despite everything thatrsquos happened, I think Mr Salmond still has that capacity to inject kineticism, risk and wrath into the debate. If he targets it at the SNP in the short term, itrsquoll be nasty, but in the longer termhe and his allies regain control of the independence cause, we shouldnrsquot underestimate the effect it could have.

Though the two may be confused in his mind.He said that as Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeonrsquos respective camps slugged it out, the SNP would look ided.ldquoAlready looking shaky on policy, and weak on independence, they will now be doubted on questions of character and judgement.ldquoIf it werenrsquot for the unknown virus factor, you could begin to imagine that they wonrsquot win the  Holyrood election.ldquoThat Labour under Keir Starmer might revive. That itrsquos all over now.ldquoSalmondrsquos fightback has begun.He added: ldquoIn his sights are the majority, governing party the SNP, the Scottish Government, who he may sue for the experience of being ly accused, and the structure of the state.ldquoThat mouth, so often the source of a barbed remark, or a cheeky grin, is set to start eating Scotland up. Hersquoll take bites out of everyoneit means he wins the argument.ldquoHe wonrsquot stop, because he canrsquot, his insecurity drives him to never stop.ldquoAnd much as Scotland once swallowed his lines, he now prepares to swallow Scotland.A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said:ldquoItrsquos a reasonable gauge of Alex Salmondrsquos character that even his own defence witnesses are laying into him.ldquoAnd it seems now the former First Minister is willing to tear the SNP apart simply because he likes the idea of winning.ldquoThis very public civil war within the party of government is the last thing Scotland needs at this moment.In a separate development, Mr Neil, who has called for a judge-led inquiry into whether Mr Salmond was the victim of a state conspiracy, said the former FM shouldto frontline politics.Mr Salmond lost his Gordon seat at Westminster in  and resigned from the SNP in August .Party rules say he must wait until August this year before he can reapply for membership, meaning he would miss the candidate selection process for the  Holyrood election.The rules also say that because he publicly announced his resignation, his application to rejoin would have to be approved by the SNPrsquos ruling National Executive Committee.This is dominated by Ms Sturgeon and her supporters.Mr Neil and another supporter of Mr Salmond, MP Joanna Cherry QC, have said Mr Salmond should be readmitted to the party he once led as soon as possible.Mr Neil, a former health secretary, told the Daily Record: ldquoI do not see why Alex should not be back in the party. He was acquitted of all charges. The SNP cannot ignore someone of his talents and achievements. I would be happy for Alex to be back at Holyrood.ldquoHe nearly led Scotland to independence. He would absolutely enhance the reputation of the Parliament.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.You said earlier in this thread: #We have much ignorance and  information in the media.# I suggest you focus on getting your facts right before you start bashingor the press at large. Unless of course you have abandoned the truth and decided to take the path of the most habitual of liars Donald Trump  In which case I#d have more success debating this issuewith a brick!Now stop panicking and do like me. I have volunteered to come out of retirement and rejoin the NHS. I am qualied to help and will do so without questionI can. Now just stop your moaning, spreading of alarmist criticism and postulating about something you know little. Nothing is much worse than raising fear and alarm when one is not remotely qualied so to do.Ian T # I#d advise you to crawl out of your own behind, but you appear so far up it any effort to to do so would likely be futile. I#ll leave it for others to read this discussion and decide who knows what between us.With the government shutting down Parliament, and effective scrutiny of its actions, yesterdaythere is no prospect of outside pressure changing their course at the moment. Everybody#s time, is therefore, best spent dealing with the practicalities of the situation we face for now.Your offer to come out of retirement to help the health service is commendable and I wish you all the best with that. It was inspirational to see over half a million people sign up yesterday to volunteer with the NHS.I remain sceptical about the path our government is on with this coronavirus but the likes of these NHS volunteers give me hope. I urge everybody to follow their lead and do whatever they can to look after themselves, those around them and other people in general during these challenging times.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  . Unlike Shetland they are almost certainly testing for Covid- more widely in the community, so it is not possible to directly compare our current figure of  hospital tested cases to their .Whoops, no. I gave the population of Faro!! Portugal!!! Dyslexia rules OK!!!!Just to state the obvious. If you are afraid for yourself,relatives and loved ones. All you have to do is stay inside your house. It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin.

We watched as petrol bombs were made on a makefht production line and stored behind the barricade at the top of Ramoan Gardens. Young as we were, we knew that this was an epoch-making time.My most vivid memory from those franticfew days in August is of Patcheye Doyle standing on the roof of a Morris  which was caving in under his weight. His one eye dancing, he was roaring at a gathering of local men, urging them to get organised before the next onslaught. A fearsome and fearless scrapper of some reknown, Patcheye took the lead while others dithered. He was a hard man, in a time when that epithet was more than a throwaway schoolyard taunt.And of course, there was real fear abroad. There were no weapons to hold off an invasion, no police force to turn to for protection.And yet, the people did pull together defences, after a fashion. Barricades went up, British Army ‘ex-servies’ patrolled the streets and the people turned to each other for support and comfort.Mistakes were made too in the maelstrom. Some concerned matters of le and death, others were less consequential but remain with me: I remember the proud pine trees on the Glen Road being cut down to block the road. You can still seethe gaps where they once stood – and where their more fortunate cousins continue to watch over us.And, yet,we survived. Not in one piece, admittedly. But we emerged on the other side. Changed for sure, stronger undoubtedly but also scarred.And so what I can retrieve from thoseall-but forgotten memories of the heady days of August ’ to help us as we march headlong into this coming Cornavirus hurricane  Well, put up the barricades. Protect your neighbour. Gear up for the fight.But most of all, listen to the key men and women – those selfless heroes who we will find today not on car roofs but in the hospital emergency rooms and the Intensive Care Units. They have given us fair warning: keep your distance, isolate and defend the elderly, wash your hands and, above all , stay at home.I can put it no better than in the words of a -year-old paper boy who arrived, complete with surgical gloves, to the Andersonstown News offices last week insisting that he be allowed to do his door-to-doorpaper round — which we had cancelled in light of the crisis. Pointinga gloved finger at me, he said, “I will knock the f*** out of this Coronavirus.” Patcheye must be smiling down.Today it’s not Shankill against Falls or unionist versus nationalist. It’s all of us, one people, one city, and one battle which we cannot and which we most certainlyWILL NOTlose."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus derry churches join forces to support people in isolated rural areas","story":"From left: Fr Noel McDermott , Elaine Way , Rev Lindsay Blair , Trevor Evans , Rev Canon Paul Hoeyand Debbie Caulfield  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFrom left: Fr Noel McDermott , Elaine Way , Rev Lindsay Blair , Trevor Evans , Rev Canon Paul Hoeyand Debbie Caulfield By Donna DeeneyMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailVolunteers from the three main churches in the rural parish of Faughanvale outside Londonderry have come together to provide support and pastoral care to residents isolated as part of coronavirus control measures.Catholic priest Fr Noel McDermott, Church of Ireland rector Rev Paul Hoey and Presbyterian minister Rev Lindsay Blair joined forces to make sure their elderly and vulnerable parishioners are looked after during this lockdown period.Leaflets have been delivered to more than , homes in the parish#s two villages of Eglinton and Greysteel and into the rural hinterlands with contact numbers for representatives of the three churches.Offers to collect medication from the local pharmacy and shop for vital supplies of food were soon taken up, according to project co-ordinator Debbie Caulfield, manager of Eglinton Community Hall.Speaking to the Belfast , Ms Caulfield explained: This was very much the idea of Fr McDermott, Rev Blair and Rev Hoey who came together to see how they could best serve the needs of the parish during this time when so many people have been told to stay at home.Faughanvale parish is very rural and there are a lot of people who are literally living in the middle of nowhere so it would be easy for them to feel alone and isolated.The three clergymen are offering pastoral care but each church has appointed a contact person that can organise practical help and it is being co-ordinated through the community hall in Eglinton.Once someone gets in touch we can appoint a volunteer to go and get food, lt prescriptions or whatever is needed.I will contact the person and let them know the name of the volunteer and let them know they will be with them within the hour and that their food or medicine will be left outside.Ms Caulfield said the scheme, which is still in its infancy, is already giving comfort to the elderly and vulnerable and their families.She added: We have had an incredible response to the scheme, not just from people who need our help but from their families too who can#t get out of their own homes.What has been great to see is people using the scheme but not one person has been abusing it.Rector of St Canice#s, Rev Paul Hoey, said he and his clerical counterparts in the Catholic and Presbyterian churches wanted to provide both spiritual and practical help to their parishioners.He said: We in Eglinton Churches Together have already been responding prayerfully to the public health emergency, but we felt that it was important to respond in a practical way, too. There will be many people in our community who will be hurting in the weeks and months ahead. Many will be self-isolating. Many will be anxious. Some will be experiencing financial distress. We want to be there for them - to help them and support them.A similar scheme is also operating in the Donaghmore and Castlecaulfield parishes in Co Tyrone, operated by parish priest Fr David Moore, Rev Peter Thompson from the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian minister Mark Dodds.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chaos, drama, excitement, panic and a few laughs all rolled into one.The whole disappointment of not being able to hold the wedding in April and the failed attempts to move the date forward made it look like it wasn#t supposed to happen for us right now.We wanted a church wedding. The vows before God were the most important thing for both of us. In the end, had it not been for the advice of our limo driver, Brian McCauley from First Choice Limousine and Wedding Hire, none of this would have happened.He had  bookings cancelled in a single day and called me on Tuesday morning to seewe#d got any new arrangements. He told us to call the local council and seethey could do anything and he#d be ready. That kick started everything into gear.The lady I was speaking to at the council to was very sympathetic and said her own daughter had also cancelled her wedding, but when I said we had all the papers we needed to get married in church next Saturday, only for that to have been cancelled, she told me she#d phone me back. I told her #no bother# and said a little prayer. Whatever happened would be meant to happen and I would accept that.She called back a few minutes later and said all we needed was the go-ahead from the council office. And we now had it. The only problem was we only had until midnight to do it!That#s when we had to spring into action. I had a dress that hadn#t actually been bought for the wedding but it looked right. There was a rush to get suits collected as the shops were closing and didn#t know when they#d be open again. One shop had to re-open quickly to get my shoes sorted. It was a mad day and by .pm I was on my way to St Columba#s Church, Long Tower in Derry in the back of Brian#s wedding car!As Rosemarie rushed around in Dungiven, emergency medical technician Sean had issues of his own to deal with.I was on a  call when Rosemarie tried to phone me.

Just a few of us, one by one, then we stood apart as the social distancing advice tells us. But we did move closer together to exchange rings, and Sean did kiss the bride.It was important to us as a couple to have a church wedding. As practising Catholics it#s what we wanted, and we have to thank everyone who helped on Tuesday in such a mad rush.The couple#s #reception# was back on her parents# farm near Dungiven, where they were treated to a fry-up.We couldn#t have wished for anything better as a first meal as a married couple, said Rosemarie.I#m from a big family, said Sean.

The UK Government says I must only travel to and from work“absolutely necessary” - how do I knowit is “absolutely necessary” A. All those who are able to work from home have been advised to do so, however for many jobs this is not possible. Those providing essential services or goods will still be able to travel to and from work. Social distancing rules, however, should still be enforced. This means you should stay at least two metres apart from anyone and work gatherings should not take place.Q. Will the children of orced parents be able to visit both of them A. Cabinet minister the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has confirmed that children under  can move between the households of separated parents, as long as this is normal practice.Q.

All social gatherings of more than two people are prohibited.Q. What businesses are allowed to remain open A. Only businesses providing essential goods or services are permitted to stay open. In the food and drink industry, this includes restaurants operating takeaway or delivery services and canteens at hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons.Facilities offering food or drink to the homeless are also permitted.All retail shops should shut, except for supermarkets and other food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, hardware shops and laundrettes.Pet shops, newsagents and banks can also remain open.Here#s the full list of essential retail services which should continue to trade in Northern Ireland:Supermarkets , convenience stores and corner shopsGrocery markets – not including farmers markets, hot food markets or street food marketsLocal fresh food suppliers like butchers, fishmongers and bakeriesHot food takeaways - over the counter services only and not allowing an option to eat inPharmacies Chemists and Health food shopsDental surgeries, opticians, audiology, physiotherapy, chiropody and other professional vocational medical services – for urgent appointments onlyVeterinary clinics and pet shopsNewsagentsHardware and building supplies storesRetail services in hospitalsPetrol stations, garages, and auto repair shops for urgent work onlyHigh street banks, credit unions and cash pointsPost officesFuneral directors, crematoriums and relatedLaundrettes and dry cleanersStorage and distribution facilities, including delivery drop-off pointsMedical or storage servicesPublic car parks in towns and cities near food takeaway servicesPublic toilets.Businesses that are permitted to stay open have been asked to ensure a distance of two meters is kept between customers and shop assistants, to only let people enter in small groups, and to introduce queue control measures outside the premises.Hotels, hostels and BBs can only remain open for those guests staying while their primary residence is unavailable. Key workers can also continue to stay at such accommodation.Manufacturing and construction firms can continue to operate as long as they enforce social distancing.

How will these measures be enforced A. Police will have the power to disperse public gatherings and issue fines, however it is unclear how officers will monitor whether people are breaking the rules, what action will then be taken, and how much the fines will be.Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will enforce the rules regarding businesses. Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.Q. How long will the restrictions be in place for A. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks. It is right we review what are quite draconian measures. But I would imagine it will last longer than three weeks,” she said.Belfast Related ContentVideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: It#s for the best, says Foster as she welcomes Prime Minister#s move to place UK on lockdownArlene Foster has welcomed Boris Johnson#s announcement of draconian new restrictions on everyday le in a bid to tackle the spread of coronavirus.Lindy McDowellOpinionLindy McDowell:Enormity of coronavirus crisis we face is laid bare on day of raw emotion in the AssemblyThese are the choices we are going to have to deal with...

They will need some sort of timetable and structure throughout the day.It’s also important that they have time for rest and family le, time to maybe go outside and it’s very important that they#re not overloaded with work.As a teacher, I’m going to make sure that my classes have got work in little chunks and that the teaching will continue in the amount of time that they would usually have at school.Be flexibleYou have to be flexible with the amount of time that children spend doing school work. Some households will maybe have three or four children using one computer, so it’s important that it’s broken up into easy chunks. There are so many dferent things that can children can do. They can read a book, they can do things about the house, get some exercise outside, but it is important that they keep focused and do the lessons that teachers are setting online.Use time off school wiselyWe can use this time as an opportunity. It’s important for family time. It’s maybe important that children know how to cook, or that they do a bit of exercise. There’s so many things parents can do - it’s not just about the school work.#Use all available resourcesBBC Bitesize is brilliant for Key Stage  and Key Stage . There’s also so many things available through the library service librariesni.org.uk where you can download so many books.Many schools already have resources online through the Fronter service, through My-School, through Google Drive and through homework apps. This is a time of opportunity. There are many companies putting things online for children to access for free which you can find on Google.Don#t put too much pressure on yourselfI think we have to be realistic. The school year is usually about  weeks long, so the next few weeks will be very challenging but that’s a very small amount of the entire year, so it’s just important that we can keep the children focused on as much work as they can.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was included as a commitment under the Fresh Start Agreement in , with a budget allocation of £m over the four years to -.Mr Lunn said costs will inevitably risethe project is allowed to go ahead. He continued: Due to legal challenges and public enquiries, since , no substantial construction work has been possible, but £.m has been expended, of which approximately £m has gone to consultants, the remainder to land acquisition, ground investigation, legal fees etc.Bearing in mind that every court decision since  has been, in full or in part, favourable to the objectors, more challenges and delay seems inevitable and also inevitable is the cost increases caused by delay.The current estimate,work was able to begin is around £bn for the three sections with an contribution from the Republic of Ireland, which would have to be renegotiated, of £m. There has been a -year delay in commencement with more delay and cost inflation almost certain. The estimated cost overrun is now about £m.SDLP West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan said halting the A project would not solve the financial impact of tackling coronavirus. He said: Of course all necessary resources should be directed towards health and in bolstering our health service.All focus now needs to be directed towards tackling this pandemic but cutting a major infrastructure project such as the A is not the answer. The money that will be spent on the A is a drop in the ocean given the overall Stormont spend.If cutting capital projects was the direction of travel, you could look at the Belfast Transport Hub, the North South Belfast Glider or the Yorkgate interchange projects. They are all costing millions equally.Mr McCrossan said the A, when completed, would prove invaluable to boosting Northern Ireland#s future economy.He added: My support for the A remains unfettered. It is an essential project and will be even more important economically for the North West during the recovery process of this pandemic. We also have no rail services here and we#ve suffered generations of infrastructure neglect.This is a time for politicians to work together, this is not and should not be about anything other than saving lives.

Following British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s shutdown announcement on Monday, the public’s movements have been restricted which has dramatically changed the outlook in the Creggan area and beyond. People have lost jobs, been forced to self-isolate and cut themselves off from wider society. A home delivery service run from Rath Mor Centre has become very popular. Coupled with the distribution of food parcels, it has proven to be a leline for people experiencing financial hardship. The Rath Mor Centre, run by Creggan Enterprises, is a multi-purpose community facility comprising of retail services, a business centre and community services googletag.cmd.push Popular businesses including the hair salon, cafeacute and florists have been forced to close their doors resulting in the temporary, and potentially permanent, loss of - jobs. The loss of jobs will have a ‘major impact’ on the Creggan, Brandywell and Bogside area, Rath Mor Chief Executive Conal McFeely said. What remains at the centre is the supermarket, taxi company, pharmacy, post office and newly opened health centre to provide key services for the community.

A network of new Primary Care COVID- Centres is being rapidly established to manage the growth of coronavirus cases in the community. As of :am on Wednesday March , testing has resulted in  new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to . To date, seven people who tested positive have sadly died. A newly published surveillance report by the Public Health Agency provides a breakdown of confirmed cases by district area. It revealed that Derry and Strabane has between  and  confirmed cases of COVID- at present while Belfast has the highest with - cases. googletag.cmd.push The latest information for the south of Ireland, as of yesterday evening, showed that there have now been seven COVID- related deaths and , confirmed cases. Speaking to the Derry News after completing his first sht at Altnagelvin’s COVID- Centre, local doctor Paul Molloy wished to stress that it is not a virus testing centre. He said the rise in cases is less than expected - but still bad - which reflects the exceptional social isolation skills being shown. The local GP praised the Derry public for their efforts and urged them to ‘keep it up’. Dr Molloy advised: “Please do not ring looking for a test or asking your GP. The only people that will be tested are people being admitted to hospital and they will be low numbers hopefully. googletag.cmd.push “There will be a large increase in tests available soon. The priority will be very sick patients, those admitted with possible virus, healthcare workers so we can maintain a workforce and then nursing home patients. “If you are in the community with flu but overall are well just use the isolation measures and keep yourself hydrated and symptom free.” He added: “I repeat there will not be testing for people in the community routinely. “The set-up is very, very safe for patients and staff. We were all shown how to put on and off the protective equipment. “Once your GP decides you need to go to the centre - the out of hours in Altnagelvin - the GP contacts them and an appointment time is given. Then you put on a mask when you arrive, a nurse takes your temperature, pulse etc and a doctor sees you. “You will probably get a treatment and go home. Very sick people will be assessed by the medical team. You may still be sent home or kept on ward  or . “The vast majoritypeople phoning your GP will just be given a treatment by the GP and not sent to the COVID centre. “Some people might go by ambulance to the Emergency Department. Children who are lower risk from this virus will be assessed in paediatrics.” RAPID ACTION Visiting Derry’s COVID- centre, Health Minister Robin Swann explained that more centres will open in the coming days, with at least one COVID- centre in each Trust area. Minister Swann said: “Primary Care COVID- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non COVID- related conditions. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider. “Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the COVID- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.” Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital. Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care COVID- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres. “This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.” Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing. “We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus. The message is clear - stay home, protect yourself and protect others so that the Health Service can protect us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A network of new Primary Care COVID- Centres is being rapidly established to manage the growth of coronavirus cases in the community. As of :am on Wednesday March , testing has resulted in  new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to . To date, seven people who tested positive have sadly died. A newly published surveillance report by the Public Health Agency provides a breakdown of confirmed cases by district area. It revealed that Derry and Strabane has between  and  confirmed cases of COVID- at present while Belfast has the highest with - cases. googletag.cmd.push The latest information for the south of Ireland, as of yesterday evening, showed that there have now been seven COVID- related deaths and , confirmed cases. Speaking to the Derry News after completing his first sht at Altnagelvin’s COVID- Centre, local doctor Paul Molloy wished to stress that it is not a virus testing centre. He said the rise in cases is less than expected - but still bad - which reflects the exceptional social isolation skills being shown. The local GP praised the Derry public for their efforts and urged them to ‘keep it up’. Dr Molloy advised: “Please do not ring looking for a test or asking your GP. The only people that will be tested are people being admitted to hospital and they will be low numbers hopefully. googletag.cmd.push “There will be a large increase in tests available soon. The priority will be very sick patients, those admitted with possible virus, healthcare workers so we can maintain a workforce and then nursing home patients. “If you are in the community with flu but overall are well just use the isolation measures and keep yourself hydrated and symptom free.” He added: “I repeat there will not be testing for people in the community routinely. “The set-up is very, very safe for patients and staff. We were all shown how to put on and off the protective equipment. “Once your GP decides you need to go to the centre - the out of hours in Altnagelvin - the GP contacts them and an appointment time is given. Then you put on a mask when you arrive, a nurse takes your temperature, pulse etc and a doctor sees you. “You will probably get a treatment and go home. Very sick people will be assessed by the medical team. You may still be sent home or kept on ward  or . “The vast majoritypeople phoning your GP will just be given a treatment by the GP and not sent to the COVID centre. “Some people might go by ambulance to the Emergency Department. Children who are lower risk from this virus will be assessed in paediatrics.” RAPID ACTION Visiting Derry’s COVID- centre, Health Minister Robin Swann explained that more centres will open in the coming days, with at least one COVID- centre in each Trust area. Minister Swann said: “Primary Care COVID- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non COVID- related conditions. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider. “Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the COVID- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.” Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital. Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care COVID- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres. “This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.” Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing. “We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus. The message is clear - stay home, protect yourself and protect others so that the Health Service can protect us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s very, very strange.” Around - people would be watching Mass online but he believes church is all about community and once the current crisis passes he would like to see people coming together to celebrate Mass again. “There’s no substitute for actually coming out and meeting each other face to face and that has to be encouraged when this is all over.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was the same story when we went to Japan.“We didn’t know what people were gonna think. We played to whole crowds who never heard us before. It’s reminiscent of the same feeling we had when we first played this set in Derry.“We didn’t knowpeople would like it. We didn’t even knowit made sense. Japan was our first tour.“Ciaraacuten and Miacutecheacuteal are from Japan, so it was always our dream to play there. One year an opportunity arose, and we just grabbed it. After that we played some shows around Ireland, and now Central Europe. They seemed to really like us there, especially the anarchists.” googletag.cmd.push If they excite the anarchists, who excites them “We really don’t have many influences. I think a way to look at is we were influenced by each other. In Foreign Owl, we’re more inspired by how the other plays their music, rather than another outside the band.“So of course, our own inidual music taste might affect how we play, but that’s filtered before it’s gets into the rehearsal.“If me and Ciaraacuten are vibing over Radiohead, it’s not going to get farMiacutecheacuteal isn’t in the same feeling. It only really works when we are totally in the room with each other, not somewhere .“So, we’ve kinda developed to leave any outside influence by the door.“When we started, we all really enjoyed The Red Hot Chili Peppers as well as a band called Radwimps from Japan,any bands added some influence on the band’s roots, I’d say it be them.” googletag.cmd.push What about locally “There’s really so many to mention. I don’t know how much people from Derry notice, but the music scene here is one of the best I’ve ever known.“There’s so much realism to it. If you go to other cities or country and watch some bands, there’s a lot more ‘trying to be something’ but in Derry, almost every act is totally authentic. It’s as vibrant as the Dublin scene but with more energy.“Dirty Faces are awesome, and the nicest guys. You need people like that to have a healthy scene.“Happy Out is class, they totally inspire us.Gas Hands are great, and the singer Dylan Brady and bassist Nolan Donnelly have done amazing things for the le of the music scene.“Cherym have really taken off and they deserve that. Fantastic band.“Red Organ Serpent Sound are phenomenal. There really are so many great bands and artists in Derry that it’s hard to give everyone the credit they deserve. When you start to think about all the great artists and shows over the years, it’s mind boggling.” Tell me about other stuff you do“We are kinda musical focused. We met through Taiko drumming, Miacutecheacuteal studies music in NWRC, Ciaran’s a drummer through and through, great sound engineers too.We have a lot of passion for friendship but in terms of our hobbies and activities, it’s all music and art.“If we can improv it, we jam it.It’s cool that you asked that because I didn’t even notice that everything, we’ve all done, has pretty much always related to music.” And what have you got planned “Last year we recorded our debut album to -track tape. It’s been a long time coming and we’re excited to share it.“For us, we wanted to wait until we were good enough at the whole music thing before attempting an album.Originally, the plan was to release the album this year, as well as multiple tours in Ireland and Europe as well as festivals, but unfortunately, with the recent pandemic, the music industry has taken a big hit. It’s dficult to plan when everything is uncertain.“Most of our shows we had planned our cancelled and it’s hard to figure out where to go from there. If there’s a way we can bring any of our plans into fruition this year, we will. If not, it’ll be next year. We’ll have our first single from the album coming out on the th of March.

It was the same story when we went to Japan.“We didn’t know what people were gonna think. We played to whole crowds who never heard us before. It’s reminiscent of the same feeling we had when we first played this set in Derry.“We didn’t knowpeople would like it. We didn’t even knowit made sense. Japan was our first tour.“Ciaraacuten and Miacutecheacuteal are from Japan, so it was always our dream to play there. One year an opportunity arose, and we just grabbed it. After that we played some shows around Ireland, and now Central Europe. They seemed to really like us there, especially the anarchists.” googletag.cmd.push If they excite the anarchists, who excites them “We really don’t have many influences. I think a way to look at is we were influenced by each other. In Foreign Owl, we’re more inspired by how the other plays their music, rather than another outside the band.“So of course, our own inidual music taste might affect how we play, but that’s filtered before it’s gets into the rehearsal.“If me and Ciaraacuten are vibing over Radiohead, it’s not going to get farMiacutecheacuteal isn’t in the same feeling. It only really works when we are totally in the room with each other, not somewhere .“So, we’ve kinda developed to leave any outside influence by the door.“When we started, we all really enjoyed The Red Hot Chili Peppers as well as a band called Radwimps from Japan,any bands added some influence on the band’s roots, I’d say it be them.” googletag.cmd.push What about locally “There’s really so many to mention. I don’t know how much people from Derry notice, but the music scene here is one of the best I’ve ever known.“There’s so much realism to it. If you go to other cities or country and watch some bands, there’s a lot more ‘trying to be something’ but in Derry, almost every act is totally authentic. It’s as vibrant as the Dublin scene but with more energy.“Dirty Faces are awesome, and the nicest guys. You need people like that to have a healthy scene.“Happy Out is class, they totally inspire us.Gas Hands are great, and the singer Dylan Brady and bassist Nolan Donnelly have done amazing things for the le of the music scene.“Cherym have really taken off and they deserve that. Fantastic band.“Red Organ Serpent Sound are phenomenal. There really are so many great bands and artists in Derry that it’s hard to give everyone the credit they deserve. When you start to think about all the great artists and shows over the years, it’s mind boggling.” Tell me about other stuff you do“We are kinda musical focused. We met through Taiko drumming, Miacutecheacuteal studies music in NWRC, Ciaran’s a drummer through and through, great sound engineers too.We have a lot of passion for friendship but in terms of our hobbies and activities, it’s all music and art.“If we can improv it, we jam it.It’s cool that you asked that because I didn’t even notice that everything, we’ve all done, has pretty much always related to music.” And what have you got planned “Last year we recorded our debut album to -track tape. It’s been a long time coming and we’re excited to share it.“For us, we wanted to wait until we were good enough at the whole music thing before attempting an album.Originally, the plan was to release the album this year, as well as multiple tours in Ireland and Europe as well as festivals, but unfortunately, with the recent pandemic, the music industry has taken a big hit. It’s dficult to plan when everything is uncertain.“Most of our shows we had planned our cancelled and it’s hard to figure out where to go from there. If there’s a way we can bring any of our plans into fruition this year, we will. If not, it’ll be next year. We’ll have our first single from the album coming out on the th of March.

The canary was sent down the mineshaft and didn’t . googletag.cmd.push It was a shockingly sudden and complete disappearance.  PICTURED:Daniel and King Henry  We’re all now sat six feet apart at the sporting wakenot quite at the funeral yet. Sport, all sports, build strong social bonds. Friendships, networks. Shared interests, hopes, dreams, disappointments. Togetherness. None of us are getting out of here alive. And the ability to enjoy the triviality of sport is often a welcome distraction from le’s deathly inevitability. The Doherty males are very much traditional men. We still ask for a bar of Marathon, never Snickers. Muhammad Ali will always be Cassius Clay. And, to a man, we still refer to the Waterfoot Hotel as the Blue Tit. And other than running around the house wearing Seagate outfits these days, the skin near washed off our hands, we’re taking things very much in our stride. But we’re simple folk, and we love sport. The first confirmed sighting of cabin fever in Derry arrived at Doherty Towers approximately  seconds after the self-imposed lockdown. Like most parents across the country and beyond we’ve faced the same quandary all week, and will continue to do so in the weeks to come. Our days seem to fall into broadly the same routine. Wake up, remove their Ipads and attempt to stop the kids killing each other. Watch some news and get the beJesus scared out of me. Stop the kids trying to kill each other. Watch some more news and get the beJesus scared out of me. Stop the kids trying to kill each other. Give them their Ipads back. Watch some more news and empty the last of my entrails into my now soggy togs. Put kids to bed.Breathe. Open the bottle of wine. Rinse and repeat. Those ing clowns from Cheltenham to these shores will have certainly cost lives. Shame on them. Panic buying at the supermarket can be put down to fear. But it’s greedy and wrong, and should still be called out. There’s plenty for everyonewe all keep cool.  PICTURED:Monkey Magic  It’s a team game, and we’re all playing for the same team now. Not one amongst is without an elderly relative. Dozens probably. Or family members not quite as physically strong as us. This thing only workswe all put the shoulder to the wheel. Facing the sporting abyss, therefore, offers up other options. It’s the perfect opportunity to rewatch some classic television – The Wire, The West Wing, Monkey Magic or Benny Hill. Or better still to relive the summer of love in  on Youtube, when Derry lted the Sam Maguire. Some outstanding sports documentaries can be found on Netflix. Start with The Dawn Wall. Why not read that classic book you always meant to  Or retrieve the dusty old box of Razzles from the attic. Or buy a newspaper. It’s no coincidence that the great Paddy Heaney has ed like Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider to enliven your Wednesdays in the Irish News. Buy a copy. And buy the Derry News, for God’s sake. Or use your solitary exercise allowance to dander down the Bay Road with a big blue bag of cans, keeping a socially isolated distance from your drinking buddy. In many ways we are the lucky ones. Cast adrt on the far westerly reaches of Europe, and an island nation too, we’re the last to feel the virus’ full force. We are blessed with some of the most magnicent beaches in the world, many of them just a short drive away. A walk, a jog, a cycle down the quay. Anything to take your mind off coronavirus to dampen the worry. Bono has written a song about the pandemic, aswe haven’t suffered enough. Hopefully our scientists and political masters can learn from our fallen fellow Europeans. Find a vaccine or treatment. Soften the blow. Save lives. Hope trumps fear every time. You almost pine for the days of the great ‘foot and mouth’ epidemic, where getting out of you motor at the border to tramp though a big wet sponge seemed such an inconvenience.   PICTURED:The dastardly coronavirus  My parents, who seem to have le sussed after years of hard work and halyin-rearing, jetted off to the Canary Islands recently. “No concerns about the coronavirus ” says I. “Not at all,” replied my mother. “Sure I’m taking the Rescue Remedy with me.” Her faith in that small bottle of homeopathic goodness both reassuring and worrying at the same time. While my father studiously checks the obituary section of the paper just to make sure he’s not in it. It’s not just a matter of le and death, it’s more important than that to paraphrase Bill Shankly. Of all the things that matter in this le, sport might not be too high up everybody’s list. But to many of us that begin reading our newspapers from the back, sport matters most. What’s it like to live in a world with no sport  Well we’re finding out the hard way and it’s as bleak as we could have imagined. But we have to remain positive, strong and sensible. And kind. And stay home. Optimists live longer, happier lives. Wine helps.  The words of Paddy’s uncle Seamus seem particularly apposite in these increasingly uncertain times… “If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Watch some more news and empty the last of my entrails into my now soggy togs. Put kids to bed.Breathe. Open the bottle of wine. Rinse and repeat. Those ing clowns from Cheltenham to these shores will have certainly cost lives. Shame on them. Panic buying at the supermarket can be put down to fear. But it’s greedy and wrong, and should still be called out. There’s plenty for everyonewe all keep cool.  PICTURED:Monkey Magic  It’s a team game, and we’re all playing for the same team now. Not one amongst is without an elderly relative. Dozens probably. Or family members not quite as physically strong as us. This thing only workswe all put the shoulder to the wheel. Facing the sporting abyss, therefore, offers up other options. It’s the perfect opportunity to rewatch some classic television – The Wire, The West Wing, Monkey Magic or Benny Hill. Or better still to relive the summer of love in  on Youtube, when Derry lted the Sam Maguire. Some outstanding sports documentaries can be found on Netflix. Start with The Dawn Wall. Why not read that classic book you always meant to  Or retrieve the dusty old box of Razzles from the attic. Or buy a newspaper. It’s no coincidence that the great Paddy Heaney has ed like Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider to enliven your Wednesdays in the Irish News. Buy a copy. And buy the Derry News, for God’s sake. Or use your solitary exercise allowance to dander down the Bay Road with a big blue bag of cans, keeping a socially isolated distance from your drinking buddy. In many ways we are the lucky ones. Cast adrt on the far westerly reaches of Europe, and an island nation too, we’re the last to feel the virus’ full force. We are blessed with some of the most magnicent beaches in the world, many of them just a short drive away. A walk, a jog, a cycle down the quay. Anything to take your mind off coronavirus to dampen the worry. Bono has written a song about the pandemic, aswe haven’t suffered enough. Hopefully our scientists and political masters can learn from our fallen fellow Europeans. Find a vaccine or treatment. Soften the blow. Save lives. Hope trumps fear every time. You almost pine for the days of the great ‘foot and mouth’ epidemic, where getting out of you motor at the border to tramp though a big wet sponge seemed such an inconvenience.   PICTURED:The dastardly coronavirus  My parents, who seem to have le sussed after years of hard work and halyin-rearing, jetted off to the Canary Islands recently. “No concerns about the coronavirus ” says I. “Not at all,” replied my mother. “Sure I’m taking the Rescue Remedy with me.” Her faith in that small bottle of homeopathic goodness both reassuring and worrying at the same time. While my father studiously checks the obituary section of the paper just to make sure he’s not in it. It’s not just a matter of le and death, it’s more important than that to paraphrase Bill Shankly. Of all the things that matter in this le, sport might not be too high up everybody’s list. But to many of us that begin reading our newspapers from the back, sport matters most. What’s it like to live in a world with no sport  Well we’re finding out the hard way and it’s as bleak as we could have imagined. But we have to remain positive, strong and sensible. And kind. And stay home. Optimists live longer, happier lives. Wine helps.  The words of Paddy’s uncle Seamus seem particularly apposite in these increasingly uncertain times… “If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They entered the MacLarnon Cup in  and won it at the first time of asking. Michael McMullan caught up with Ballinascreen man Kenny Bradley to take a look back... Kenny Bradley still vividly remembers the words of Master Brian McKevitt, asit was yesterday. The Louth man taught in St Patricks Maghera in the early years, before later moving on to the Abbey in Newry. Bradley and his mates were constantly told by McKevitt that St Patricks Maghera should be making its mark on the Ulster school scene. He would tell them the Derry club scene was among the best in Ireland. googletag.cmd.push With hindsight, McKevitt was proven right. Derry clubs have cleaned up all over Ulster and St Patricks Maghera would amass  MacRory Cup titles since their first in . They sit just four titles behind St Colmans, who lead the roll of honour. The adventure had to start somewhere. Someone had to break new ground. With Sean Spud Murphy in charge, St Patricks Maghera entered the MacLarnon Cup in  and won it at the first time of asking. It may be the forgotten team in that long illustrious list of successful teams on the corridor walls of St Patricks but, this group was indeed special. googletag.cmd.push To mark the Golden Jubilee, the  were due to come together earlier this month, for the first time in  years to mull over their memories. The recent coronavirus outbreak, put their plans on ice, but such was the enthusiasm for the initial idea, it has been put on the back burner until later in the year. On answering the phone in his Sixtowns home last week, Kenny Bradley was in his element, sting through ious clippings and artefacts. History, not necessarily sport, is in his DNA and all the memories from the year Maghera took their infant steps into Ulster Schools football have given him another spark. The school opened in  and this was now the first A-Level class to reach Upper Sixth. “We wouldnt have been allowed into the MacRory because you would have to have qualied through the MacLarnon,” Bradley outlines. Before that, the late Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt were involved with the youth teams. Ironically, when Maghera reached the semi-final of the MacRory in their first year, , it was Abbey – with McKevitt at the helm – who ran out narrow winners. Before that, came the gradual building blocks towards the class of  setting an example for others to follow. There were  boys in the first register in September of  and it built up over the next five years. It saw the school begin to field against local teams: St Colms Draperstown, St Pius Magherafelt and St Patricks Dungiven. “Once we went above that, we moved into the Ulster Colleges competitions,” Bradley added. A Corn na nOacuteg quarter-final place the previous year brought hope, wrote Lower Sixth pupil Barney Kielt in the school magazine that year. County minors Frankie McCotter, Mickey Moran, Eugene Laverty, Vincent Conway and Brendan Kelly were back on board. In from St Malachys Belfast came Cargin duo Packie McGuckin and Pat ONeill, who was on their winning Rannafast team. In the MacLarnon Cup, Dungannon Academy, St Patricks Omagh and St Marys Irvinestown all withdrew from Magheras group, left them with just Omagh CBS to play-off with to decide semi-finals pairings. Scores were hard to come by on a frosty December morning on Omaghs home pitch, as Maghera were - to - winners. Central to the win, as Kielt outlined, was midfield control from Conway and Laverty, helping set up scores for Liam Harbinson and Brendan Kelly. “Omagh had a great team back then,” Kenny Bradley recalls. “Their goalkeeper, Ciaran Harte, would have played for Tyrone, in goals as their reserve keeper. “The full-back was Willie McKenna, a brother of Eugene and Dessie McKenna. He went on to work over around Drumsurn, in the forestry. He played minor and U for Tyrone.” With challenge games against local Glen and Slaughtneil teams, St Patricks prepared for their semi-final with St Patricks Armagh, which Bradley describes as a tight enough game. In dficult conditions in Coalisland, it was a - brace after half-time that saw them book a place in the final against Omagh, who had defeated Dundalk on the other side of the draw. Given it being their first final and Omagh having played in the  MacRory semi-final, Kenny Bradley didnt really feel Maghera were going in as underdogs. “We knew we had a good team. We had played MacRory teams early on . We played Malachysin a friendly match down in Newbridge. We were short a couple of good players that day and they beat us by a point. It was a good tight game. We knew then, that we were as good as anybody. They also gave St Columbs Derry a good tight run at the start of the year. “We had boys like Eugene Laverty and Mickey Moran. Eugene Laverty wouldve ran through a hedge, that was the type of him – a big strong player and very dominant.” The sides were level at half-time in the final and when Pat ONeill edged Maghera into a - to - lead early in the second half, they never looked back. There was no All-Ireland series for the MacLarnon champions at that time. “I have no doubt that we wouldve won it, we were good enough and we had the stuff,” Bradley said, with confidence. Bradley, Vincent Conway and Brendan Kelly left the post-match celebrations and swtly headed for the Coalisland dressing rooms. At that time, in the Derry league, Ballinascreen fielded three teams – one in each ision – and on the day of the final, “We headed into Neillysfathers car and headed to Ballinascreen to play against Castledawson in the league. “We missed the celebrations and I remember thinking afterwards, were we feckin mad in the head. Youd think there would never be another game, but that was how mad we were to play football.” The team stopped in what it now called the Central Bar in Cookstown for a meal on the way home but Principal Fr Donnelly was far from happy with the Screen exodus. “He took Neilly out of class the next day. He gave him six slaps and a  lines for not showing up at the meal. I dont knowhe was telling the truth or not,” Bradley jokes. “We didnt worry too much about the celebrations back them. As Willie McKennalater mentioned to me....you played a match and when it was finished,there was another one, you went and played that, you never questioned who won or lost.” Behind the success was Sean Murphy, who had been in the school five years, who volunteered to take the team. “There was nobody busting themselves to get taking teams,” Bradley highlights. “He was the kind of man that called a spade a spade and we liked that about him. He hit the right note, there was no fuss with him, he just got on with it. “There were no sophisticated tactics, he picked the team the way he wanted and the boys did the rest.” Another change Bradley notices now, how more accessible school sport is and how much easier it is to stay behind for training. “There were no taxis in our day. I live up at the top of the Sixtowns, beside the Shepherds Rest, and you had to thumb it home. “It was hard to stay for the training and thats why we couldve been a lot betterwe had the modern-day facilities with boys being dropped off . Everybody wouldve been training all the time.” Bradley points to St Columbs being the team at that time but were on the wane. “The South Derry boys were starting to come to Maghera, and so too the Dungiven ones. Theywere still the big fellas but it wasnt long before Maghera overtook them.” But it was the class of  that was the real change in momentum. When the coronavirus crisis subsides and le s to relative normality, Kenny Bradley will get the wheels in motion to unite the team, who are all in good health. “They all went on to have good careers and good jobs in le. Youd have to say, they all fared fierce well for themselves. Its tara how quick the times goes past...its a flash. Brian McKevitt knew his football. Every journey begins with a single step and the team of  were the pioneers of Magheras summit to the top of Ulster schools football.

Rosemary McAllen Bucella lives just outside Varese, in the Italian region of Lombardy, and has been self-isolating as, at  years old, she falls into an at-risk category. She told DerryNow: “People have to stay at home, it’s the only solution. We have to stay at home to isolate this virus, there’s nothing  for it. “I look at Milan and it’s getting worse. People are not staying at home - they say % of people in Milan are still moving around. googletag.cmd.push “It’s totally irresponsible, they don’t realise how this can affect their own family. “Especially young people who will be carriers go back home to their family and friends and can be carrying the virus. “It can’t just be recommended, it has to be done for your own safety. Once we realised how dangerous it was, the government started to act and made rules. “People that go out risk being arrested. If we go from our townland to pick up shopping in a supermarket, we have to download a certicate from the internet and fill it in. “If we’re stopped by the police, we can show them that and they’ll check it.” googletag.cmd.push Rosemary lives in quite a remote area, but she is keen to warn people at home that this is no guarantee of protection from the spread of coronavirus. She said: “In Italy, people are dying like flies. “I would say we’re quite lucky because we don’t come into close contact with people, but there have still been a couple of deaths. “The terrible thing about this is that when they’re ill, they need to go to intensive care and that’s it. They don’t see another person in their family. If they die, they die alone. “They’re put in a coffin, there’s no one near them, there’s no funeral. They’re taken to be cremated and perhaps eventually, the relatives will get the ashes. “They get a phone call to say the person has passed on and that’s it, they can’t even have a funeral.” The Castledawson native has pleaded with people back home to take the warnings seriously and stay away from crowds. She said: “I’ve been telling them please, please stay away from people, don’t go into crowds. It’s vitally important that they stay at home in their own houses. “In a little place like Northern Ireland, they have to act quickly. It’s vital. Since family le in Ireland is important, people visit each other all the time. “They have to stop that. You can telephone, you can Skype. If you can look after yourself, they can stay out. They will have plenty of time to see them once this is all over,” added Rosemary.

The meeting was organised to discuss road maintenance in rural communities.The South Derry representatives raised the urgency for works on a number of roads that have suffered year after year of inclement weather and lack of surface treatment.CampaignMs Sheerin said she had been contacted by constituents who are concerned about the poor surfacing and maintenance on our rural network of roads. “I will continue to campaign for a number of roads that require urgent resurfacing that include the Sixtowns Road, Moneyneany Road, and the Desertmartin to Draperstown Road.“Improving rural roads and identying those areas that are in greatest need is a priority for rural safety. “I have requested that a scheme of works is designed and ready for resurfacing through Moneyneany village, from the Moydamlaght Road to the Drumderg Road. “Unfortunately, as with other schemes, this is dependent on departmental finance that has not been made available. “The minister has responsibility to ensure rural safety on our roads and that they are maintained to the relevant standard. I will continue to pressure the DfI Minister Nicola Mallon to release funding for this much needed work as a matter of urgency.”Engineers from the department were present and the local representatives pressed officials on a prepared scheme from Draperstown to Desertmartin for resurfacing along the stretch of road on the Draperstown side which did not benefit the last time work was carried out on this road.Cllr McGuigan said he had also used the meeting to highlight safety concerns on the A Glenshane Road ..“In the interest of road safety I have liaised with the department continuously on the need to address a suitable outcome for traffic travelling northbound on the Glenshane Pass turning right at the junction of Ranaghan Road. “The Glenshane Pass is a major road connection linking Belfast to Derry Donegal with high volume of commuters using both lanes, those turning right at the Ranaghan junction must come to a halt in the climbing lane.“The safety of motorists must come first and a new design is required to address these concerns on the Glenshane Pass and avoid a potential serious incident.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Schools are closed to all but the children of what the government has termed ‘key workers’ and parents are coming to terms with the challenge of ad-hoc home-schooling. The prospect of a y period off school may thrill pupils and terry parents in equal measure, but this is by no means an extended summer break. Here are some strategies you can use to help you and your child make it through what could be a tricky period for family relations. Create structure to the day googletag.cmd.push Many childrenthrive on the routine that their school day provides. Try to replicate this at home by setting out a timetable for study. Twitter user @andyharley has compiled a collection of graphics that can be used to create a home timetable to keep children aware of how their day will develop. This is particularly useful for children with special educational needs who may find the change in routine a little overwhelming. Read, read, read!  Long periods of time in the house are perfect for burying yourself in a good book. Now is a perfect time to escapism and what better way for a child to find it  googletag.cmd.push Local libraries have all shut their doors, but parents have a chance to sign up and download eBooks and audiobooks to keep their children reading. Oliver Jeffers, author of favourites like The Day the Crayons Quit and How to Catch a Star, is hosting a live reading every evening at pm on his Instagram page @oliverjeffers. This is a great chance for children to experience familiar books brought to le by the author who created them.Leading audiobook company Audible have also released a collection of stories available for children to stream online via this link. Keep responding to reading  A large part of the guided reading curriculum in school involves responding to what they are reading. While some readers may remember copious comprehension questions from their time at school, there are a number of activities that can be used to help with this. St Peter’s and St Paul’s, Foreglen principal Michael O’Kane has posted  guided reading activities that can be downloaded via PDF, PowerPoint or Keynote via his Twitter account. Mathletics – www.mathletics  Some of you may already be familiar with Mathletics as it is used in a number of schools. If not – get involved! Students can design their own avatar and compete against each other in a iety of challenges, activities and games. If your child is using the programme through school, they will have a log-in of their own, or you can sign up as a Home User on their website for a -hour free trial. There are plenty more free maths activities online – Topmarks, Maths Zone and Math Playground are just three examples. Google is your friend. Lego challenges An age-old favourite, Lego has been entertaining children and adults since its inception in . Many schools operate after-school Lego clubs and it has remained a staple favourite for Golden Time on Friday afternoons across the sector. Blogger Christina Shirley has shared a resource on her website that lists  days’ worth of Lego challenges for parents and children to get through. Of course, once the  days are up and you’ve got the hang of it, you can have a go at setting your child challenges yourself! Learn a language  I have banged the bilingualism drum for many years and now that the unexpected closures have left you with some time, now is the perfect time to learn a language. Duolingo has over  languages available on their online service and is an interactive way to pick up a language. While more suited to older users, this activity could be done together by parents and children, and the app is available to download on most devices.  Get activeBeing stuck at home all day can tempt many children into sedentary habits, but one of the most effective ways to ensure concentration is to get moving. Many schools operate brain breaks between lessons as well as the usual break and lunch play time and have found it increases pupil engagement and achievement. There are plenty of online videos that guide children through short bursts of exercise that are ideal for slotting into children’s timetables for a quick workout. Joe Wickshas been entertaining children on his YouTube channel since the beginning of lockdown and helping them stay alert and engaged. Keep an eye on your local GAA club too, as most have set challenges for their young players! Virtual museum tours  In the modern age, many museums can be accessed remotely via the internet. Website Southern Living has compiled a list of  famous museums that you can tour from the comfort of your own home. Write about it  Given a purpose and an audience, children love to write. With all that time going spare, encourage them to put pen to paperand create. If they are recording a diary of their time in lockdown, encourage them not only to focus on what is happening around them, but how they feel about it. Unprecedented situations can force creativity to the surface as a coping mechanism. We are happy to take submissions from children, young and old. Scan their work, take a photo, or email it to us via editor@derrynews.net,editor@derrypostor liam@derrypostand you could find yourself looking proudly at your work in the following week’s paper! Finally…forget all the above!  As much as we try and maintain as normal a routine as possible, these are not normal times, and worrying about your child falling behind in school is not the priority. Make use of the school packs, ideas and resources as much as you can but remember – this is not worth having a row about. Tension is already too high. Many parents are working from home while trying to balance childcare and the fuses may be running quite short, but children are in a vulnerable place. They have ied understanding of the situation. Some will be oblivious, some will sense the worried atmosphere and others may be concerned for the safety of elderly relatives. Get them out and about – social distancing permitting, and only once a day! – and use the time to let them experience the world around them. Go to the beach. Walk in the forest. Laugh. Eventually the world willto normal and children will tell anyone who will listen in years to come that they lived through the coronavirus pandemic of . They won’t remember immaculate timetables, multiplication revision or even the interactive learning they’ll do online – they’ll remember how they felt and what we did about it.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At such a time we need hope and we need to be able to spread hope in a simple way.The group asks its members to light a candle each night between pm and pm as a symbol of hope. As you blow out our candles each night may you give thanks for the gt of this day, explained Mrs OHare, who decided to set up the group after a neighbour suggested she put a candle in her window.No one knows what a new day may bring, but we have the hope of tomorrow and the light of hope in our hearts. Its the members who make up the group who keep each other going. I look out the window and see the candle in my neighbours window. It is a source of strength and well as a symbol of hope, and I think we will need it more and more over the coming weeks.The group has attracted members from across the globe as far afield as Taiwan, Buenos Aires and AustraliaThe site is for people of all faiths and none, although most are Christian, said Mrs OHare.I never thought it would have so many followers.We are just happy to be able to support one another and for people to see our light through the window or online. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Gone are the days of rounding up your friends for a knock-out on the nearest piece of grass you could find. Remember headers and volleys   seconds  Last Man standing  How about playing asyou were your childhood idol whilst the sun beat down and the grass stains got on the knees of your jeans. That meant that you got your arse warmed for you by your ma because the grass stains were hard to get out. I was Mark Hughes day in and day out and was the one who could be often found trying to score overhead kicks of the Sparky iety. It wasnt just football. If you fancied a game of rounders, you welcomed anyone and everyone, andit wasnt sports related, it would have been a game of Knick-Knock, which involved knocking on some poor neighbours door and making a run for it . Another classic – Pomp Pomp, involved one person standing with their eyes closed at a lamp post whilst everyone  hid, with the purpose of ing to said lamp post to free yourself. Speed was your friend in that game, a clown who never went further than ten feet from the lamp post was the enemy.The common denominator was that we were all outside playing, all day every day, and there wasnt an evening passed when someone was called in for their bed and there began vocerous negotiations across the street MAMMY, CAN I JUST HAVE ANOTHER  MINUTES . Glorious days. Really.To kids today, its an alien concept.This coronavirus craic is no craic at all, but it has made me, as a parent of two wains that would rather stay in watching TV than breathe fresh air, dig deep for creativity. With the sun shining, I took the two of them to Malinhead on Friday, and whilst I feared they would be bored within  minutes, they actually had a ball of a time, both simultaneously and spontaneously developing an interest in amateur photography. That shared interest gave way to a miracle of sorts as well – they stopped narking at each other. It was glorious peace, for them. I was having all sorts of panic attacks because they were getting far too close to the clf edges for my liking. Of course they were nowhere near them, but my eyesight isnt what it was andI said Careful once, I must have said it  times. Mortality hits you right in the face when you become a parent – and that irrationality never leaves you. I still check them to seetheyre breathing at night, and probably will until they get their own places. googletag.cmd.push HighlightMalinhead was great, and the fresh air did a number on them as they were wrecked when they got back in the car. Yet the real highlight of the day came before Malinhead, when I took them outside for an old school game of padsy.Now, you may call it padsy, or you may call it kerby, either way, you know what Im talking about. What you may not remember is that it is brilliant craic and in these scary times, a le saver.The rules are simple, and perfect for social distancing,thats your thing with your own wains. One person stands on one side of the road, facing the other, each taking turns to throw a ball. If it hits the opposite curb you get  points and you get to stand in the middle of the road for possible -pointers.It is simple and it is fun, butyoure a competitive sort, it also scratches that itch. Finding myself losing badly to my -year old daughter, I opted for desperation, turning my back and throwing it over my head in the hope of a -pointer. I also found myself hoping for the Ultimate shot - throwing the ball over a passing car and hitting the curb to win the game outright - the fabled -pointer. Those shots are for the talented or desperate, and I was the latter. Not once did I succeed. But sure at least I tried, with my daughter feeling more and more sorry for me with every beating.I did manage to claim a victory over my son, but that was neck and neck as well, and I have a feeling that he, like his sister, pitied the old fool and gave him a sympathy win.I discovered two things playing a game I played a thousand times as a Ballymac youngster – My -pointer game is now atrocious, and thats even with my glasses on. Also, a persistent leg problem prevented me from bending down to pick up the ball with any grace at all. If there was ever a sign Im getting old, it slapped me right up the face in those moments.But enough griping – my leg is sore, my hair is grey and my eyesight is shot, but the smiles were on my wains faces, and thats all that mattered. I left them playing amongst themselves whilst I talked to a neighbour about the worry affecting us all. They played on, innocently, competitively and obliviously. Thats all that mattered.They were kids being kids.Like we all were at one time.All you need is a ball. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our communities.Other councillors who spoke at Monday nightrsquos debate included Roisin Mulgrew, Michael Savage, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold

Fountain Foodbank has launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic.The cross-community facility mdash which has seen an upsurge in demand over recent days and handed out almost  food parcels last week mdash introduced the new service this week in the wake of Mondayrsquos advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that people should avoid all ldquonon essential contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon. The contact numbers are   or email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org.Newcastle and District Football League committee members are to donate food packs to the local food banks.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :.

The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.This week, Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon confirmed that work to install the new street lights in Castlewellan will be carried out in two phases.Phase one starts next Monday and will continue until Thursday, April , while phase two is scheduled to start on Monday, April  and conclude on May .Ms Mallon said she has made clear her commitment to address the issues which matter most to the people of Northern Ireland.ldquoStreet lighting services are crucial in ensuring those driving, cycling and walking can do so safely within their communities, the minister continued.ldquoThis investment provides new LED technology along Castlewellan Main Street. It is important that adequate street lighting not only improves the quality of lighting but is more energy efficient given my commitment to climate action.The government department has confirmed that during work on the scheme, a traffic management system will be in operation between .am and pm and between pm and pm from Monday to Friday.Roads officials say that they have programmed the work operations and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but motorists are advised to expect some delays and to allow additional time when travelling in the area.And in order to help ensure the safety of road users and contractors, drivers are asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with extra care when travelling in the vicinity of the works.News of the Castlewellan investment has been welcomed by South Down MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob councillors Roiacutesiacuten Howell and Hugh Gallagher.Ms Rogan said that the investment not only will provide the latest LED technology and improve the quality of lighting, but will also be much more energy efficient. She said ldquoquality and adequate street lighting in local towns is essential for businesses and traders as well as pedestrians and other road users.Cllr Howell said while the investment is welcome, there are areas across the district awaiting street light repairs and have been for many many months. She urged Ms Mallon to make these a priority and ensure adequate investment is put into maintenance of street lighting.ldquoCertain areas have had light outages for several months and local residents are feeling very vulnerable, she added.Cllr Gallagher said the Castlewellan investment will ldquomake a dference and said it underscores the SDLP commitment to regionally balanced infrastructure.He added: ldquoI am delighted that Minister Mallon has made Castlewellan an early priority. There will be somedisruption for the next few weeks as work gets underway but the Department has provided assurances that this will be managed as much as possible so that people can get where they need to go.Roads officials say that completion of the work in Castlewellan by May  will depend on the progress of the scheme and favourable weather conditions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Supermarkets.jpg","title":"Supermarkets deal with unprecedented demand  ","story":"AMID unprecedented scenes of shopping hysteria throughout the district supermarkets have been struggling to keep stock of basic supplies.A member of staff in one major store said it was ldquolike Christmas all over again.One supermarket staff member said he had filled the shelves to capacity with toilet rolls three times by lunchtime.He said that he had been working in the store for almost  years and he had never witnessedessential supplies such as hand wipes, milk and tin foods fly off the shelves so fast.Another staff member said he was worried about the back stock running low because when that was gone, a more dficult situation could arise.Shopper Christine Toland said she is not panicking but remains worried that supermarkets may run out of essentials supplies.The Downpatrick mother said: ldquoMy mother and father in-law hope to fly over from Manchester this weekend for a visit and are worried they might come in contact with the virus.ldquoIrsquom very concerned that we may not have enough essential items for the duration of their stay.Christine added that both herself and her eight year-old daughter Cha are asthmatic andare worried this will only weaken their immune system.Meanwhile, a Downpatrick nurse said she is refusing to give into the widespread hysteria to buy more than she needs.Karen OrsquoReilly said: ldquoMy father is unable to get out so Irsquom picking up some things for him.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said the local community would become a lsquocrucial support systemrsquo as the epidemic sweeps through the country and vulnerable people are forced to self-isolate.ldquoI spent a pretty uncomfortable  hours wondering whether to try to organise something myself, or even how to do it, and then I came across the Covid- Mutual Aid UK movement, and I realised thatI could then I should, said Jo.She said the group aims to cover every home in Llandough by deploying volunteers to each street, close, and block of flats.To request assistance or offer support, contact: LlandoughMutualAid@gmail.Both groups can be contacted on their Facebook page. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.
