Here is a people willing to defend this land,\u0027 said Maduro, flanked by top Socialist Party leaders, although the defense minister and members of the military high command were absent.Any change of government will rest on a shift in allegiance within the armed forces. So far, they have stood by Maduro through two waves of street protests and a steady dismantling of democratic institutions.The office of Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino did not answer a phone call seeking comment.Maduro started a second term on Jan. 10 following a widely-boycotted election last year that many foreign governments described as a sham.Venezuela\u0027s constitution says if the presidency is determined to be vacant, new elections should be called in 30 days and that the head of congress should assume the presidency in the meantime.However, the pro-government Supreme Court has ruled that all actions taken by congress are null and void and Maduro\u0027s government has previously accused Guaido of staging a coup and threatened him with jail.          Nothing off limits: At the White House Trump was asked about use of the military and said \u0027all options are on the table.\u0027Guaido\u0027s political mentor, Leopoldo Lopez, was arrested in 2014, one of dozens of opposition activists and leaders the government jailed for seeking to overthrow Maduro through violent street demonstrations in 2014 and 2017.The Trump administration could impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil as soon as this week, according to sources. The South American country has the largest crude reserves in the world and is a major supplier to U.S. refiners, though output is hovering near 70-year lows and reaction in the oil markets was muted on Wednesday.Maduro has presided over Venezuela\u0027s spiral into its worst-ever economic crisis, with hyperinflation forecast to reach 10 million percent this year. Some 3 million Venezuelans have fled abroad over the past five years to escape widespread shortages of food and medicine.In a potent symbol of anger, demonstrators in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz on Tuesday toppled a statue of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, Maduro\u0027s heir. They broke the statue in half and dangled part of it from a bridge.\u0027We need freedom, we need this corrupt government to get out, we need to all unite, so that there is peace in Venezuela,\u0027 said Claudia Olaizola, a 54-year-old saleswoman on a march in the eastern Chacao district, a traditional opposition bastion.On bond markets, Venezuela\u0027s benchmark 2027 bond was trading above 31 cents on the dollar for the first time since May 2018, up from 22.25 cents just two weeks ago.The declaration of Guaido as interim president came as tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators poured into the streets Wednesday accusing embattled Maduro of usurping power and demand he step down as the country reels from a crushing economic crisis forcing millions to flee or go hungry.Large crowds of protesters gathered in Caracas waving flags and chanting \u0027Get out Maduro!\u0027 in what was the largest demonstration since a wave of unrest that left more than 120 dead in 2017.Pro-government demonstrators dressed in red in support of Maduro were also marching in the capital, at times crossing paths with opposition protesters and shouting \u0027sell outs\u0027 and \u0027traitors.\u0027 National guardsmen launched tear gas at anti-government protesters in the middle-class neighborhood of El Paraiso but for the most part the marches continued without conflict.\u0027Join us!\u0027 the protesters cried out to a line of officers wearing helmets and carrying shields. \u0027You are also living this crisis!\u0027The protests were called to coincide with an historic date for Venezuelans - the anniversary of the 1958 coup that overthrew military dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez.\u0027The democratic forces are here advancing,\u0027 opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said as she marched. \u0027Not so that Maduro changes but so that he leaves.\u0027Ivanka tells Venezuelan opposition trying to topple Maduro...Trump says State of the Union address is \u0027CANCELED\u0027 after...\u0027Maybe someday, he’ll have a relationship with a live human...Democrats threaten to SUBPOENA Michael Cohen after he pulls...Share this articleThe demonstration comes after a whirlwind week that saw an uprising by a tiny military unit put down by government forces, fires set during protests in poor neighborhoods and the brief detention by security forces of Guaido, the newly installed head of the opposition-controlled congress.Over the last two nights, Venezuelans angry over their country\u0027s spiraling hyperinflation, and food and medical shortages have gathered in the streets banging pots and pans and setting up barricades in protest. In the city of San Felix, residents set fire to a statue of Maduro\u0027s mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.In the southern city of Ciudad Bolivar, a 30-year-old worker, Carlos Olivares, was killed when four unidentified men descended from a beige Jeep and fired upon a crowd that was looting a store. Two more unidentified people were also killed, according to a police report of the incident, while two were injured.For much of the past two years, following a deadly crackdown on the 2017 protests and the failure of negotiations ahead of last May\u0027s boycotted presidential election, the coalition of opposition parties has been badly ided over strategy and other differences as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled the country\u0027s hyperinflation and widespread food shortages. But buoyed by unprecedented international criticism of Maduro, anti-government forces have put aside their infighting and are projecting a united front.Guaido, who is taking the reins from a long list of better-known predecessors who have been exiled, outlawed or jailed, was dragged from an SUV just over a week ago by intelligence agents but was quickly released amid an international outcry.In the run-up to Wednesday\u0027s protests, the defiant young lawmaker crisscrossed Caracas attending outdoor assemblies known as \u0027Open Cabildos\u0027 - for the revolutionary citizen councils held against Spanish colonial rule - pumping up crowds by arguing that Maduro must go for democracy to be restored.Opposition: A demonstrator with a poster board showing the prices of basic food is one of tens of thousands who have turn out against Venezuela\u0027s President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas  Time to go: Opposition members shouting slogans against Maduro have been part of  re-invigorated opposition hoping to persuade the military and the poor to shift loyalties that until recently looked solidly behind Maduro\u0027s government  Grim reality: Carmen Marcano, a Cotiza neighborhood resident, shows her wounds caused by rubber bullets fired by Venezuelan Bolivarian National Guardsmen during a protest Tuesday\u0027We are tired of this disaster,\u0027 he said Monday from the roof of a college building. \u0027We know this isn\u0027t a fight of a single day but one that requires lots of resistance.\u0027An enthusiastic crowd of students answered with shouts of \u0027Freedom!\u0027Driving the crisis was Maduro\u0027s decision to ignore international opposition and take the presidential oath on Jan. 10 for a second term widely considered illegitimate after his main opponents were banned from running against him.Guaido has been targeting his message to Venezuela\u0027s military, the traditional arbiter of political disputes.Maduro, who lacks the military pedigree of his mentor, Chavez, has sought to shore up support from the armed forces by doling out key posts to top generals, including heading the PDVSA oil monopoly that is the source of virtually all of Venezuela\u0027s export earnings.He has also been playing commander in chief, appearing last week at a military command meeting wearing camouflage fatigues and receiving the blessing of the defense minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez.But beyond the public displays of loyalty from the top brass, a number of cracks have started to appear.On Monday, Venezuelans awoke to news that a few dozen national guardsmen had taken captive a loyalist officer and seized a stockpile of assault rifles in a pre-dawn raid. The government quickly quelled the uprising, but residents in a nearby slum took to the streets to show their support for the mutineers by burning cars and throwing stones at security forces, who fired back with tear gas.Distubrances continued into Tuesday, with small pockets of unrest in a few working-class neighborhoods where the government has traditionally enjoyed strong support. More violence was reported Tuesday night.What side will they take? A heckler beside a group of Bolivarian National Guardsmen blocking a protest march against Nicolas Maduro in Caracas. The military have so far remained behind him but cracks are beginning to show\u0027People are tired of so much misery,\u0027 said Carmen Marcano, holding up her shirt to show seven buckshot wounds suffered during the clashes in the Cotiza slum next to where the rebellious guardsmen were captured.Retired Maj. Gen. Cliver Alcala, a one-time aide to Chavez and now in exile, said the opposition\u0027s newfound momentum has reverberated with the military\u0027s lower ranks, many of whom are suffering the same hardships as regular Venezuelan families.\u0027I am absolutely certain that right now, especially younger troops are asking themselves whether Maduro is their commander in chief or a usurper,\u0027 Alcala said. \u0027As we say in the barracks, hunger is the only thing that can devour fear of the government.\u0027Maduro has accused the opposition of inciting violence with the aim of provoking a bloodbath. Top socialist leaders have threatened to unleash on demonstrators menacing motorcycle gangs of pro-government die-hards known as \u0027colectivos.\u0027\u0027I demand the full rigor of the law against the fascists,\u0027 Maduro said Tuesday night, blaming what he called \u0027terrorists\u0027 allegedly linked to Guaido\u0027s Popular Will party for a fire at a cultural center named for a pro-government lawmaker murdered in 2014.He also accused U.S. Vice President Mike Pence of trying to foment unrest after Pence released a video pledging support, in Spanish, for the planned demonstrations.Though intimidation has worked for the government in the past, it may not this time, said Dimitris Pantoulas, a Caracas-based political analyst. Discontent now appears to be more widespread and the ranks of security forces and government-allied groups have been thinned by the mass exodus of mostly young Venezuelans, he said.\u0027The government is resorting to its old tricks, but the people no longer believe them,\u0027 Pantoulas said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/02/07/51E5F63400000578-0-image-a-2_1541145076241.jpg","title":"oung womans tyre blows middle outback 40C heat leaving stranded","story":"    Emma Collishaw (pictured left) said a very generous truck driver, Jason Freyling, (pictured right) helped her in her hour of needAfter trying and failing to change the tyre herself, of which Ms Collishaw admits it took her \u0027half an hour just to get the hub cap off\u0027, she decided to try and flag down a passer-by.And thankfully for Ms Collishaw, a very generous truck driver spotted her at the side of the rode and decided to  help.Schizophrenic killer \u0027thought he was saving the world\u0027 when...British parents desperate to avoid the \u00279-5 grind\u0027 now live...Share this articleTaking to her social media page to give her saviour \u0027recognition for all he had done\u0027, she explained how the man, Jason Freyling, went out of his way to help.She wrote: \u0027Not only did he help change my tyre whilst supplying me with cold drinks.

This photograph was taken by Gijsbert Hanekroot, the Netherlands\u0027 premier rock photographer at the time, who said that Bowie was his favourite musician to work with. On one occasion in 1971, Hankeroot told of how he bumped into Bowie in a canteen while he was working on lyrics for Ziggy Stardust and asked his opinion on one of the lines          Bob Dylan photographed at Madison Square Garden in New York, 1974. Hankeroot managed to inset himself in the midst of a heady time in both music and culture, living the rockstar lifestyle by proxy as he flew all over the world to photograph its biggest stars. \u0027We saw The Eagles in London, Paul McCartney in south of France, Bob Dylan in New York and the Stones in Hamburg. We visited London every two months. It was the most natural thing in the world,\u0027 he said          John Lennon and Yoko Ono photographed in Selfridges on Oxford Street in 1971. Hankeroot was best-known for working in low-light settings, such as concert halls and music venues, so this is one of his rarer daylight shots. He used darkroom techniques that lent a grainy texture to the pictures he took, which is particularly visible on the faces of his subjects          Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, smoke a cigarette somewhere in Belgium, 1976. Hankeroot was recognised for his talent in his own time, working for Dutch magazine Oort, but he left the field of music photography in the 80s and his work has gone ingored. But he is now opening a new show in Hong Kong to display a retrospective of his works          Lou Reed lights a cigarette in Amsterdam, 1972. Hankeroot liked to spend as much time as possible with his subjects, staying the full length of their set if they were playing, or \u0027until the subject was bored of me\u0027, if they were in a studio. \u0027That\u0027s the moment that he or she would stop acting or posing, those often became the best pictures,\u0027 he said  Neil Young slumps on a sofa in his hotel  in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1976 (left) while Patti Smith poses during a photo shoot in Amsterdam, exact date unknown (right). Hankeroot tried to embody the same spirit of reinvention and innovation that the musicians put into their songs in his photography, searching for new way to capture and define the seminal decade in art          Leonard Cohen, photographed on a cobbled street among pigeons, somewhere in Amsterdam in 1974.  Hankeroot was deeply embedded in the musical culture of the 1970s, by the time the following decade rolled around he decided to pursue \u0027other adventures\u0027, and now works mostly as a street photographer and documentary-maker          Frank Zappa photographed in Amsterdam in 1972. Though Hankeroot was born in Brussels, in neighbouring Belgium, he grew up in the Netherlands where he was given his first camera aged 13. At 16 he dropped out of school to pursue photography full-time and got an internship with Philip Mechanicus, where he learned to take portraits          Bryan Ferry at the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, 1976. At the time, Ferry had just released Let\u0027s Stick Together, his first solo album since Roxy Music disbanded for the first time earlier the same year. He would release In Your Mind the following year and The Bride Stripped Bare the year after that before Roxy Music reformed          Photographers crowd around Mick Jagger, who is behind the camera in the shot, as they try to get a picture of him in Hamburg, Germany, in 1970          Hankeroot began digitising his archives years ago which led to the publication of Abba...

It really isn’t’: Gary Lineker...Share this article    Missing soccer star Emiliano Sala booked his own \u0027risky\u0027 private flight across the English Channel after turning down a commercial flight from Cardiff City, it was revealed today.The £15million player was offered a flight from bosses at new club Cardiff City but wanted to make his own travel arrangements from his former club in Nantes.City chairman Mehmet Dalman (pictured) said they were \u0027still praying\u0027 for positive news but are devastated after Sala\u0027s plane disappeared on Monday night.Sala, 28, was due to join his teammates in South Wales yesterday morning for training but never arrived after his 460-mile journey from Nantes to Cardiff Airport.The plane disappeared over the Channel Islands and search teams have found no sign of a wreckage or survivors.But Mr Dalman said Sala the flight on the Piper Malibu plane - which experts described as \u0027risky\u0027 - was not booked by the club.Mr Dalman said: \u0027We spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight which, quite frankly, would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements.\u0027I can\u0027t tell you who arranged the flight because I don\u0027t know at this stage - but it certainly wasn\u0027t Cardiff City.\u0027He revealed that Cardiff\u0027s hard man manager Neil Warnock was \u0027in a state of shock\u0027 after hearing the news.                                                    The model was born in the Tres de Febrero area of the Argentine capital Buenos Aires and is believed to have been going out with the footballer for a few months last year. Reports in their home country suggest they may even have been engaged before they split up. Guernsey Police said today they are \u0027prioritising\u0027 the theory that the new £15million Cardiff City player and the pilot made it out of the wreckage found floating in the Channel last night.They are also working on three other possibilities - that the plane was grounded on dry land either in the Channel Islands or France, the pilot and Sala were picked up by a passing ship or they are dead in the water.It came as aviation experts claimed that the Piper Malibu plane that Sala was travelling in had a \u0027questionable\u0027 safety record with 55 fatal crashes including 24 since 2000.Former pilot Alastair Rosenschein said the plane may have become iced-up in the Arctic blast currently sweeping across northern Europe including the UK and France.He said: \u0027It\u0027s already a fairly risky crossing to do in a single engine aircraft, especially in winter and definitely at night. There are icing problems too. It\u0027s a strange thing to do though to go and fly over water with one engine at night in winter because if your engine goes you\u0027re going in the water\u0027. French media had reported pilot David Henderson, 60, was flying the missing Piper Malibu PA-46, which disappeared near the Channel Islands on Monday night.Mr Henderson later took to Facebook to confirm he was alive and well and it is unknown who was flying the missing PA-46.But in 2015, Mr Henderson appeared in a BBC video about his life as a transatlantic pilot and described the dangers of flying a Piper Malibu.In fact, Mr Henderson told how he would always wear a neoprene wetsuit and packed a life raft in the back to give him \u00276 or 7 or 8 hours survivability\u0027 in case he ditched into the Atlantic.He is filmed sitting in the cockpit of a plane - serial number N264DB - the same as that of the missing flight, according to reports on the Aviation Safety Network Wiki page.According to South Wales Aviation Group that same plane - a 1984 Piper serial number N264DB - took off from Rhoose, near Cardiff, on Saturday destined for Guernsey, presumed to be en route to France.Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Mr Henderson described the potential problems with the plane.\u0027One of the problems we can encounter is that ice can build up on the surfaces of the aircraft,\u0027 Mr Henderson explains.\u0027On the propeller and the wings and if it gets too great the aeroplane would ultimately stop flying.\u0027And the only way in most of the aeroplanes we fly to get rid of ice is to descend into warmer air and the ice will dissipate\u0027.

I\u0027m going to Cardiff now, crazy, and tomorrow we get going.

Banks ditch...Disturbing moment \u0027sex attacker\u0027 wipes his brow and emerges...Share this article\u0027Barclays - as you know, a major United Kingdom-based bank - was unavoidably caught up in that crisis.\u0027And we will be examining how those at the very top of the bank responded to the pressure that it created.\u0027Mr Brown told jurors that by the spring and early summer of 2008, Barclays and many other banks were \u0027under sometimes extreme pressure to raise further capital - that is to say, to raise further investment in the bank itself to secure its financial position\u0027.He said: \u0027The foundation of any bank of course is its capital base. And without a secure and confident capital base, a bank cannot conduct its business with any confidence.\u0027It was this confidence that had evaporated in the banking sector in 2007 and 2008.\u0027In June 2008 - so, getting to the early summer of that year - there was a significant need to increase the capital base at Barclays.\u0027  Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath are also facing fraud charges and are seen arriving at Southwark Crown Court today By autumn of 2008, the need to increase capital was being imposed by the Government, Mr Brown told the court.  \u0027Some United Kingdom banks had been forced into Government hands, as a Government bailout was all that they could turn to,\u0027 he said. \u0027Those at the top of Barclays were very anxious to avoid accepting Government money, thereby placing itself under greater Government control and scrutiny.\u0027It is no exaggeration to say that Barclays\u0027 future as an independent bank was in jeopardy in September and October of 2008.\u0027He said the board, which included Varley, was \u0027determined to avoid taking Government funds, convinced that doing so would render Barclays restricted in its flexibility and constrained by Government policy\u0027.Mr Brown said the further investment in the bank was to be achieved through \u0027capital raisings\u0027, a process which involved shares and other financial instruments in the bank being sold to an investor or investors at a particular price per share.He added: \u0027As is normal in such capital raisings, the investors were to be paid a fee for making their investments.\u0027In the capital raisings we are concerned with in this case, all investors are paid at the same percentage commission fee for their investment.\u0027The overall figures involved are very considerable indeed as you might expect.\u0027In June 2008, the capital raising undertaken by Barclays secured £4.4 billion.          Varley (right) leaving Southwark Crown Court on January 14 \u0027In October 2008, when further shoring up of Barclays\u0027 capital ratios was imposed upon it, it raised a total of £6.8 billion.\u0027As we shall see, during these capital raisings, the Qataris in particular - through the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and Qatar Holding - the Qataris made what were very substantial investments in Barclays to shore up their capital base: approximately £1.9 billion in June 2008 and £2.05 billion in November 2008 when the Qatari money was essential.\u0027Those within the bank at that time commented that without it the consequences would be dire - for the bank and personally.\u0027Mr Brown told the jury that when a capital raising of this type takes place, there is an obligation on a bank to tell the shareholders, the investors and the wider market what has taken place.\u0027As all those involved in transactions of this nature know, there is a legal requirement that the information published by Barclays in this case is honest and accurate. That will be no surprise to you of course.\u0027It ensures that there is transparency and that existing investors, prospective investors and the wider market are properly informed about what has happened.\u0027All experienced bankers know about the fundamental principles attaching to the contents of such public-facing documents, not least that they must contain the truth and must not mislead.\u0027In this case, in addition to the amounts which Barclays revealed that it was paying to the investors in the public-facing documents, additional commission fees for investing were paid to the Qataris ... that were not paid to other investors and were not revealed.\u0027It is the hiding of these additional commission fees which lies at the heart of this case and the conspiracies alleged against the defendants, disguising and hiding extra fees to the tune, ultimately, of a total of nearly a third of a billion pounds, £322 million.\u0027Mr Brown said the commission fees were hidden in two agreements described as Advisory Service Agreements (ASAs).He said: \u0027The evidence demonstrates that the Qataris drove a hard bargain.\u0027Mr Brown explained that they received more than double the commission fee of other investors in the bank.The court heard that when a capital raising takes place the bank is obliged to tell shareholders, investors and the wider market.He explained this process of \u0027disclosure\u0027 is made through public documents, the key one being a Prospectus.He said: \u0027The Prospectuses contained statements as to the amounts of fees and commissions being paid to investors, and the overall costs of the capital raisings, which took no account of the fees payable under the ASAs. Public announcements made by Barclays were to the same effect.\u0027Likewise, Subscription Agreements made between Barclays, and the Qataris and other key investors in both capital raisings referred only to the disclosed fees and commissions and contained warranties to the effect that there were no other fees or commissions payable by Barclays in connection with the investments being made.\u0027Say the prosecution, in respect of the Qatari investment, that was plainly a lie.\u0027Mr Brown said the Prosecution claims that each of the defendants entered into the agreements alleged against them with the intention that one or more of their number would make the false representation that the only fees payable to the Qataris for their investments were the fees disclosed in the Prospectuses and Subscription Agreements.          The accusations of wrongdoing at Barclays date to around the time of the financial crisis  \u0027What matters is whether that each of the iniduals entered into the criminal agreement with the intent that the offence of fraud by false representations would be committed by one or more of their number.\u0027As a matter of law, once they had entered into that agreement, that criminal agreement, the offence is complete. Nothing in fact need be done in pursuit of that agreement,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown added that in this case the agreement was brought into effect because the false representations were made to the other investors. \u0027The evidence demonstrates that each of the iniduals joined in the conspiracies alleged against them and when they did, they intended that the offences of fraud by false representations would be made by one or more of the conspirators,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown told the jury: \u0027The conspiracies to make false representations were entered into with the intention that by making the false representations, the conspirators would make gain for themselves or another, cause loss to another or at the very least, expose another to the risk of loss.\u0027What that means on the facts of this case is that the conspirators intended, principally, that Barclays would gain by the making of the false representations.\u0027Barclays would gain because it would secure the Qatari investment, on the terms demanded by the Qataris, without revealing the true position to other investors and the wider market.\u0027He said this meant that Barclays would gain by avoiding paying others at the same rate.\u0027By depriving the other investors of knowing the truth, at the very least it exposed those other investors to a risk of loss.\u0027Had they known about the true position, contrary to the intention of the conspirators, the other investors may not have chosen to invest at all, or, more likely, would have demanded the same terms as the Qataris.\u0027By making the false representations, hiding the true position, they denied the other investors the opportunity to make that decision for themselves.\u0027That, at the very least, say the Crown, exposed them to the risk of loss.\u0027The loss being that they invested in Barclays when they may not have chosen to do so, or not on the terms that they did, had they known the true position,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown said the bank also stood to gain by \u0027avoiding looking weak to the market by for example having to pay all investors at the higher rate, and it would gain by securing the capital raisings as a whole\u0027.The defendants themselves also had personal motivations, namely their jobs and potentially \u0027very large bonuses\u0027, the court heard.The jury was told: \u0027The security of their jobs and the very large bonuses that they might receive in addition to their salaries were in jeopardy if the future and the security of the bank was in doubt, or placed in the hands of the UK Government.\u0027Varley, 62, of west London, Jenkins, 63, of Malibu, California, Boath, 60, of Henley-on-Thames, and Kalaris, 63, of south-west London, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays\u0027 June 2008 capital raising.Varley and Jenkins are charged with a second count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays\u0027 October 2008 capital raising.Jenkins is a former executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa, Barclays Capital.Boath is former Barclays Capital head of European Financial Institutions Group.Kalaris is former chief executive of Barclays wealth management. The four men deny the charges against them."},{"url":null,"title":"Theresa Mays deal acceptable Brexit outcome voters","story":"    Research by Number Cruncher Politics found Theresa May\u0027s prosed Brexit deal was the least isive for votersMeanwhile, no-deal Brexit was backed by 45 per cent and unacceptable to 39 per cent. But by contrast.

If passed, Mrs May would have three weeks to win a vote on her Brexit deal in Parliament before being required to seek an extension of Article 50.With Labour hinting it will back Miss Cooper’s bid, and a number of Tory Remainers also indicating support, the move has a realistic chance of success.Instagram \u0027ghouls\u0027 are accused of making \u0027suicide porn\u0027...Father of 14-year-old girl who took her own life after...Share this articleAllies of the Prime Minister fear the move would release the pressure on the EU to compromise – and believe that it would leave ministers until only February 5 to come forward with a new plan.One said: ‘Yvette Cooper’s amendment is of a different order to the others. The rest are expressions of parliamentary will – in theory, she could ignore them.‘But Cooper is proposing legislation. If that passes there is nothing we can do.‘It’s massively unhelpful. We’d have a week to try to persuade the Commons not to back the bill or Brexit would be delayed and the pressure would come off the EU.’Miss Cooper’s bid to seize control of the Brexit process will be debated and voted on by MPs on Tuesday.Her proposal, drawn up in conjunction with former Tory minister Nick Boles, would tear up Britain’s constitutional conventions and allow backbench MPs to push through legislation in the face of Government opposition.          Theresa May has to return to Parliament later this month with her new Brexit dealLabour yesterday signalled it would back the controversial bid to delay Brexit.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was ‘highly likely’ that Labour would support the move, although he suggested it might push for the Brexit delay to be limited to three months.He added: ‘Yvette Cooper has put an amendment down, which I think is sensible... so I think it’s increasingly likely already that we’ll have to take that option because the Government has run the clock down.’Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett argued that the plan would help stop a No Deal Brexit, adding: ‘If a resolution comes forward, in principle yes we can back it.’ A spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn, who held private talks with Miss Cooper about the issue last night, suggested the Labour leader might even be prepared to open talks with Mrs May if the prospect of a No Deal Brexit is pushed back.Eight pro-Remain Tory MPs have also backed the plan, with more expected to follow suit in the coming days. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has urged Mrs May to allow a free vote – and warned that a string of ministers could resign to back the proposal if she does not.But some Labour MPs in Brexit supporting areas are opposed to the move, meaning Tuesday night’s vote could be tight.Former minister Caroline Flint yesterday indicated she would oppose the plan and said those pushing it ‘don’t want to leave the EU and are using Parliament to frustrate the process’.Dr Fox also questioned the motives of those behind the plan, saying: ‘There are many who talk about delaying Brexit when what they really mean is not having Brexit at all.’ He warned that overturning the referendum result would lead to ‘calamitous’ political consequences.Extending Article 50 would also require the unanimous consent of the other 27 EU countries.Pierre Moscovici, EU commissioner for economic affairs, said this would be granted only if it was clear that the UK had an alternative plan it needed time to implement.He told Bloomberg News: ‘An extension is a possible scenario, but for that there are two things required. First, we have to have unanimity on that.‘I am not so worried about that, because until now the 27 have been united, and I don’t see why that would change. Second, you need to have a reasoned request (from the UK), meaning we are not going to extend just because we are not there. We need to know why we extend. What for? What is the plan?’The development came as Downing Street confirmed Theresa May and her husband Philip hosted a private dinner at Chequers for DUP leader Arlene Foster, her deputy Nigel Dodds and their partners as part of a Brexit charm offensive.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned British MPs that ‘opposing a No Deal will not stop a No Deal from happening’ unless they agree to support an alternative.Mrs May invited Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford to join a Cabinet committee preparing the UK for Brexit, with or without a deal.George Osborne warned that a hardcore of Tory Remainers would side with Labour to force a general election if Mrs May tries to take Britain out of the EU without a deal. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cce10e201f0ceba740f34f5308aaab565ab3419/0_1749_5484_3288/master/5484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2561bc33f2d6e950558f7de97e73a99","title":"rory lewis best photograph david cameron looks back without regret brexit","story":"‘I took this a year after he resigned. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really’ This picture has actually lost me a few jobs. Plus I think I might even have lost a flat because of it. I was looking at a property and was chatting to the estate agent and told them that I’d recently shot David Cameron. We put an offer in – for the asking price – but it was turned down. So yes, I do suspect people don’t like David Cameron.But when you shoot someone like Cameron, though, you have to remain neutral. If you turn up thinking too many things then you’ll inevitably forget something, or position the lighting wrong, and the subject will get irritated. You have to go in with clarity. Whether you’re a former prime minister or a bus driver, I’ll always have the same clarity of thought.The photograph came about as part of a project I was working on, aiming to capture interesting faces in the style of artists such as Holbein and Caravaggio. It took place in Cameron’s office, almost exactly one year after his resignation. My degree is in medieval history, and so shooting people who are part of our history like this gives me an excuse to touch history.He arrived in his gym clothing, which was rather funny, and he was worried he looked a bit pasty. I explained my ideas, and about how I wanted to capture this sort of meditative statesman feeling. I wanted a sense of looking backwards at the current political situation.I was worried that Cameron might be a difficult person to photograph, but as a sitter he proved to be a darling. He had a lot of patience. You have to separate politics from the person, and he was a charming chap.I knew the public would be wondering, what is he thinking? That’s why I wanted him in this pose, shot in profile. There are no other pictures of Cameron like this – the others normally capture the signature “call me Dave” look. But now he’s not in power he can afford to show more emotion and try different poses.I do think the contemplation was genuine. I’ve worked with a lot of actors in Los Angeles so I know what faking it looks like. I’ve also worked with many politicians, both Conservative and Labour, and when I ask for a certain look, some of them can turn around instantly with that expression. But David seemed to me a genuine guy, a family man, who had a real sense of the seriousness of office. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really.However, I never mentioned the B-word during the half hour we had for the sitting. I decided that wouldn’t have been a good idea. But he seemed very happy to talk about other things throughout his career. He told me that the most interesting place he’d visited was Libya after Gaddafi.I was inspired by Sir James Guthrie, the realist painter who depicted a lot of politicians straight after the first world war. They’d experienced all that horror and history, and he captured that moment. Backdrops are important for me. Guthrie painted in a muddy brown, suggestive of the trenches. I went with a fading blue backdrop. You can interpret that as the European flag fading away, or simply as the blue of Conservatism.I’m a realist photographer so I like to capture everything – the grey hairs, blotchy skin, all the details and lines. I want to say – this was the true image of David Cameron at this moment in history.He’s not the first leader I’ve photographed – I did John Major back in 2017 for another project. When I went to shoot him there was a sense of betrayal there. It was in his mouth, in his breath. But with David there was not that sense. He was energetic, almost raring to go. There was a restlessness I could really sense. I think he wants to return after this Brexit situation is resolved. I think he’ll be back.Born: Chester, 1982.Training: King’s College London.Influences: Caravaggio, Titian, Ribera, HolbeinHigh point: ‘Sir Patrick Stewart portrait sitting, New York.’Low point: ‘Not picking up a camera after I graduated.’Top tip: ‘Direction, direction, direction: break the ice with your subjects.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc4dd35aa5df567438215c148ab3b7230f71791b/0_0_1244_1432/master/1244.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25a10f449532072a6231a6e18c476f51 700w","title":"patisserie valerie cafes shut old compton street london","story":"Original outlet in London’s Soho among those closed at cost of 920 jobsLuke Johnson, the multimillionaire chairman of collapsed cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, has extracted more than £40m from the business since the cafe group floated on the stock market less than five years ago.Other shareholders are considering legal action after their investments in Patisserie Holdings, the parent company of brands including Patisserie Valerie, Druckers Vienna Patisserie and Philpotts, were wiped out when the business went into administration on Tuesday.More than 900 staff have already lost their jobs as the administrator, KPMG, announced on Wednesday that 71 outlets had closed immediately, including the original Patisserie Valerie outlet, which has been trading on Old Compton Street in central London since the 1940s.The company has been in crisis since October, when a £40m black hole in its finances was blamed on “potentially fraudulent” accounting irregularities. Earlier this week the company said it had been unable to renew its bank facilities as a “direct result of the significant fraud”.In November it secured £15m in new cash from shareholders in a bid to keep trading.Johnson, who bought Patisserie Valerie in 2006, sold nearly £23m of shares when the company floated in 2014 and nearly £13m a year later and has also collected idends and a £60,000 a year salary. There is no suggestion that the entrepreneur was involved in any fraudulent activity.He has loaned the company a net £13m in recent months, most of which is unlikely to be paid back.Former chief executive Paul May took out nearly £11m in share sales, pay and idends, including more than £2.6m in profits on sales of share options last year, according to  research. Former finance director Chris Marsh made more than £4.4m including profits of £2m on share options in 2018.Marsh was arrested by Hertfordshire police and bailed in October. He resigned that month.The Unite union blamed government inaction over financial regulation for putting jobs at riskUnite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: “Workers at Patisserie Valerie are the innocent victims of bandit capitalism, they have been failed by the government which has failed to take action to end these practices.“This latest corporate collapse demonstrates why the financial regulators are not fit for purpose, they need to be able to take action before a company collapses, rather than after jobs are lost.“Since Carillion’s collapse the government has continued as though it is business as normal and has ignored all suggestions to initiate vitally needed reforms.”The administrators running the collapsed cafe group said they are “hopeful of a positive outcome” for the remains of the business even though more than a third of its outlets have already closed with the loss of 920 jobs.Patisserie Valerie on Old Compton Street closed on Tuesday night, along with 51 of the chain’s other outlets including concessions in Debenhams and Next. The entire 19-strong Druckers cafe chain has also closed.David Costley-Wood, a partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said the group’s remaining 122 outlets would continue to trade while the administrators seek a buyer for the business.“Since our appointment less than 24 hours ago, we have been pleased with the level of interest we have received in the business,” he said.“In the meantime, we can reassure customers that across the remaining 122 stores, it is all but business as usual.”The chief executive of Patisserie Holdings, Steve Francis, who stepped in to try and turn the company around after the potential fraud emerged, said the administration was a “genuinely positive development”.“I would rather have 2,000 fully employed staff than 3,000 with no future,” he told The Grocer trade journal.He said the “cloak of uncertainty” surrounding the details of the group’s accounts including its profitability meant that “no half sensible banker was going to back that situation”. visited a number of central London stores where staff claimed they had not been briefed on their future yet. “We haven’t been told anything,” said one. “We are working as normal.”In another of its cafes, a waitress said she did not know where she would go if she lost her job, adding: “For the moment, we are open.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf5aa4ddd3c6d0eef8b221b20692dd9997a14b/0_8_2449_1469/master/2449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88e48bcf9e1dff0b8aafcc9c4c1f8549","title":"which is the worlds most lgbt friendly city","story":"Even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different storyAmid a mass of colour and pounding Latin rhythms, revellers at this year’s Bogotá Pride march waved banners stating “not one step back”. They were among tens of thousands who took to the streets to celebrate and support Colombia’s LGBT community.Many annual Pride marches that were once solemn protests against repression have become celebrations of now-existing rights or progress, reflecting the strength of LGBT communities. In Bogotá, for example, the capital of a macho and socially conservative country, there has been surprising progress in LGBT rights.In March, Angélica Lozano Correa, a former member of the Bogotá city council, became the first openly LGBT person to be elected to the country’s Senate. In 2016 the country’s government passed laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt and marry, and the previous year it granted transgender people the right to change their identity on official government documents – policies which have allowed more equality and openness.But while these laws and political representation might suggest Bogotá is “friendly” and tolerant of the LGBT community, the issue is not clear-cut. This year’s Bogotá Pride march was marked by an undertone of resistance to and fear of the right-wing government of the new president, Ivan Duque.Duque openly opposes the LGBT-inclusive peace agreement his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed with leftist rebels Farc in 2016. Activists claim he is also against same-sex marriage and adoption rights.“Although the government promised there would be no setbacks to LGBT rights, the appointment of several anti-LGBT officials, cuts in resources for public policies and the continued strengthening of radical religious movements that promote hate speech and misinformation against the LGBT population are worrying,” says Marcela Sánchez, director of Colombia Diversa, a leading LGBT rights organisation.Indeed, determining a city’s attitude towards the LGBT community is complex. Studies that try to do this often look at political or legal metrics such as freedom to marry, or laws protecting against discrimination.Equaldex, a collaborative knowledge base for the global LGBT movement that maps the legality of homosexuality, identifies a number of factors including freedom to change gender and to adopt – although it hasn’t ranked countries or cities in order of best to worst.An index from the Human Rights Campaign looks at municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership’s public position on equality across the US.Seventy-eight out of 506 US cities had a “perfect score” of 100, for reasons such as introducing trans-inclusive health benefits to city employees, as in Brookings, South Dakota. Birmingham, Alabama, obtained a full score for passing comprehensive nondiscrimination ordinances, along with other cities such as Cleveland in Ohio, a state that had previously prohibited same-sex marriage and civil unions.However, the Human Rights Campaign clearly states its index does not and cannot reflect a city’s friendliness.Other global surveys have tried to assess friendliness by covering public attitudes, access to nightlife and personal safety. A 2017 survey by the housing website Nestpick ranked the best LGBT cities by asking thousands of people how friendly they felt their city was based on safety and nightlife. Madrid, Amsterdam and Toronto came out as the top three.Arguably the size of the LGBT population in urban areas could reflect the level of friendliness, as “many LGBTI folk head to cities from rural areas because of the promise of a freer, more tolerant life there,” says André du Plessis, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.But even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different story.Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro, has been branding itself as an LGBT tourist destination for years. It has made huge efforts in providing anti-bullying projects aimed at students, and has outlawed discrimination in nightclubs. However, the last year has seen record numbers of violent attacks against the queer community.And with a newly elected far-right government, there are fears it could get worse.Conversely, in some countries with backward and dangerous attitudes to the LGBT community, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, discreet but vibrant underground scenes can thrive. This is even the case in Russia, where activists say two people were killed last week and nearly 40 detained, as part of a new homophobic crackdown by police in the Chechnya region.“You’ll find a gay scene in many places that may surprise you,” says Ed Salvato, an LGBT travel expert. “Some places like Moscow and St Petersburghave vibrant gay communities, despite the homophobic laws there.”In Dublin, an exciting scene exploded out of a staunchly Catholic country.“Dublin is like gay Disneyland now, and that wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago,” says Prof Andrew Reynolds, founder of the University of North Carolina’s LGBTQ Representation and Rights Research Initiative.“With the last couple of referendums, Ireland and Dublin have embraced their new presentation as an inclusive, progressive and loving place.”He says: “They went to Australia. They went to America. Now they’ve come home.”The political glass ceiling has broken for many LGBT people across the world, which inevitably has ripple effects on the community. Minneapolis made US history last year by electing Andrea Jenkins, the first openly trans woman of colour to office in 2017. The gay stronghold of Palm Springs, California, has elected an entire city council that identifies as LGBT. And in November, Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to be elected as a US state governor.In Poland, one of Europe’s most Catholic and conservative countries, voters in the small city of Slupsk this year elected a gay atheist mayor, Robert Biedron. Just a few years ago, Biedron was attacked on the streets of his city because of his sexuality.In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunil Pant became Asia’s first openly gay federal-level elected official in 2008, resulting in a spate of public scrutiny.“I think that the spinoff is that Kathmandu is a lot more gay-friendly than it was before,” says Reynolds. “Whilst it is not perfect by any stretch, like Bogotá, it is a place now that I feel like is much more friendly and accepting – and that’s obviously coming from a place where the Hindu religion was not helpful before.”As the most direct representatives of citizens, city officials are uniquely positioned to understand and address the needs of their communities, says Xavier Persad of the Human Rights Campaign, pointing to “the need to provide for one’s family without the fear of being fired, to secure housing without the fear of eviction, and to participate in community life”.“When cities enact LGBTQ-inclusive protections,” he adds, “they send a clear message that they value and welcome everyone, attracting the country’s top talent and spurring economic growth.”Ultimately, even the most progressive laws and equal representation at political levels do not necessarily reflect the efficiency of enforcement, or indeed capture the lived experience of discrimination and fear many LGBT people face every day.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04dc981106ad569046908624ba8a4897e7139225/182_274_2970_1781/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcd0c5fe1093cdcb3291d007a187a02f","title":"irish readers citizens assembly worked brexit","story":"Ireland’s assembly of 99 citizens found consensus on emotive issues – a model readers think could help the Brexit processWhile the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on, several outcomes are on the table, including the possibility of a second referendum. Some, including this newspaper, have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen, a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades: abortion.We wanted to find out from Irish citizens why they felt the assembly helped to bring about consensus. Here’s what some of them said.Dee, works in education, County Louth Abortion has long been considered politically toxic in Ireland, with our elected representatives loth to touch it in case it alienated their constituents and risked their political careers. The Citizens’ Assembly took the debate out of this realm of fearful self-interested calculation and into a forum where evidence and experience could take centre stage. Interest in the workings of the assembly meant that the media could report on this evidence, leading to a better-informed public and lessening the hysteria that circulates around debates based on dogma. It led to a growing realisation that the 8th amendment affected people in a wide variety of ways even during wanted pregnancies, and revealed the chilling effect it had on medical professionals’ ability to provide necessary healthcare. The members of the assembly were faced with expert testimony on medical and legal matters but also testimony from their fellow citizens whose lives were deeply impacted by the 8th.It meant that there was a long lead-in to the referendum during which debate was reasoned and detailed, before the inevitable agitation of the campaign itself. The fact that it was citizens who recommended the terms of the referendum and informed the proposed legislation introduced greater clarity, and meant voters did not just have to trust politicians since a representative body of their fellow citizens had carefully reflected on the matter and recommended these changes following significant education and deep reflection on the situation. I think the success of the Citizens’ Assembly is evidenced by the fact that the proportion in favour of repeal mirrored so closely the final vote.I was initially very sceptical. The previous discussions on abortion were rife with emotion, and the country was very ided. I was dreading the decisive nature of what I thought was a cop-out. However, I was completely wrong. Issues were discussed logically and with complete transparency and fairness. The result was a revelation in many ways. The extreme for and against arguments were shown to be just that: extreme arguments. The plain, simple facts were what mattered and brought logic to an apparently intractable issue.It is an unbeatable process. I think it would have helped the whole Brexit process had it been followed. However, Ireland had to go through years of hell to finally use it. A shame that our friends and neighbours did not follow it, but then a nation has to have its own learning curve.The Citizens’ Assembly meant the discussion about our abortion laws was led by the people rather than politicians. It’s interesting to see international interest in it, as at the time a lot of people felt it was set up as a way of kicking the can down the road. An awful lot of people against the 8th amendment were calling for the assembly to be scrapped and wanted an immediate referendum. The sentiment was understandable but I personally felt it would have been incredibly irresponsible and undemocratic to hold a referendum on revoking the 8th amendment without having proposed legislation as to what would go in its place. It is absolutely critical that people understand what it is they are voting for.Crucially, a citizens’ assembly is non-partisan and so it creates a people-led discussion and understanding of an issue. I think this also helps create a debate that isn’t dominated by black-and-white mantras from political parties but a more nuanced discussion of the issue in question. Furthermore, politics can feel far removed from the average person and so the discussion and findings can feel far more relatable.There was no trouble accessing the assembly findings as every time they met, the national TV channel, the newspapers and online-only news forums comprehensively reported the assembly’s activities. Unless you chose to stick your head in the clouds, you could not avoid hearing or reading about the assembly. This was not done in an overbearing way, as initially the assembly met once a month, so you were content to tune in to update yourself. I feel this was very important for people who never would have considered voting in favour of abortion. It motivated young people to vote for a subject very important to them, and opened up debate among people in general. The greatest thing the assembly did was get balanced and truthful information out among the people of Ireland.A citizens’ assembly has revealed itself to me to be a vital tool in a democracy – it takes the debating of a contentious issue right back down into the hands of people on the electoral roll. This is great as our politicians are so often tied into a certain viewpoint based on political agenda, party politics or personal gain. I feel a citizens’ assembly would be a very helpful tool in the Brexit dilemma.The assembly facilitated the presentation of a whole range of views and insights on the topic. The media coverage of presentations triggered a lot of discussion. Expert input at the forum informed public opinion and thus facilitated greater understanding of the issues at play in crisis pregnancies. For many, the revelation that abortion pills could be bought on the internet was a game changer. Clearly, women taking such pills without medical supervision are seriously imperilled. The realisation that abortion was already reasonably prevalent in our society led people to see that it is best for society to accept its reality and provide for safe provision under medical care.The Citizens’ Assembly, with due thanks to its chair, provided a forum where the real story was told. The broad spectrum of experience, case histories and moral viewpoints was set out for evaluation and consideration. Misrepresentation was not an option, for proponents or opponents. There was no “bluster bus”. If there is a second Brexit referendum, it should be preceded by a citizens’ assembly, chaired by an experienced judge and supported by an expert team of fact checkers.It felt very democratic. All sides were addressed. It very much helped me – not to decide as I already knew how I was voting, but to listen, understand and develop empathy for those who planned to vote the other way. The issue was a very complex and isive one, and the Citizens’ Assembly helped the issue be seen from all sides. This is not a simple issue of right or wrong. Interpersonal discussions on the issue often became emotional, leading to them becoming deadlocked. The Citizens’ Assembly kept information flowing whether we liked to hear it or not. The fact that it was made up entirely of my peers, and that through the assembly we the voters were exposed to the thoughts and opinions of experts from both sides, very much helped to establish a belief that this was a vote of the people and that we were being given all the information available in order to make up our minds. We weren’t being preached at or lied to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deac47cabf1e2516296116ecac2461cae16854a0/0_99_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d27ae9078b660c9b20d11fbc2d8ad3a","title":"compromise brexit good friday agreement britain","story":"Brexit is a reminder that two connected things need to happen in order for a political compromise to stick. First, partisan leaders must decide that it is better than any other achievable outcome. Second, the public must also converge to give it their backing. One movement towards the treaty table without the other doesn’t cut it.The Northern Ireland peace process was a classic example of this dual process. It took many years before mutually antagonistic political leaders decided that a peace deal was better than an unwinnable war. But it took even longer for the two communities in Northern Ireland to begin to make the same move. The peace process only worked because the political deal was followed by referendums that endorsed it.Yet in comparison with Brexit it now looks relatively straightforward. This is partly because almost all the thinking about how to settle the Brexit argument focuses on Westminster. Seven days ago, in the wake of Theresa May’s drubbing over her deal, I wrote that it was now time for her to compromise on Brexit. I still think that’s true. But it skates over the question of whether the British people would see such a move as acceptable, and what might follow if they did not.Finding a compromise is formidably difficult, even in Westminster. The reasons are familiar. The two main leaders are at odds with their own parties. Parliament’s law-making procedures make it hard to intervene. The tribalism of politics makes cooperation fragile. There may be a majority against no deal, but there isn’t a majority – yet – in favour of anything.Parliament is getting heat for this failure, and the chorus is likely to grow louder next week. Yet broader opinion is ided too. There is almost no consensus among voters about what should happen now. Though MPs are often lambasted for being out of touch, the uncertainties at Westminster reflect those of the public.At a conference in London this week organised by The UK in a Changing Europe, called Brexit and Public Opinion 2019, it became clear how deep this problem has become. In his keynote address, the political scientist John Curtice argued that the practical problem with Brexit is that there is very little middle ground on which the two sides can make trades. If you are looking for a Brexit outcome that satisfies the two key tests – first, that it should have overall majority support, and second, that it should have majority support on both sides – then the search so far has been unavailing.May regards her own deal, not entirely unreasonably, as a compromise already. But it is not just the Commons that dislikes her deal. Twice as many voters oppose it as support it, though often for wildly different reasons. As Curtice put it this week, May has succeeded in uniting a ided country in opposition to the agreement she has made with the European Union.However, none of the other alternatives is popular either. Most remainers continue to support remaining, hence their backing for a second referendum. Most leavers, though, still want to leave, with the largest group of them wanting to leave even without a deal. Compromise efforts soon run into the fact that this is a party ide too. Labour is an overwhelmingly remain party. The Tories are equally emphatically for leave. Neither side is keen enough on the options in between.It is true that about a third of remainers say they could support a Norway-plus solution as a second-best – but leavers see this as very much a remainers’ compromise, because it accepts EU rules and regulations. For a proportion of leavers, a renegotiation is seen as the second-best option – but remainers are suspicious of that they see going back to Brussels as a hard-Brexit ploy. The much-touted second referendum option falls into the same ide. With opinion among Tory voters now so emphatically in the leave camp, there is little incentive for May to move in the direction of a softer Brexit, let alone a second vote.Curtice’s view is not unchallenged. In a Bloomberg article today, Matt Singh of Number Cruncher Politics argues, on the basis of NCP’s own polling, that May’s deal is in fact the closest thing to a consensus among public opinion. At first sight, this is a weird claim, since May’s deal is far less popular in Singh’s poll than either remaining in the EU or leaving with no deal. However, when people are asked if these other outcomes might be personally acceptable to them, May’s deal vaults into a narrow lead. This deal is “unloved, but it’s the closest thing to a compromise that most could live with,” Singh argues.He could be right, if Westminster opinion this week is any guide. The determination of MPs like Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles to prevent no deal may now be alarming hard-Brexit Tories who fear the process will be delayed and softened. Some of them may decide they could live with a form of May’s deal after all. If she is able to cobble together a majority, it is possible that public opinion, exhausted by Brexit, might also fall into line.It would not, though, be much of a compromise. The most obvious accommodation on Brexit – a soft exit along Norway lines – might have succeeded if David Cameron had decided to stay, if May had embraced it early on, or if Jeremy Corbyn had been a different kind of Labour leader. But those chances have come and gone. One of the striking aspects of the Brexit standoff since 2016 is not just the absence of a middle ground, but the absence of political leaders who speak for it. Brexit has had no John Hume to lay the ground for a pragmatic compromise, and no Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness to deliver it, either. Unlike in Northern Ireland’s, ours is a conflict which no leader has won the authority to try to resolve by consensus. And we shall pay the price for that for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f4f05d04e47699104a49cb58021828ccb27772/0_280_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27400fe854052542dafbd3a4b61a2ea2","title":"general election unlikely theresa may brexit","story":"And yet. May’s Brexit deal has suffered the biggest defeat in the history of British democracy. If she halved the margin of defeat in another vote, it would still find a place in the five worst parliamentary routs. How on earth is she supposed to turn a 230-vote deficit into a victory of at least one, in a matter of weeks? She won’t get a meaningful concession on the backstop from the EU: how will she get the DUP, all the hard Brexiteers of the Tory ERG and Tory remainers on side? Jacob Rees-Mogg is showing signs of surrender to May, but a hardcore would not follow him. If she is expecting mass Labour defections to back her deal, disappointment beckons. May is in an impossible situation of her own making.What of the other options? Even if the Labour leadership instructed its MPs to back a second referendum – which would immediately trigger mass resignations from its frontbench – many in leave seats would refuse to do so, as would the vast majority of Tory MPs. The numbers simply aren’t there and indeed as pre-eminent British psephologist John Curtice points out, there is no public clamour for another vote. “No deal” is not going to happen – May would face resignations, even Tory MPs abandoning the whip, if she seriously attempted it – and next week, Yvette Cooper’s amendment to block it is likely to pass.So what’s left? In our tumultuous times, things can change dramatically: perhaps parliamentary arithmetic will swing dramatically behind May, perhaps a surge in support of a second referendum will happen, perhaps a majority of MPs will somehow back a sensible compromise such as Norway plus. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.On Brexit, Labour will face unprecedented strains on its electoral coalition. It needs to avoid disillusionment leading to abstention or substantial defection among passionate remainers but the electoral reality is that most of the Tory-held seats it needs to win voted leave. One possibility is that Labour commits to renegotiate a deal and hold a referendum on its terms, with a free vote offered to Labour ministers and MPs, just as Harold Wilson did in 1975. The other is simply to pledge to renegotiate a softer Brexit. Both have their risks.Labour will have to put pressure on broadcasters not to frame the election as being about Brexit and nothing else. Even May, upon becoming prime minister, accepted that “burning injustices” led to the referendum result. Austerity, the fall in living standards, the housing crisis, struggling public services: all must be central to the debate, not just talk of customs unions and tariff-free access. After all, the next government may last for five years: it would be a travesty not to debate the full gamut of policy.Corbynism’s success depends on being seen as an insurgent movement: Labour should be brave about picking fights with vested interests. Tory threats of Labour “chaos” will look absurd after the post-2015 turmoil, and with May dangling “no deal” as a serious prospect in an election campaign, Labour will have political space to be even bolder than last time. YouGov is alone in showing Labour significantly behind: the party should embrace such polls, casting itself as the underdog.A viral social media campaign – so critical to bypassing a hostile media in 2017 – will be even more sophisticated this time around. On the ground, Momentum is already making plans for what it believes could be the biggest mobilisation of activists in the history of British democracy. Labour’s new community organising unit, led by London Citizens veteran Dan Firth, has given organising training to hundreds of activists in key marginals, built big campaign teams for prospective Labour candidates, and focused on embedding the party in previously neglected communities. An election will put this strategy to its ultimate test.Sure, it may not happen. The fact that a senior Tory figure is leaking the party’s poor electoral prospects may be an attempt to scare backbenchers into voting for May’s deal or it may be a sign that they fear she is going to roll the dice. Civil servants are certainly getting ready for a snap poll. Labour, and more importantly its supporters, must do so too. This could be the historic election that ends a generation of Thatcherite dogma, and builds an entirely new social model based on public ownership, workers’ rights, state investment and progressive taxation. They had better be prepared."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a72fdb765ceaa18b5b70d22dd11180b96ef23d9/0_35_2872_1724/master/2872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88a6d74d10f9814ec746523c67120bf0","title":"the guardian view on zimbabwes crackdown mugabe went but the regime lives on","story":"People do not always want to be proved right. Many Zimbabweans watching the brutal crackdown on protests this weekend were the same people who had celebrated Robert Mugabe’s ousting in 2017. But they had tempered their optimism by warning that only very limited and superficial improvements were likely. They predicted that the successful coup would further embolden the military, and that putting in charge the feared security chief Emmerson Mnangagwa was a recipe for further repression. Irregularities at last year’s election, and the violence used to suppress ensuing protests, made their case for them. Now reports of torture, indiscriminate beatings, live fire and arbitrary arrests have rammed it home. At least 12 people have been shot dead and hundreds have been arrested.The regime’s pronouncements on the protests have been extraordinarily mixed. It blamed the political opposition and warned that repression was “just a foretaste” then blamed shootings on criminals who stole uniforms from security forces. Mr Mnangagwa, returning from his week’s absence, then promised that “heads will roll” if it emerged that security forces had committed abuses. But the crackdown has continued.Such contradictions have prompted discussion of internal isions and of whether Mr Mnangagwa or the vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, who helped install him, have driven the hard line. Overt military intervention looks like a sign of the army’s increased confidence. But observers also suspect a “good cop, bad cop” strategy. Blaming iniduals is a ersion, as Mr Mugabe’s departure should have shown already. Zanu-PF’s elite live off the system and have few prospects outside it, but have long been riven by the struggle for power and resources. While factions rise and fall, no one inside the structure shows an interest in loosening its grip on power. As a prominent member of the Movement for Democratic Change has observed, “You can’t reform without reformers”.This makes it all the more important that others in Zimbabwe are supported. Mr Mnangagwa appears more concerned about international opinion – and the cash flows affected by it – than his predecessor. That provides an opportunity. Leaders must press Zimbabwe to halt this violence and retaliation. To lift sanctions at this moment, as the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has proposed, would send the wrong signal. The US measures are targeted at iniduals their removal is conditional on human rights improvements and their impact on the economy is negligible compared with that caused by widespread corruption. In contrast, US aid that was cut off last year should be restored to Zimbabwean rights groups, some of which are dealing now with the terrible results of the violence. The people who got Zimbabwe into this economic and political disaster cannot be expected to get it out of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b0e1980a03d6eccda064b69ab304504b0b3e822/9_13_922_553/master/922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dafb02c35be4b674e98b6628a9b708b","title":"what can we do right now about climate change","story":"Calamitous weather events and warnings from scientists that the planet is warming faster than previously believed are causing alarm.

It is predicted to achieve just a third of the 800m hoped-for extra cycling trips by 2025, with much of that predicted growth restricted to London.Rachel White of Sustrans said that when it came to active travel, “we’re doing something wrong”, while Joe Irving of Living Streets called the government’s walking targets “unambitious, conservative and cautious”, citing its ambition that people should conduct one stage of a journey on foot 300 times a year, or less than once a day. This could include walking 10 seconds to a bus stop.Roger Geffen of Cycling UK said: “It’s not about putting bike lanes in where there’s a bit of spare money and a bit of spare space – there needs to be a dense network of routes.”Geffen said that because active travel was funded from various pots, “we don’t know how much money is being spent on cycling, and we don’t know how well it’s being spent”.We know cycling is an efficient, healthy and cheap means of transport, while lessons from countries such as Denmark on the benefits of decent funding and long-term planning of dense cycle networks are readily available. We know dangerous driving and air pollution from cars kill tens of thousands a year. We know developers fail on pledges to deliver cycling, walking and public transport promises, leaving communities over-reliant on cars.We have a cycling minister in Jesse Norman who “gets” active travel and has helped drive a Highway Code review and funding for police operations and driver training, among other things.The CWIS has moved us forward a little, for the first time requiring government to set aside funding for cycling and answer to parliament on its policies, but it is a first step.As the transport committee chair, Lilian Greenwood, said, although cycling’s benefits include improving congestion, air quality, carbon emissions and physical and mental health, when it comes to government policy “clearly there’s a concern there isn’t sufficient ambition and funding and certainly that funding isn’t guaranteed for a long enough period”. She added: “It’s moving in the right direction but there’s quite a long way to go.”The government’s local cycling and walking investment plans would be a good place to start local authorities have been encouraged to draw up long-term active travel infrastructure plans but there is no money to implement them. “There is a real risk these become documents that sit on a shelf gathering dust,” said White.“We know the importance of political leadership,” Greenwood said.She said “great cycling cities” such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen “haven’t always been that way. They took a decision they wanted their city to be different and they acted on it.” As has Manchester, where big cycling and walking plans are afoot under its cycling and walking commissioner, Chris Boardman.Meanwhile, parliamentarians could look outside their windows and witness first-hand the simple brilliance of the humble cycle and the difference good infrastructure can make. The evidence is clear – now they just have to fund it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f117c7034e051ef4b7e91775b4ce9b8c4aeca0/0_2748_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a8e58ef4ee02c51718276c792121d9","title":"how to survive this bleakest of winters stomp about in chunky boots","story":"There’s nothing like a big pair of boots to make you raise your fist to the sky and say: screw you, world. And what do you know, they’re back in fashionUgh January. How am I supposed to get through this hellish month? Tanya, by emailTwo words, Tanya: chunky boots. If the 1990s was the decade that the phrase “fuck-me shoes” was coined, we are now very much in the era of “fuck-you boots”, the bigger and stompier the better. Because, let’s be honest, that is pretty much the mood we are all in these days, and all this energy has to go somewhere, and surely it is better siphoning it down to your feet than spewing it all over social media. After all, what would make you feel better in the morning – waking up exhausted because you stayed up until 2am fighting about Trump with a stranger on Facebook, or waking up happily refreshed, slipping on a pair of chunky ankle boots and stomping out the door?I have loved chunky boots since I was 14 and bought my first pair of DMs from Shellys on Kensington High Street. Not a confident teenager by nature, I realised my boots gave me that confidence you can’t walk in DM’s apologetically – you can only march defiantly, and it felt freaking great. As soon as I had paid for them, I marched straight across the road to the much-missed Kensington Market, a place I had always feared as being way too cool for me, largely because it wasn’t Kookai. I headed straight to the body-piercing booth and demanded that the punk who worked there pierce my ears. Five times: three in one ear, two in the other. And for added measure, I got my belly button done, too. OK, so it turned out the punk wasn’t that great at piercing, and to this day I have a weird grey lump in my earlobe caused by a bit of nickel that broke off from the back of an earring, mid-pierce, and I nearly passed out in pain when he drove a literal wooden stake through my tummy to pierce it. But still, as I left Ken Market that day, my ears nearly bleeding off my head, barely able to see straight because of the pain, but my feet still stomping, I had never felt so cool in my life. And the truth is, I was never that cool again.So I was delighted when my esteemed colleague Scarlett Conlon wrote on these pages at the end of last year that chunky boots are back this season, because it meant the stores would be full of chunky boots, and I would have more chance of finding my perfect pair. And over Christmas, find them I did. Part-ski boot, part-hiking boot, they are so chunky and stompy I gain at least three jolts of testosterone every time I put them on, and I love it. I wear them with shorts and tights, with miniskirts, with party dresses. I would wear them to bed but I would probably end up accidentally assaulting myself. They are the kind of boots that make you want to put on your headphones, turn up World Destruction by Time Zone and raise your fist to the sky. And really, that is all I have ever wanted from a pair of shoes.Part of being a grownup means accepting other people think differently from you, and I have slowly learned to recognise that not everyone feels the same way as me – about everything, but also about shoes, and that women who claim to love high heels (the polar opposite to stompy boots) aren’t just lying to make themselves sound glamorous. They really mean it. In this month’s Vogue, fashion editor Sophia Neophitou describes in genuinely fascinating detail her lifelong obsession with high heels, and how they made her feel “empowered”, even though “in a heel, you are always looking for danger areas – cobbles, paving stone cracks, grates – and conscious of where you are planting each foot”. Now, I try to be understanding, but, seriously, who has the time for this any more? Not even Sophia, who has had to switch to flats after an accident, and has discovered: “Now, I’m able to get up and out.”Damn right, and with stompy boots you get up and out even more quickly and with more energy. That is why I genuinely believe shoes are a feminist issue – women need shoes that give them energy and leave their minds free to dismantle the patriarchy, not worry about cobblestones. It is a dark and cold world out there at the moment, people, but don’t fear it: stomp on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

He and Sullivan also worked on the defense of the former Patriots player Aaron Hernandez.Weinstein is also bringing on attorneys Duncan Levin and Pamela Mackey, the Wall Street Journal and others reported.The parties are due in court on Friday morning before Judge James Burke, who will have to sign off on the change in lawyers.The judge last month declined to dismiss charges against Weinstein, who is accused of raping one woman and forcibly performing oral sex on another woman. Weinstein sought to toss the case based on misconduct by investigators, but the judge found there was no basis for his claim the case was tainted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9e64fb4735b58cd8fb46130d258aa339d67bc9f/0_122_5979_3587/master/5979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9faae3dcc7c8281f94cac9506d328c3","title":"the mule review clint eastwood","story":"Eastwood is the director and star of this sentimental tale of a cantankerous horticulturist who falls on hard timesTen years ago, I announced that Clint Eastwood’s movie Gran Torino surely had to be his “final acting appearance”. How very wrong. At the age of 88 – and in a not dissimilar role – he is back with formidable chutzpah, directing himself, with the crinkly-eyed grimace even more emphatically weaponised.It’s a watchable movie, loosely based on a true story there’s a nice storytelling swing to it and Eastwood is frankly far more interesting than Robert Redford was in his recent swansong. Not that this is necessarily Clint’s own acting swansong, not by any means. In old age, he has incidentally developed a walk as distinctive as John Wayne’s. His bare forearms in a short-sleeved shirt are now disconcertingly long, and have a kind of slow menacing waggle, moving in tandem with his legs as he lopes to and from the car.Eastwood plays Earl Stone, a cantankerous old geezer and prizewinning horticulturalist who has neglected his family all his life. When competition from the internet undermines his flower trade, Earl desperately needs cash and by accident falls into the highly lucrative business of running cocaine for the Mexican cartels. An old white guy in his rickety old pickup is never suspected by the cops – who are on permanent red alert for Latino-looking males. There’s an interesting scene when a panicky and entirely innocent man in this category is pulled over the police and he stammeringly tells them that this is the most dangerous five minutes of his life.Clint’s Earl is in many ways quite outrageous and it is difficult to tell how deliberate this is. He is a genial, adorable racist and sexist who tells a black family they are “negroes” and smilingly submits to their polite correction. Yet more jaw-dropping is the fact that Eastwood awards himself two scenes in which his character gets it on with two prostitutes at once. We cut away from the gruesome action reasonably tactfully, but in each case the aftermath scene makes it clear that things have gone perfectly satisfactorily.Elsewhere, Laurence Fishburne, Bradley Cooper and Michael Peña play cops whose characters and scenes are pretty perfunctorily written. It’s a sentimental tale of hokum, carried by Eastwood’s star quality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423014a7e58288329159d45a3f2f634d428a2fd7/0_183_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=203749792b239a354ea5d4705f8551e2","title":"burton albion manchester city carabao cup semi final second leg match report","story":"Manchester City may have completed one of the more predictable processions through to a Wembley final but strangely enough this felt like Burton Albion’s night. Nigel Clough’s side made light of the 55 rungs between themselves and the Carabao Cup holders to come out with their heads held high, producing an outstanding display to limit Pep Guardiola’s rejigged side to a single Sergio Agüero goal. If only this had been the first leg.Cries of “Brewers” finally rang out from the freezing sell-out crowd as the League One players, humbled so utterly in their 9-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium, did themselves proud.Mind you, City, chalking up their seventh successive win, could afford to play within themselves as they confirmed their place in the 24 February final against the winners of Thursday’s other semi-final between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.Seldom can such a big football occasion have held so little tension: a cup semi-final with nothing, realistically, to play for but pride. This was not quite the biggest match in Burton’s history – clinching promotion to the Football League 10 years ago was significant by any measure, and holding Manchester United to a goalless draw in the FA Cup here as a non-league club in 2006 was a major achievement – but the culmination of their longest-ever run in a senior cup competition remained a night to savour. So there was still a keen sense of anticipation in the freezing Staffordshire air as the League One side kicked off against the Premier League champions.The other Manchester team had brought on Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo just before the hour of that cup tie 13 years ago when Clough had to name himself on the substitutes’ bench, so thin was his Burton squad. They lost the replay at Old Trafford 5-0. Double-headers against such top clubs have helped to establish Burton on the map.There was a little debate about whether Guardiola would show Burton some sentiment in his team selection this time after that ruthless first leg. He did rotate, only retaining Danilo, Agüero and Kevin De Bruyne. So in came the likes of £60m Riyad Mahrez, the England veteran Fabian Delph among a sprinkling of youngsters, including Phil Foden.Mahrez, excluded from City’s 18-man squad as they surpassed the 100-goal mark for the season in dismantling Huddersfield Town on Sunday, had two good chances early on, arrowing just wide from an acute angle after 12 minutes and shooting narrowly beyond the top corner soon afterwards when again cutting in from the right flank.Stephen Quinn rocked into a tackle that had De Bruyne looking up in shock as he fell the Irishman was quick to raise a hand in apology even as play went on. He would not want to have been sacrificing a potential shirt swap lightly.This did serve to rattle City a tad, however, and it was from Quinn’s free‑kick wide on the right, after Delph had upended Boyce, that the latter, Burton’s leading goalscorer, spun and had a clever flick on the turn saved by Aro Muric.Normal service was resumed in the 26th minute when Agüero gave City the lead. De Bruyne swept the ball out to Mahrez who played back for City’s captain on the night to sweep home his 15th goal of the season. But Burton continued playing some slick stuff even as the ground frosted up, Will Miller curling a shot over the far top corner.Burton appeared highly unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty in the 54th minute when Danilo seemed to trip David Templeton inside the area.Their luck was in, however, when from Foden’s pullback Agüero contrived to miss the goal from six yards out. It just felt a shame this was not the first leg as Burton continued to be competitive on the night.City of course had plenty in reserve: as Agüero went off, Gabriel Jesus came on, Benjamin Mendy was given his first action since knee surgery in November and the German-born midfielder Felix Nmecha came on for his first-team debut.How Burton deserved a goal. When Boyce, running through on goal, was thwarted by Muric, Miller’s shot on the follow-up was cleared off the line by Eric García. To the neutral, it felt cruel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb2c16460dd4ad04fecdf77405eeba4c2041ca2/0_197_5912_3547/master/5912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ac74b9a998746909f2f2ccb555d7f3","title":"emiliano sala search resumes for lost plane carrying cardiff player","story":"Police to decide on Thursday whether to keep searching, as pilot is named as Dave IbbotsonRescuers fear there is little hope of finding the footballer Emiliano Sala and an experienced pilot alive after their light aircraft went missing over the Channel Islands.The search for the new Cardiff City striker Sala and the pilot, who has been named as Dave Ibbotson from Lincolnshire, was postponed as darkness fell on Guernsey on Wednesday. A decision on whether to resume the search would be made early on Thursday, police said. It is understood that a French navy vessel had been directed to the area to assist.Earlier on Wednesday, Guernsey police had raised hopes by saying searchers were focusing on the possibility that the pair had made it into a life raft. But some of those involved in the rescue said that even if this was the case, there was little chance they would have survived since Monday night in cold, choppy conditions.Sala, 28, and Ibbotson, 59, have been missing since their plane disappeared from radar over the Channel as the footballer was being flown to Cardiff having been sold to the Welsh club by Nantes for £13m.The search has focused on a 280 sq mile area north of Guernsey that is close to shipping lanes and dotted with reefs.Sala, who is Argentinian, is believed to have sent a voicemail message to his father saying he was frightened that the plane was about to break up. He said: “I’m here on a plane that looks like it’s about to fall apart, and I’m going to Cardiff … If in an hour and a half you have no news from me, I don’t know if they are going to send someone to look for me because they cannot find me, but you know … Dad, how scared am I!”Sala’s former girlfriend Berenice Schkair, 27, wrote on social media: “I want to wake up and all of this to be a lie. Please investigate because I cannot believe this accident.” In a separate post, which was later deleted, Buenos Aires-born Schkair wrote: “Investigate the football mafia, because I don’t believe this was an accident.”Ibbotson is an experienced flyer and a member of the British Parachute Association (BPA), from the small town of Crowle near Scunthorpe.Debra Middleton, the mayor of Crowle and Ealand, said Ibbotson was “very well known and very well liked” and that residents were hoping desperately for a positive outcome. “We all really do feel for his family. Everybody’s listening to the news and hoping everything’s OK.”Humberside police said: “We can confirm that north Lincolnshire man David Ibbotson is believed to be the pilot of the light aircraft that went missing near Guernsey. Specially trained officers are supporting Mr Ibbotson’s family, who have asked for privacy at this difficult time.”Guernsey police had said on Wednesday morning that rescuers were working on four possibilities:The police said the search was focusing on the life raft option.Capt David Barker, the Guernsey harbourmaster, leading the operation, said there was still a chance that the pair could be alive if they had made it into a life raft. “Nobody here, including me, is giving up,” he said.John Fitzgerald, the Channel Islands Air Search chief officer, said: “We’re out there looking for something you don’t expect to see, whether it’s a whole aircraft, a life raft or bits of whatever. We have seen lots of things in the water, but that’s not to say they’re from the plane. They could be from the ship, from the land, anywhere.”Fitzgerald suggested it was unlikely the pair would survive for days even if they were in a raft. “The sea is 8-9C. That takes your core temperature away very quickly. Unless you are in a survival suit and really know how to look after yourself, you will have severe issues.” Privately, others directly involved in the rescue said there was very little hope. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the plane was unlikely to have been fitted with a flight recorder, or black box. A vital tool for crash investigators, black boxes are mandatory on airliners and business jets, but not on light aircraft such as the Piper PA-46 Malibu that Sala was travelling in.The plane took off at 7.15pm on Monday and was flying at an altitude of 5,000ft (1,500 metres). On passing Guernsey, it “requested descent”, but Jersey air traffic control lost contact with it while it was at 2,300ft.Cardiff City said Sala had arranged the flight himself. The club chairman, Mehmet Dalman, told BBC Radio Wales: “We spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight, which would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements.” It is believed that a football agent may have helped him arrange the flight. At 5.10pm on Wednesday, Guernsey police said: “After an intensive search using multiple aircraft and one lifeboat over the last nine hours, we have found no trace of the missing plane. With the light now fading, the search will be suspended for the night. A decision about whether to recommence will be taken early tomorrow morning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa8d86fc68c6a4ba38f7db04743f77b26894e3e0/126_85_3037_1822/master/3037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e07742094a030c86f999f91c9c1f5d38","title":"frenkie de jong barcelona transfer news ajax","story":"• 21-year-old will join Barça on five-year contract on 1 July• De Jong becomes fourth signing of window at Camp NouAjax midfielder Frenkie de Jong will join Barcelona this summer on a five-year contract for €75m (£65.3m), the La Liga club have announced.The 21-year-old Netherlands international had been one of Europe’s most sought-after young players, with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain also interested in signing him.

Peter Lansley was our man at the match, and his report is here. Congratulations to Manchester City on reaching their seventh League Cup final commiserations to Burton Albion, though take nothing away from their wonderful run to the semis, and the way they bounced back from despair to give a great account of themselves tonight. Thanks for reading sweet dreams, wherever you are!And now Cloughie Jr. gives his verdict. “We came very close a couple of times, I’m very pleased with the way we played tonight and went about it. We got a bit of pride back. We showed a lot of spirit, some good youngsters as well. I thought we pressed them and did everything we could tonight. The pressure was off, of course, with the tie being over. But we put in a good performance against some top, top players. We were brave and caused them problems. I watched their last couple of Premier League games against Wolves and Huddersfield and I thought we caused them as many problems as they did. As a club, it’s been an incredible experience just to reach the last four. As a team, especially for the youngsters, it’s been incredible to be on the same pitch as those magnificent players. We take an awful lot from it, the experience and the glory of reaching the semi. Hopefully we’ve made a bit of money too. I can’t wait for Bradford on Saturday!”Pep speaks! “We worked very well. The pitch was so dangerous and slippery. But we make a good game. I am a little disappointed with our finishing, but we were good. Burton had also a couple of clear chances, and were outstanding. But we are in the final, that is what is important. I didn’t see a lack of desire, we played seriously, and we have no injuries. I am not thinking about Chelsea or Tottenham, they are both incredible teams. The important thing is again, one more year we are there.”A charming post-match interview with 18-year-old Ian Carlo Poveda. He’s a little nervous, but his joy at making his Manchester City debut tonight is infectious. “I am buzzing,” he begins, smiling shyly. “I’m just grateful for the opportunity, I couldn’t have done it without the support of my family and my friends, and the fans also.” He’s asked what it was like to play alongside the likes of Aguero and De Bruyne. “I’m just speechless to be honest, it’s an amazing feeling, I have dreamt of this.” An evening to remember for the young man.So City will play either Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur in the Wembley final on February 24. We always knew this would be the case, after that first-leg rout, so there’s little in the way of the usual manic semi-final celebrations at the final whistle. Some muted clapping, and that’s about it. The managers Nigel Clough and Pep Guardiola shake hands warmly and share a smile, just as they did at the Etihad a fortnight ago. But this time Clough’s side have given a much better account of themselves. His players look understandably deflated, but they’ve restored much pride after the horrors of the first leg, and once the sting subsides, should feel pleased with their efforts tonight, a mid-table League One outfit holding the champions of England to a single goal.... that’s the final whistle! City have reached their fourth League Cup final in six seasons! And Burton Albion have restored some pride with a staunch second-leg display.90 min +2: Danilo whips the free kick over the wall. It’s straight at Collins, who tips over with ease. The corner comes to nothing, and ...90 min +1: There will be two added minutes. In the first, McCrory races out of his own box and slams Jesus to the ground. A free kick, 25 yards out.90 min: Hutchinson shows Foden a clean pair of heels down the left. But just as Burton start to dream about the cross that leads to that precious consolation strike, Hutchinson takes a heavy touch and runs the ball out for a goal kick. 88 min: Jesus dribbles into the Burton box in the style of Ricky Villa, but can’t finish his baroque ramble. His shot is smothered by Collins, and the resulting corner comes to nothing.86 min: Nothing going on. Which explains why Kári Tulinius has started to concentrate on the pitchside advertising. “When I was a wee lad watching English football in Iceland, I would puzzle over the pitchside hoardings, trying to figure what the various exotic companies were selling. Pirelli Stadium is bringing me right back as I wonder what the heck Palletforce, Kestral and Russell are all about.” A timely email, because they’ve just this minute flashed up an ad for Don Amott caravans. Anyone who watched ATV back in the 70s and 80s will have enjoyed a Proustian rush.84 min: Garcia slips over as City knock it back and forth around the back. Daniel nearly manages to latch onto a momentarily loose ball, but Garcia recovers just in time.82 min: Harness is sent scampering into the City box down the right by Fox. He’s hassled by Mendy, then crashes into Muric, who has come out to smother. Harness wants a penalty kick, but that’s not forthcoming.81 min: City continue to hog the ball in the sterile fashion. 79 min: City stroke it around, keeping warm their only concern. Can they find the two goals that would give them the all-time League Cup aggregate victory? Or is the ten-goal semi-final record enough to sate their desires?77 min: Boyce is replaced by Daniel. Both teams have now made all their substitutions.76 min: Templeton ambles down the left, and has Hutchinson on the overlap. He eventually finds his team-mate with a pass, after plenty of faffing about, but at this point Hutchinson is offside. The pair analyse the move in the full and frank style.74 min: It’s a couple of degrees below zero now, and the pitch is hardening up. Pretty passing is at a premium right now, the ball bobbling around quite a bit. Burton will be happy enough, as it ensures City can’t be their usual fluent selves.72 min: Nmecha goes down in the Burton area, barged by Harness as he chases a Jesus pass down the inside-left channel. It was a good old-fashioned shoulder-charge, though, and the referee’s not interested in awarding a penalty kick.70 min: Burton come so close to that consolation! Sandler slips on the edge of his own box. Boyce steps into the area, but his heavy touch allows Muric to smother. The ball breaks to Miller, on the penalty spot. He slams low towards the goal, but Garcia is back on the line to spectacularly clear! Poor old Burton.69 min: Mahrez finds himself standing in the Burton D. He considers shooting, but instead slides a pass wide right for Danilo, who instantly looks for Jesus in the middle. His ball, neither cross nor shot, flashes out to the left of goal.67 min: City make their final change of the night, Zinchenko making way for debutant Felix Nmecha.65 min: Harness busies himself down the right, and nearly slips Miller free in the City box. But Garcia has read the danger well, stepping in to shield the ball out of play for a goal kick. Burton are giving it their all in pursuit of this consolation goal.63 min: Aguero has had a very strange evening indeed: some awful control, that dreadful miss, and the game’s only goal. A clinically brilliant one at that. He’s had a good run out, though, and now he makes way for Jesus. Meanwhile de Bruyne, also working his way back from injury, is replaced by Mendy, returning from a spell out himself. This is all great news for City, several of their stars sharpening up just in time for the big run-in.61 min: What a miss! Aguero backflicks deliciously down the left to send de Bruyne into space. De Bruyne then slides a pass down the channel to release Foden, who tears clear into the box, then cuts one back for Aguero. He can’t miss, but does, sending his first-time shot wide right from 12 yards under no pressure whatsoever! Replays show Foden was well offside, so it’s probably for the best.59 min: Templeton simmers down, and is again about his business, dribbling into the City box from the left again. But neither of his two attempts to cross low are any good, both blocked by his nemesis Danilo.57 min: Templeton continues to argue the toss, chuntering on at whoever will listen as play continues. It still means something, ten goals down or not.55 min: Templeton dribbles into the City box from the left and springs over Danilo’s leg. He’s livid. He’s after a penalty kick. But there was no contact, and Danilo did nothing wrong. The VAR folk - apparently working from a van in the car park, a pimped version of Andy Townsend’s old truck, perhaps? - double check, and we play on.54 min: Danilo makes space on the right and swings a low cross to the near post, where Delph must surely score. But he takes a fresh-air swipe at the ball, which then bounces back towards him off Collins, offering a second bite at the cherry. He clanks that one out of play, wide right, for a goal kick. It should have been City’s 11th goal of the tie. Hey, if you’re going to miss a sitter, now’s the time to do it.53 min: Foden probes down the City left Mahrez has a go out on the right. Neither can work a clear route into the box.51 min: Aguero dribbles down the right. He’s stopped by Wallace, who in turn is slide-tackled by ... his own man, McCrory. Burton continue to give it their all despite the ludicrous scoreline, which is very much to their credit.49 min: Garcia slips on the frosty turf and very nearly allows Boyce to race clear on goal. He does very well to recover and hack away from danger.47 min: Mahrez glides in from the right but can’t release himself into the box with a one-two with Aguero. City will be in something of a rush themselves, needing two more goals to register the biggest aggregate win in all League Cup history.45 min 21 sec. Burton have clearly come out with a flea in their ear, ordered to pick up the pace in search of this elusive consolation goal. They snap into a couple of challenges, and suddenly Templeton has possession 25 yards out. He creams a fine shot just over the bar. No time to waste.Here we go again! Burton get the second half underway, having replaced Quinn with Fox.Burton were four down at half-time a fortnight ago, so this is a most acceptable improvement. The home side will be relatively pleased with their efforts so far ... but what they’d give for a consolation goal in the second half, even if they end up shipping a few more themselves. Don’t go anywhere!45 min: Both teams appear to be waiting for the half-time whistle. Not much going on. They’ll get their wish in two minutes.43 min: Harness comes again down the right and whips a cross to the near post. But there’s nobody in yellow there, and Garcia is able to clear calmly.42 min: De Bruyne hesitates 30 yards from his own goal and has his pocket picked by Harness. For a second, City are exposed, but de Bruyne ensures Harness can’t have a clear run on goal, making up for his mistake and putting a stop to Burton’s gallop.40 min: Turner’s race is run. The big centre-half has picked up an injury, and he limps off sadly, to be replaced by Hutchinson.38 min: Boyce is sent zipping clear down the inside left by a lovely Templeton defence-splitter, but Muric is out of his box quickly to batter clear. 36 min: De Bruyne loops the set piece to the far post, where Garcia should either score or roll a pass back across goal to invite a tap-in.

What’s behind the obsessive pursuit of a flawless look?People used to call Anika the Snap Queen. Between the ages of 19 and 21, she was “obsessed with Snapchat, to the point where I had 4,000 followers”. At the peak of her “tragic” behaviour, she reckons now – a year after quitting the image-sharing app – she was taking 25 selfies a day.She liked the sense of having a platform, she says, with the average selfie getting 300 replies. “It was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m so popular – I’ve gotta show my face.’” But the filters were also part of the appeal. The Londoner had long been insecure about the slight bump in her nose. Snapchat’s fun effects, which let you embellish your selfies with dog ears, flower crowns and the like, would also erase the bump entirely. “I’d think, ‘I’d like to look how I look with this filter that makes my nose look slimmer.’”Socialising in the real world, she would choose her seat to avoid being seen in profile. She recognises that this was irrational – “but it happens. I feel like we’re in a world where a lot of people are seen to be perfect, and so we try and reach that peak.”Sometimes her followers would suggest meeting in person. “Then it would be like, ‘I have to look like my selfie.’” It was around this time, the height of her Snapchat obsession, that Anika started contacting cosmetic doctors on Instagram.The phenomenon of people requesting procedures to resemble their digital image has been referred to – sometimes flippantly, sometimes as a harbinger of end times – as “Snapchat dysmorphia”. The term was coined by the cosmetic doctor Tijion Esho, founder of the Esho clinics in London and Newcastle. He had noticed that where patients had once brought in pictures of celebrities with their ideal nose or jaw, they were now pointing to photos of themselves.While some used their selfies – typically edited with Snapchat or the airbrushing app Facetune – as a guide, others would say, “‘I want to actually look like this’, with the large eyes and the pixel-perfect skin,” says Esho. “And that’s an unrealistic, unattainable thing.”A recent report in the US medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery suggested that filtered images’ “blurring the line of reality and fantasy” could be triggering body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition where people become fixated on imagined defects in their appearance. Like Esho, Dr Wassim Taktouk uses non-surgical, non-permanent “injectables” such as Botox and dermal fillers to enlarge lips or smooth a bumpy nose. He recalls a client coming to see him in his cream-carpeted Kensington clinic, upset after a date made through an app had gone south. “When she’d met the man, he had been quite disparaging: ‘You don’t look anything like your picture.’”The woman showed Taktouk the heavily filtered image on her profile and said: “I want to look like that.” It was flawless, he says – “without a single marking of a normal human face”. He told her he couldn’t help. “If that’s the picture you’re going to put out of yourself, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.”Why do we take so many photos of ourselves? A 2017 study into “selfitis”, as the obsessive taking of selfies has been called, found a range of motivations, from seeking social status to shaking off depressive thoughts and – of course – capturing a memorable moment. Another study suggested that selfies served “a private and internal purpose”, with the majority never shared with anyone or posted anywhere – terabytes, even petabytes of photographs never to be seen by anyone other than their subject.With so much of life now lived online, from dating to job-hunting, recent, quality images of yourself are also a necessity – it is no wonder that Facetune (Apple’s most popular paid-for app of 2017) and the free follow-up Facetune2 have more than 55m users between them. Stav Tishler of Lightricks, the company behind them, says making airbrushing accessible has challenged “that illusion that ‘a perfect body’ exists … and levelled out the playing field”: “Everyone knows everyone is using it, supermodels and ‘everyday’ people alike.”Even novelty filters such as Snapchat and Instagram’s, as well as adding bunny ears or specs to your selfie, plump your lips, erase your pores and lift your jowls while they are at it. (Snapchat declined to respond on the record.)The filtered-selfie look is also reflected in demand for bigger lips and taut jawlines. Such so-called “tweakments” have exploded in recent years, thanks to their relative affordability and convenience. A “liquid nose job” using fillers might cost a few hundred pounds and takes instant effect, compared with the slow, painful recovery from a surgical rhinoplasty. Marla, 29, from New York, got her “perfect nose” last year while on her lunch break. “I went back to work feeling just so much more polished and confident – like I was even writing my emails better.”Like Anika, she had always been bothered by the bump in her nose, religiously removing it from selfies but she began exploring real-world options after a painful breakup. A list of pros and cons revealed that the potential risks – of her parents’ disapproval and “necrosis of the face” (“It’s very rare, but it’s definitely a thing”) – did not outweigh the benefits of having “the nose I create for myself on Facetune”.The rise of fillers – anything from collagen and hyaluronic acid, which break down in a matter of months, to the permanent but riskier polymethyl methacrylate beads – has been accelerated by celebrity endorsements from the likes of the Kardashian clan. The removal and subsequent return of Kylie Jenner’s lip fillers have been followed with particular interest. ) Some doctors try to capitalise on this with “the Kylie package” for nose, jaw and lips, says Taktouk, disapprovingly. Ten years ago, his clients were deeply concerned with patient confidentiality “Now, it’s ‘Do you mind if I Insta-story this?’ It’s not taboo any more.” He has seen lips advertised for £150 and noses for £200-£300. “And that’s one of the trickiest procedures of the lot.”Fillers may be less invasive than surgery, but they are not without their risks, which range from uneven results and infection to vascular blockages and even blindness. Save Face, the UK’s largest register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical treatments, says almost 1,000 complaints were made in the year to October. Yet there is little regulation and no minimum age. “We have more protections for houses than we do children’s faces,” says Esho, who has campaigned for crackdowns. “It’s crazy.”Even Marla – who documented her follow-up nose job in a short film for Vice, and does paid promotional work for cosmetic surgeons – says she would not encourage a young girl to do as she did. “I know that I love myself – that’s why I let myself get little tweaks – but it would really bother me if a young girl told me that she didn’t.”The process is as easy as “click-click-click, look at 10 bits of his work in the space of a minute, wow, let’s contact him”, says Anika. At the age of 20, she turned up at Taktouk’s clinic with photos of noses he had done and a video of herself with a Snapchat filter. “You know the one that kind of makes your face look like an alien’s? I was like, ‘This looks great – my nose looks so much smaller.’ Dr Taktouk was like: ‘This is not what is going to happen with filler.’” She laughs. “He told me to come back with my mum.”Instead, Anika took a year out to consider her decision, weighing up fillers’ merits against surgical rhinoplasty. “Actually, I went through a phase of thinking, ‘No, I should try and love myself.’” How did that go? “I didn’t do rhinoplasty,” she says drily. “I guess that’s as far as I got.” By the time she returned to Taktouk’s clinic, aged 21, she had been brought “back down to earth”. He injected filler into the tip of her nose, evening out its line. She loved it instantly. “I feel like I just needed that to change me inside, so I could stop looking for perfection.”When the filler eventually breaks down after about a year, she will repeat the procedure. “The most beautiful thing is when someone is happy from within,” she says “as ironic as it sounds”, her new nose helped her to attain it. “I’m not itching to get anything else.”There was a moment just after the procedure, though, as she was admiring her new profile, when she wondered aloud if her lips needed filling, too. They were one of her most prominent features she had been called Fish Lips at school. Taktouk told her to stop being silly. “When you’re in that seat, it’s quite tempting,” she says. “Like, ‘What else can I do?’”It prompts the question: which are you trying to correct, the image or the reality?Anna, 40, from Malvern – another patient of Taktouk’s – admits to having once been “fixated” on her laugh lines. “The photos exacerbate it, making it look worse, then a filter can make it look amazing. You’re unsure of what you look like.”Ever since she was young, she has struggled with the discrepancy between how she sees herself in the mirror, and how others see her. Once, she downloaded an app that claimed “to show you how you really look”. “It used to horrify me, and make me feel terrible about myself. But these are conversations you can’t really have, because you do sound self-absorbed and you’re leaving yourself vulnerable.”She is more self-confident now, which she attributes both to age and the occasional self-esteem boost of Botox or filler. “I’m quite realistic now, whereas in the past I’ve driven myself crazy.”For Taktouk, referrals from social media make it harder to safeguard patients’ mental health. His background as a GP has helped him to spot red flags, such as badmouthing other doctors, insisting on flaws that aren’t there, and in-depth knowledge of treatments: “I’ve had someone come in here and draw the lines on their face themselves.” But, he adds, “I’m sure some will have slipped past without me realising” – and even if Taktouk refuses to treat them, someone else will.Over the weekend it was reported that Superdrug (which began offering Botox late last year) has agreed to introduce mental health screening for people seeking Botox, following criticism from the NHS for not conducting “medically responsible” checks. Taktouk says far more industry-wide regulation is needed, before there is a headline-grabbing tragedy and apps become even more transformative. He points to one called Retouch Me, which superimposes six-packs on to swimsuit pictures. “I saw it and thought, this is the new wave of what we’re going to get in: ‘Make me look like this.’”The onset tends to occur in adolescence, though people with the condition may not seek help until 10 years later. The general rule, says Professor David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital in south London, is that you can “think about your appearance for an hour a day before it becomes a disorder” – but for a diagnosis, it must be accompanied by significant distress or inability to function normally. People with BDD take selfies because they are convinced “that they are hideous”.In 2014, then 19-year-old Danny Bowman from Northumberland was reported to be “Britain’s first selfie addict” after being interviewed about his experience of BDD. His problems had begun four years before, when he was rejected by a modelling agency at the same time as he was being bullied at his new school and on Facebook. “For me, it was confirmation that I did look ugly.”Bowman was soon spending hours before the mirror, slathering himself in acne cream and moisturiser and monitoring a steady stream of selfies for real-time improvement. After three months he dropped out of school, and the selfie-taking increased to hundreds a day. “I was trying to see some gradual improvement, and take that photo that I was pleased with. I was just trying to get that relief, and I couldn’t get it. There wasn’t a perfect photo. There isn’t a perfect photo.”After six months of being housebound, consumed by his daily rituals, he tried to kill himself. “A lot of people say looking at themselves in the mirror probably makes them feel insecure, but imagine scanning through 200 pictures a day. I was just exhausted. I felt like there was no way out.” His mother – like his father, a mental health professional – found him in time and he was diagnosed with BDD. Part of his 12-week treatment involved restricting access to his phone.Now 24, Bowman is studying at the University of York and campaigns on issues related to mental health and positive body image. He has raised concerns about the impact of Instagram with friends he sees “posting photographs of themselves every other day, Facetuning themselves, making themselves look unlike the way they look. That was me, but on an amplified scale.” They have reacted defensively, he says. “It has become such a normal thing that people don’t see what they’re doing as abnormal.”He very rarely takes selfies now. “I just don’t feel the need to do it.”• The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation can be found at bddfoundation.org "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3a24630cfedb2928e00288cee3cb2432bfe34d4/0_0_696_418/master/696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e533debcbd4f0085019879fb88b3bf3f","title":"dutch magazines reporter suspect stories","story":"Nieuwe Revu and HPDe Tijd ditch articles over unclear sources and alleged plagiarismMedia in the Netherlands and Belgium have ceased employing a freelance reporter amid allegations that he plagiarised other media and cited sources in his articles who could not be traced.The scandal represents another blow to the reputation of journalism in western Europe, following a high-profile case in Germany last month.News magazine Nieuwe Revu said on Tuesday it was withdrawing 27 articles by freelance reporter Peter Blasic, who covered general news, saying he had used sources in his stories that the magazine has been unable to track down.On Wednesday, another Dutch magazine, HPDe Tijd, said in a statement that seven of about 300 articles by Blasic it had published on its website between 2014 and 2017 had been “copied in whole or in part” from the EUobserver website, without crediting the site.Blasic, who also works as a civil servant in the southern Dutch town of Roermond, did not respond on Wednesday to calls and emails seeking comment.Belgian media also reported uncovering plagiarism and dubious sourcing in Blasic’s stories. The website Knack.be said it had published six of his articles: “Our own investigations show that Blasic never spoke to certain sources he cites in the articles and appears to have invented a number of anonymous witnesses,” the site said. It added: “Our website made a mistake. We should have seen through this fraudster.”The statements followed the publication this week by Amsterdam weekly De Groene Amsterdammer of a report outlining a string of suspect stories by Blasic in Dutch and Belgian media.The revelations come a month after German weekly Der Spiegel revealed that one of its star reporters, Claas Relotius, left the publication after committing journalistic fraud “on a grand scale” over a number of years.Tom Kellerhuis, editor-in-chief of HPDe Tijd, said his website stopped working with Blasic after discovering his alleged plagiarism in October 2017, although the site did not publicise the situation at the time.“This wasn’t about a star reporter with a formidable reputation, but a starting inexperienced ‘journalist’ who still denies his plagiarism,” Kellerhuis wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8339b4630068ac1e8e54b9335257ce5207d6539/75_0_4157_2934/master/4157.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=07e669c940744398b1e2b39107bae29d 960w","title":"david davis part time business cabinet jcb","story":"Former Brexit secretary receives £3,000 an hour for consultancy role with JCBIt is a matter for debate whether the country has fared better or worse since David Davis resigned as Brexit secretary. In much less doubt are his personal fortunes: the MP is receiving almost £100,000 from two part-time business posts.The latest register of MPs interests shows Davis has acquired two new jobs on top of his role representing Haltemprice and Howden in parliament. One, as an “external adviser” to JCB, makes him £60,000 for 20 hours of work a year.Anthony Bamford, the digger company’s chairman, is among the few high-profile businesspeople to be a strong advocate of Brexit. Bamford, a Conservative peer, quit the CBI in protest against the business group’s contrary view.Another of Davis’s new interests is as board member for Mansfelder Kupfer und Messing, a German manufacturing company, for which he is paid £36,085 for the six months from December. He is also “eligible for the management incentive plan”.For both appointments, the entry says, Davis has consulted the government’s advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), which rules on the sort of jobs former ministers and other senior government figures can do after departing, to avoid issues such as potential conflicts of interest.While MPs can take outside jobs, within certain parameters, serving ministers cannot – which can mean their overall incomes fall despite the extra ministerial salary.Geoffrey Cox, when he was made attorney general in July, had to give up his private QC activities, which made him anything up to £600,000 a year on top of his MP’s salary.The financial fortunes of Boris Johnson, who also left the cabinet in protest against Theresa May’s planned Brexit deal, have also risen since he returned to the backbenches.The register of interests shows Uxbridge and South Ruislip’s MP, who is paid almost £23,000 a month for his Daily  column, received £28,900 for a single speaking engagement in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db880319eb61ed218f4d0af274a59df5c4f1a13/0_31_3280_1969/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=545233618ead6c1ab11eb130405c9b20","title":"sadiq khan makes rent control key plank of mayor re election bid","story":"London mayor will work out blueprint for overhaul of laws for renters before 2020 pollSadiq Khan is to make a campaign for wide-ranging rent control the key plank of his 2020 re-election bid, asking the government to give the London mayoralty the power to combat soaring rents in the capital.The mayor of London is to work out a blueprint for an overhaul of the laws for private renters to allow new restrictions on rent to be imposed – a change he could not make without legislation by central government.Khan told the  the arguments for rent control were “overwhelming and Londoners overwhelmingly want it to happen”, but said he could not make the change within his current remit.“London is in the middle of a desperate housing crisis that has been generations in the making,” Khan said. “I am doing everything in my power to tackle it – including building record numbers of new social homes – but I have long been frustrated by my lack of powers to help private renters.”Recent YouGov research by City Hall, released to the , suggests that two-thirds of the 2.4 million renters in London, more than a quarter of the city, are strongly in favour of pricing controls.However, it is a plan not likely to find favour with the Conservative government. The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, has argued that the controls would lead to poorer housing standards, with landlords unable to afford to maintain properties, and could also have a dramatic effect on housing supply, with landlords choosing to sell up rather than have their rental income reduced.The blueprint for rent stabilisation and control laws will be devised by Khan’s deputy mayor for housing, James Murray, and the Westminster North MP, Karen Buck, who last year won government support for her private member’s bill to put legally binding standards on rented homes.“London’s private renters are among the worst affected by the housing crisis in the capital, and the laws to protect them are woefully out of date,” Buck said. “We need an approach to rent stabilisation and control that works in London. Once we have set out these proposals, we will argue the case that ministers must support London’s private renters by putting our plans into action.”Most major cities in Europe and North America have some limits on rents in the private sector. In Berlin, rents are controlled both within and between tenancies and New York has some apartments capped by the NYC Rent Guidelines Board, while others have their rent “stabilised” or reset between tenancies.In Scotland, new laws have recently been introduced to allow councils to apply to implement “rent pressure zones”, where rent increases are capped at no higher than inflation.Hannah Slater, policy manager at the campaign group Generation Rent, said Londoners would welcome any possible changes. “Londoners are paying some of the highest rents in the world and many are struggling to keep a roof over their head in the area they grew up in or close enough to where they work,” she said.Khan will face a Conservative challenge from Shaun Bailey, who has been a critic of Khan’s housebuilding record because of numerous delayed housing schemes in the capital, though Labour has blamed Brexit for the construction slowdown and argued the mayor has overseen the building of more new homes in one year than any of his predecessors.Brokenshire’s spokesman said Khan was not using his existing powers to build more houses. “People who want a more affordable and secure private rental market thankfully don’t need the mayor’s help because they can trust the Conservatives in government to watch their backs.” Labour’s 2017 manifesto included a pledge to “introduce controls on rent rises” and to consider giving the mayor of London additional powers, given the particular pressures in the capital. Previously the party had promised legislation decreeing that landlords would only be able to raise rents for tenants by less than inflation for the duration of a contract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

He delivered another last night and you can read it here (pdf). I haven’t read it myself yet (they are never short), but I’m told it is as good as all the others.The ’s Peter Foster has posted some highlights in a Twitter thread, starting here.This is from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague. The Yvette Cooper bill intended to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal would oblige the PM to seek an extension of article 50 until the ned of 2019 in the event of no deal being agreed by 26 February. McTague suggests that this nine-month extension could turn into a three-month extension as the price for Labour supporting the bill. The European Commission has adopted two legislative proposals to soften the impact on the EU fishing industry if there is a no-deal Brexit, the Press Association reports. The proposals provide for compensation to fishermen and operators in the case of a sudden closure of UK waters to EU boats. And they prepare the way for the EU to offer UK boats access to its waters until the end of 2019 on condition that Britain grants access to its waters for EU boats in return.And this is from the Financial Times’ Alex Barker.Back in the Lords committee, Barclay is saying more about the legislation that would have to be passed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.On the issue of whether there is enough time, Barclay says “risk appetite” would be a factor taken into account. The business managers would have to take a decision.At PMQs Theresa May firmed up her opposition to allowing Scotland to hold a second independence referendum. (To hold a proper, legally valid referendum, Edinburgh needs permission from London.) When Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, called in 2017 for a second independence referendum, May brushed this aside with the response: “Now is not the time.”This afternoon, in response to a question from the Scottish Conservative Stephen Kerr, May seemed to rule one out for good. She told MPs:The last thing we want is a second independence referendum. The United Kingdom should be pulling together, and should not be being driven apart.Sturgeon has responded firmly. In a statement issued ahead of her meeting with May at Number 10 this afternoon, she said:Theresa May fears she would lose an independence referendum and is clearly running scared of the verdict of the Scottish people - who must be sick and tired of being told what the prime minister wantsFrankly, what Scotland needs is much more important than what the prime minister wants. On a daily basis, Brexit is illustrating this fundamental point - Scotland needs the power to take our own decisions. That’s the only way to stop Tory ideologues driving us to disaster and Westminster governments imposing polices we didn’t vote for.The mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their future is cast-iron. A majority of MSPs and Scottish MPs returned at the last two general elections support holding an independence referendum in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves.This is a far stronger statement of intent than even the comments that Sturgeon made in advance of her trip to London, when she said that “we have the right to consider other options for our future, including independence.”It’s worth remembering that Sturgeon must balance not only the demands of this Brexit endgame but also calls within her own party for a clearer signal about her referendum plans.The SNP MP and prominent People’s Vote supporter Joanna Cherry has been tweeting today about the possibility of holding a second independence referendum during the transition period.In contrast to Cherry, yesterday the long-serving SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil called on Sturgeon to drop support for a second EU referendum and instead put the case for a fresh vote on Scottish independence to the “fore”, as did Alex Neil, the former SNP health secretary and Brexiteer, last week.Also this week, former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill yesterday called for Sturgeon’s husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, to “move on” from his position in order to avoid the impression that he was shielding his wife from criticism over her handling of the Alex Salmond sexual harassment investigation. Some paint these critics as elder statesman figures speaking for others who are reluctant to voice their concerns about party strategy in public because of their own, more active positions others point out that these older, white, male voices represent a particular constituency within the party but do not reach beyond that. Nor is it clear what influence, if any, these voices have on Sturgeon’s thinking.Meanwhile, activists within the SNP and across the wider yes movement are split, with some demanding that Sturgeon use her mandate immediately and others urging caution, particularly given the lack of dramatic movement in the polls. Will the waiting be over soon? Sturgeon finally pledged last week to set out her plans for a second independence referendum “in the coming weeks” even if article 50 is extended.Back in the Lords EU committee Barclay claims that some of the opposition to Theresa May’s deal can be “overplayed”. He says the fact that the government was likely to lose meant some opposition MPs, who in other circumstances might have backed the government, decided not to.Turning away from the committee hearing for a moment, this, from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, is interesting ...Hilary Armstrong, a former Labour chief whip, is asking the questions now.Q: What does the PM mean when she says she will change the way she engages with parliament? And when will the government decide it is too late to get a deal?Barclay says the government does not like the way MPs have been using “humble addresses” to get private government papers. So the government has been thinking about how else it can brief MPs. He mentions confidential briefings, and briefings for select committees as option. He suggests committees work more effectively than the Commons chamber.On timing, Barclay says the government wants a decision “as soon as possible”.Barclay says the government is not running down the clock.

And while scientists have made good progress in the field, the equipment used so far has been highly specialised and expensive.In the latest feat, Goyal and his team used a standard digital camera and a mid-range laptop. “We didn’t use any sophisticated hardware. This is just an ordinary camera and we are all carrying these around in our pockets,” he said.The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, describe how they pieced together hidden scenes by pointing the digital camera at the vague shadows they cast on a nearby wall. If the wall had been a mirror the task would have been easy, but a matt wall scatters light in all directions, so the reflected image is nothing but a blur. Goyal said: “In essence, computation can turn a matt wall into a mirror.”They found that when an object blocked part of the hidden scene, their algorithms could use the combination of light and shade at different points on the wall to reconstruct what lay round the corner. In tests, the program pieced together hidden images of video game characters – including details such as their eyes and mouths – along with coloured strips and the letters “BU”.Given the relative simplicity of the program and equipment, Goyal believes it could be possible for humans to learn the same trick. In a draft blog written for Nature, he said: “It is even conceivable for humans to be able to learn to see around corners with their own eyes it does not require anything superhuman.”At the moment, the program takes about 48 seconds to work out a hidden scene from a digital image, but Goyal believes it could be done much faster with more computer power. Eventually, it may be fast enough to run on video footage.In an accompanying article, Martin Laurenzis, an imaging expert at the French–German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, explains that with multiple images to draw on, the technique could track the movement of hidden targets.But it could also have much broader uses, he said, in microscopy, medical imaging and monitoring in hazardous environments such as chemical plants or nuclear power stations. Laurenzis said: “The technique could be used by vehicles to avoid collisions, and by firefighters and first responders to look into burning or collapsed structures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abba3cdd588f54f32eda3dcd7151a99db4c98bda/0_0_4062_2436/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ce88bbe6a60f80e5113d2f88f3e703","title":"scientists rewrite mice dna so genes can be spread through species","story":"Controversial procedure has huge potential to combat diseases such as malariaA controversial procedure that can spread particular genes through an entire wild species has been demonstrated in mammals for the first time.Researchers in the US showed that a “gene drive” could rewrite the genetic makeup of mice so that the rodents carried DNA that had been designed by the scientists.Gene drives work by breaking the normal rules of inheritance to ensure certain genes, often modified versions, are passed on from one generation to another at a higher rate than normal.The procedure has drawn huge interest from researchers because of its potential to combat diseases such as malaria by rewriting the genetic makeup of mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite.Experimental gene drives have already been used to make disease-carrying mosquitoes infertile. If these insects were released into the wild, it is likely mosquito populations would crash. Other gene drives have boosted the insects’ resistance to infection by the parasites.Many scientists suspect that the same approach might prove a more effective alternative to the laborious and costly eradication projects used to clear remote islands of invasive species. Last year, the world’s largest eradication effort finally declared South Georgia free of the mice and rats that had devastated its wildlife for more than 250 years.But, for all their potential, many researchers are cautious about gene drives because those that go awry could cause substantial damage to ecosystems. In 2016, the US National Academies of Science ruled that far more work was needed to understand and control gene drives before they can safely be used in the wild.Kimberly Cooper, a biologist at the University of California in San Diego, wanted to create a gene drive in mice – not to eradicate rodents on far-flung islands, but to make animals with the kinds of mutations that underlie human diseases. This could help scientists better understand some of the most common afflictions.Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers describe how, after a number of failed attempts, they found a way to genetically engineer mouse embryos so the females spread a modified gene through future generations faster than the normal rules of inheritance allow. The procedure did not work in males, but instead created mutations in the animals.“Our findings suggest that doing this in mice is more complicated than it was in insects and that does raise questions about whether this will ever be as efficient as you’d need for wild release,” Cooper said. One concern is that the mutations left in the males made them resistant to the gene drive, which could scupper its use to eradicate invasive rodents.Cooper still sees a use for the gene drive in the lab. It could be used to create animals which carry multiple genetic faults linked to human diseases such as cancer, diabetes and arthritis, she said. “The hope is you could make all of these changes inidually and understand each of them and then breed them all together.”Christophe Boëte at the University of Montpellier said that while the work was a proof-of-principle for a gene drive in mammals, it suggested that using the approach to control invasive species was a distant prospect.“Their results highlight that such a tool for population eradication in the wild is far from being available. The low efficacy means that it would take many generations and favours selection for resistance against the drive,” he said. “This of course is only the tiny technological part of the issues. They are many other ethical, regulatory and ecological aspects to considered with the utmost importance before embarking further on such an approach in conservation biology.”Cooper said it was crucial for researchers who work on gene drives to be responsible and to discuss their work with broader society.“There will always be people who are not happy because there are people who think the work should just not be done. I don’t know that that’s really practical,” she said. “But it is tricky, because who gets a voice? If everyone has a voice then nothing gets done. The people I know who are working in this area are very cautious scientists and it’s important to say that this is an incredibly powerful technology for good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

Even Ireland’s usually understated head coach, Joe Schmidt, is warning his players to brace themselves for a “brutal” first-round collision with England, with the visitors intent on easing the hurt of their fifth-placed finish last season.With Wales and Italy heading for Paris and Edinburgh in no mood to be pushed around, this year’s competition launch in south‑west London almost had the feel of a pre‑fight weigh‑in featuring six knuckle‑cracking boxers. As Schmidt put it when invited to describe the threat posed by Eddie Jones’s side: “He said he was going to bring some brutality and he has some players who can bring that. They are going to be physical and we need to be primed for it.”Among the reasons for the heightened anticipation is that 24 years have passed since England last visited Dublin on the opening weekend. This is also the first time in Six Nations history they have had to tackle an Irish side placed second in the world rankings. With the squads based just a few miles apart in the Algarve this week, the rival Portuguese men o’war both know a slow start will spell big trouble.Jones, having joked about “buying a pair of binoculars” at the airport for spying purposes, clearly believes a softly, softly approach will get England nowhere. “I’ve never seen a Six Nations game that was not brutal,” he said, in no doubt where this season’s title will be won and lost. “Traditionally, if you look at Six Nations history over the years, it’s a big gainline contest. Ball-in-play time is also higher in the Six Nations than any other tournament in the world. You’ve got to be prepared for it and we’ll be prepared, I’m sure Ireland are not over in Portugal sunbathing. They’ll be preparing for a tough old contest.”Ireland’s captain, Rory Best, does not disagree, confirming his side are anticipating a “monster” test against opponents who could easily throw a major ner in the works. “If you don’t perform well, England have the firepower to beat you well. But that fear’s a good thing … it drives you on.”Mixed in with all the big bang theory is the small matter of the looming Rugby World Cup, which means all involved will have to box clever. With Ireland and Scotland occupying the same World Cup pool, their round‑two meeting at Murrayfield has extra resonance and Wales’s Warren Gatland has suggested his team may keep some of their Japanese cards hidden during the Six Nations. He also believes, even so, that victory in Paris on the tournament’s opening Friday night will set Wales on the road to winning the title for the first time since 2013.Italy, whose captain and totem Sergio Parisse is poised to beat Brian O’Driscoll’s record for the most Six Nations appearances by any player, are also making bullish noises, arguing their 66-3 autumn defeat by New Zealand in Rome does not reflect the progress Italian rugby has made at both Test and provincial level over the past 12 months. With two Scottish representatives in the last eight of the European Champions’ Cup and France also showing signs of perking up, the tournament – now backed by Guinness, the third different title sponsor in as many years – has rarely been more eagerly awaited.Even Jones, who has been around umpteen blocks in both hemispheres, sounds more excited than at any stage in his England tenure. “There’s a sign outside saying it’s the greatest tournament in the world. Four years ago I wouldn’t have said that but having been involved in it there’s nothing like this tournament. The intensity, the contest, how much it means to people, it’s a real honour to be involved in it.”As for the looming Irish challenge, he is well aware England will need to be on top form to win in Dublin for the first time since 2013. “There are two contests against Ireland, one in the air and one on the ground and you have to win both of those to win the game,” said Jones, confirming that the former England captain Will Carling would once again be offering leadership guidance to players during the coming months. “We’ll pick a side to win those battles.”There is also the associated issue of which coach emerges as the favourite to coach the 2021 Lions in South Africa. Gatland has expressed an interest but Schmidt, for now, is playing down his chances, reiterating that he may well take a break from coaching completely rather than make himself available to coach the Lions or the All Blacks. “I’m an incredibly accidental coach. It’s not that I don’t love the game, it just wasn’t my intended career. I’ve had an unbelievable time in the game, whether it be with Bay of Plenty, with Leinster, and now with Ireland. I think you’ve got to run out of luck at some stage.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b94a3d7dea976c34b6b33f40282d78c2a92dab/0_145_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1665e8c15947ec5474fde45b47963d6","title":"push festival review home manchester","story":"Home, ManchesterCuts of the Cloth explores a family torn apart by the state while storyteller Conor A offers an account of chronic illnessNurturing new performances is a balancing act: shows need audiences to develop, but exposing embryonic work too soon can be fatal. At this year’s Push festival, Home’s annual celebration of creative talent in the north-west of England, five new commissions spearhead the programme. Yet often these premieres feel like works-in-progress. There is a fine line between showcasing this work and protecting it by labelling it as “in development”.One of these commissions, Cuts of the Cloth, captures the dystopian mood of the moment. The speaker of Hafsah Aneela Bashir’s one-woman show is a living exhibit, forced to perform in a museum of the near future. The soothing explanatory voiceover has all the neutral, blandly reassuring tones of the 21st-century museum, but its attractions queasily recall the “human zoos” of slavery-era Europe.This is a show about various kinds of surveillance and othering. Bashir begins the performance standing inside a frame, the height and shape of both a museum cabinet and an airport security metal detector. She’s here to warn us about Islamic extremism, in a disturbing “seminar” aimed levelly at the UK government’s anti-radicalisation Prevent programme. She might be speaking from the future, but the target is the present, from racist stopping-and-searching to overzealous safeguarding.The performance’s presentation suggests a finished show, but its muddled structure needs development. As the protagonist narrates how her family has been torn apart by the state, it’s unclear whether we’re still watching the “seminar” or if that frame has been broken. Bashir is best when eloquently raging against Islamophobia, racism and misogyny, ferociously denouncing the many kinds of violence – from bombs to bureaucracy – perpetrated in the name of freedom and democracy. There’s a lot here, and at the moment it strains to hold together.Learning to Swim on an Ironing Board, by contrast, embraces the provisional and the unfinished. Storyteller Conor A is clear that living with chronic illness is a constant work-in-progress, and so is his solo show about fibromyalgia, therapy and eavesdropping. As Conor explains, chronic illness has a rubbish narrative arc. There’s no conflict, crisis and redemption, just a repeating cycle of pain and getting by. But he does his best to give it a shape and a few punchlines, finding humour and hope in the changes that fibromyalgia has brought to his life.The show is framed by Conor’s eavesdropped gems of wisdom, posted on his Overheard in the Arndale social media pages. (Sample: “You can tell a lot about a doctor by the way they put on a rubber glove.”) The earwigging started as a strange form of therapy as Conor tried to unpick the challenges of living with an invisible disability, and it offers a gentle way into what could be tricky subject matter. The performance that follows meanders between Conor’s illness, his therapy sessions and the strange, funny and glorious things people say in a shopping centre.It’s messy, but charmingly so. Accessibility – for both Conor and his audience – is embedded in the piece. There’s a chat at the start to explain how things will work, and Conor takes necessary breaks from performance during video sections. But rather than these adaptations feeling like distractions, they’re integral to a show that is about accepting and making the most of the hand you’ve been dealt. Or as Conor puts it, getting better at not getting better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e5f29f7393838b74cec3e33c0d2058b8eb7aae/0_0_4572_3162/master/4572.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90c164ab451438e29f8f9504125c3e52","title":"the slumflowers guide to peckham londons coolest neighbourhood","story":"We spoke to blogger and author Chidera Eggerue (AKA the Slumflower) as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series – where innately curious people reveal the ‘ordinary’ places and things that inspire them.

But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs.

I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions.

I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we’re taking a look at a new cohort of influencers determined to use their devices for more than just selfies. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyThey’re often the first thing we look at when we wake up, the last thing we see before we go to bed, and most of us couldn’t go a few hours without thinking about them. No, not our loved ones, but our phones. According to data from Ofcom, people in the UK now check their smartphones – averaged out of a waking day – every 12 minutes. But instead of seeing that as bad, throwing our devices in the sea and going to live in a cave, a new movement suggests that it’s time to re-evaluate our relationship with social media. Instead of seeing it as a time-sucking temptation that turns us into head-down zombies, used in the right way our smartphones might actually be our best tool for enabling memorable real-world moments and making every day more extraordinary.Ironically, it’s social media influencers who are leading the charge for sustainable use of the medium and the beauty of sharing more meaningful content, even if that means sharing less. Author and broadcaster Emma Gannon is the author of Ctrl Alt Delete, which examines the millennial phenomenon of growing up online and balancing the demands of being an influencer with having a private life.“I started to use social media when I was 11 or 12,” she says. “People say the dopamine rush from social media is like having a hug, so we shouldn’t feel bad when someone retweets us 100 times because that feels amazing. But I think it can be a dangerous cycle if that’s the only way to feel good.“I think the more someone is sharing, the more they need validation. As I grow up, I share less because I feel more confident. I don’t need everyone to know what I’m doing all the time because I just feel happy doing it.”Just as the idea of slow living is gaining popularity, so too is slow social media. Fashion journalist Pandora Sykes describes herself as an “accidental influencer” and recently wrote a blog post about conscious sharing. “Call it selfish (I prefer self-protection), but I’ve recently drawn some parameters in the sand,” she writes.Someone who knows only too well the importance of balancing mental health and social media is Katherine Ormerod. With 49.5k followers and a steady income from Instagram posts, her life online looks like an endless stream of sunset selfies and glamorous parties. “I spent years putting on a great show that my life was pretty perfect, and it was exhausting. Then my husband left me when I was 29 and I couldn’t fake it any more,” she says.In her book Why Social Media Is Ruining Your Life, she speaks to influencers who reveal what their lives are really like away from the glossy hair and chia seed smoothies. “At times, I’ve legitimately loved taking pictures, felt creatively challenged and fulfilled, genuinely happy that I’ve finally found somewhere to express myself,” she says. “But I’ve also dealt with the full gamut of emotion that social media can generate. It’s made me want to buy things I can’t afford, made me feel like I’m lazy in comparison to other people and, at times, made me feel very low. It’s also made me feel overweight, unattractive, poor, unstylish, lonely, left out, unpopular and seriously devoid of a sense of humour.”But by realigning our thoughts about our online lives, Ormerod says it is possible to find your digital happy place. “Social media is here to stay, as are our phones, and while ‘off-gridding’ for a certain amount of time is gaining popularity, for most of us it’s really a matter of conscious, mindful consumption,” she says.“We can carve out a new path for a healthy and beneficial relationship, one where we are in the driving seat, controlling our intake and uptake of these digital platforms so they work for us. Instead of wasting any more time ‘comparing despairing’ or zooming in on our saggy knees.”Similarly, Catherine Price, author of How to Break Up With Your Phone, spent 18 months researching mindfulness and neuroplasticity to develop a comprehensive strategy for how to consciously uncouple with her device from time to time. “I still wanted to use social media, but I wanted a new relationship with it – one with better boundaries, and over which I had more control,” she says. “The goal wasn’t to never use my phone again it was to create a sustainable relationship that felt healthy.”Ormerod agrees and says that it’s not just about unfollowing people who make you feel insecure, it’s about seeking out those who educate and illuminate – the people who inspire you to see the everyday world in a different way. “Find content that is going to inspire you and you’re going to have a far, far better experience.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e75ace068a76be2c12679dc5bce942d8956c7c1/697_556_698_419/master/698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e585baefee96e764e01762b4c080e734","title":"power mentors the community activists inspiring young londoners","story":"Anyone’s surroundings can inspire them to change their life – you just have to be willing to see the world with fresh eyes. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected. The British reserve gave way for silence on crowded carriages that would usher, for me, creativity.” Anyone’s surroundings can turn into sites for new potential – you just have to be willing to see your world with fresh eyes.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cce673e30312e296798c9e41d674ad77a827339/372_146_2367_1420/master/2367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=158919e6ed16a60abfe32c2fab7ff0cb","title":"how elon musks secretive foundation benefits his own family","story":"Some of the Musk Foundation’s grants have benefited AI research, his brother’s charity, his children’s school and his fight against LA trafficThe entire website of Elon Musk’s private charitable foundation is shorter than many of the Tesla CEO’s contentious tweets. “Musk Foundation. Grants are made in support of: Renewable energy research and advocacy Human space exploration research and advocacy Pediatric research Science and engineering education,” the site reads.Documents obtained by the  reveal how the foundation has put that vague mission statement into practice. Together, the documents show that many of the organization’s donations have gone far beyond its stated scope. Some have benefited the billionaire’s own family and initiatives, others have tackled his pet peeves – the foundation has given more money to artificial intelligence research than to any of the more traditional charities it says it supports.As with many other of his achievements, Musk has publicly touted his charitable activities, whether during the Flint water crisis or amid international efforts to rescue a young soccer team trapped in a Thai cave. Musk has given personally to multiple causes and organizations, including multimillion-dollar donations to the Sierra Club and the XPrize Foundation, and a $1m grant to the Obama Foundation. But the bulk of his charitable giving has been through this private foundation, for which he provides the entirety of its funding.The Musk Foundation has disbursed more than $54m in 15 years of operations, more than a third in direct gifts to 160 charities, according to an analysis of filings with the Internal Revenue Services from its incorporation in 2001 to the middle of 2017. Most recorded awards totalled just a few thousand dollars, and many went to environmental, educational, medical and space advocacy organizations.Others, however, landed closer to home. Recipients have included a school attended by Musk’s own children, a charity managed by his brother, a protest group fighting gridlock on Musk’s commute to SpaceX, and even an art project at Musk’s favorite festival, Burning Man.In 2012, Musk joined billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and Warren Buffett in signing The Giving Pledge, a commitment by some of the world’s richest iniduals to give away the majority of their wealth, either during their lifetimes or upon their deaths. Musk – who controls Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company – is worth an estimated $22bn, although almost all his wealth is tied up in his own companies.Musk had started organizing his charity givings more than a decade earlier.Musk launched his foundation in 2001, together with his younger brother Kimbal, who would serve as the organization’s secretary and treasurer. Musk’s first big gift to the foundation came the following year, shortly after eBay bought PayPal, the payments company that Musk had an interest in. Musk gave his organization 30,000 eBay shares, worth $2.1m.In those early days, the foundation made small, uncontroversial donations to Musk’s alma maters in South Africa and the US, to other educational charities, space societies and children’s hospitals such as the Seattle Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.Between 2007 and 2014, Musk topped up the foundation’s coffers with a little over $3.1m in cash. The list of its recipients grew longer – and began to feature more organizations with links to Musk’s own family and interests.The foundation funded photovoltaic systems helping communities affected by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 and the Fukushima earthquake in 2011. Musk’s solar power company Solar City (now part of Tesla) participated in both installations.Also in 2010, the foundation spent $183,000 to help launch Kitchen Community, a Colorado-based charity headed by Kimbal that used “learning gardens” in underserved areas to help children grow and prepare fresh food. Kitchen Community, now called Big Green, would receive a total of nearly half a million dollars over the next four years – one of the foundation’s largest direct awards. As executive director and chairman of the project, Kimbal received nearly $85,000 in payments by Big Green between 2010 and 2016.Between 2011 and 2013, the foundation also made two $50,000 donations to the Mirman school for gifted children in Los Angeles, a school that Elon Musk’s sons were attending at the time. Musk later started his own not-for-profit school, Ad Astra, located within SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, which his children now attend.In 2012, the year Musk signed the giving pledge, the foundation expanded its horizons and donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, and a not-for-profit organization for professional women in New York’s film, television and digital media industries.It also made three $25,000 payments to a tiny pressure group called Angelenos Against Gridlock. The group was lobbying for improvements to the notoriously congested Interstate 405 highway that Musk uses regularly to commute from his Bel-Air home to SpaceX. Angelenos Against Gridlock is now defunct, and Musk has turned his attention to building tunnels to whisk Tesla electric cars swiftly beneath the city’s traffic instead.The high point of 2012 was possibly a $10,000 donation to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), a non-profit that is developing medical therapies using marijuana and MDMA. That donation helped fund the Temple of Whollyness, a large wooden art structure that went up in smoke at the climax of 2013’s Burning Man festival in Nevada.By mid 2015, the Musk Foundation was down to its last $60,000. The following May, Musk donated 1.2m shares of Tesla Motors, valued at nearly $255m at the time.Musk has long worried about the possibilities of superhuman, malevolent artificial intelligence, likening it to “summoning the demon”. In 2015, he had pledged $1bn to a set up a research company called OpenAI that would develop safer AI in a “way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole”.“Elon’s charitable giving has kickstarted AI safety research, transforming it into what is now a vibrant and respectable research area,” said Max Tegmark, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who personally received $9m from Musk for research at the Future of Life Institute.But in 2016, the IRS was still processing OpenAI’s non-profit status, making it impossible for the organization to receive charitable donations. Instead, the Musk Foundation gave $10m to another young charity, YC.org. The charity lacks a website or social media presence but its stated aim is “making grants to other 501(c)3 initiatives and activities that are trying to solve the world’s problems”.Filings show the organization is run by Sam Altman, a director of OpenAI and the president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley accelerator that has helped to launch hundreds of technology startups, including Airbnb, Cruise Automation and Dropbox. Altman is also a director of OpenAI.The Musk Foundation’s grant accounted for the majority of YC.org’s revenue, and almost all of its own funding, when it passed along $10m to OpenAI later that year. Open AI’s tax filings show its top researcher alone was paid $1.9m in 2016. Though that’s not out of line with what some top AI researchers make, it’s more than the Musk Foundation handed out to all other charitable causes during its first eight years of operation.Also in 2016, the Musk Foundation made its largest disbursement to date, giving $37.8m to Vanguard Charitable. It’s a donor-advised fund – a tax-efficient giving vehicle that holds money on behalf of multiple clients and distributes it over time. This type of structure makes it difficult for the public to tell which client is making which awards, a benefit for the publicity-shy.While secrecy was not Musk’s motivation for using donor-advised funds, he does believe that true philanthropy is done for the most part anonymously, a spokesperson for the foundation told the .There are some hints that the foundation could be returning to grassroots giving. Last summer, Musk tweeted that he would help address the public health crisis in Flint, Michigan. The foundation said that it has donated more than $1m worth of water filtration equipment and laptops to causes in the city. But, if Musk continues to use Vanguard, it would make his already secretive foundation even less transparent in future years.Neither Elon nor Kimbal has ever accepted any compensation for their work with the foundation, nor are there any other salaried staff at the organization, filings indicate.None of Musk’s charitable decisions are particularly uncommon for a billionaire’s private foundation, said Harvey Dale, director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at New York University. Many wealthy iniduals fund their children’s schools, and support their own charities and initiatives, he explained.Even the foundation giving money to Big Green, which in turn paid Kimbal, may not be problematic. Big Green did not respond to requests for comment, but the Musk Foundation noted that Elon Musk has no involvement in Big Green and was unaware of any payments to Kimbal. It also said that those payments have now stopped.On Wednesday, the foundation added aline to its website, stating its support for the “development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5413416b1692a71d53a43168ffa1cabb9ce2c7c0/0_13_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2973f1038349b7c6c917c5526164079c","title":"2019 hoscars winners worlds best hostels solo independent travel","story":"Prague hostel wins trio of titles in annual hostel awards, which has introduced new solo travel categories to reflect rise in independent travellersSolo travellers praised the Roadhouse’s large shared spaces, group walking tours, organised trips to local festivals and home-from home touches, including Netflix and nightly “family dinners”.

I remember many things from that time: the rich smell of her cooking the endless TV she would consume, from 60s Bollywood movies to Neighbours the thickness of her reading glasses. But above all, I recall the constant crackle of an AM signal tuning in to Sunrise Radio.For my grandma, Sunrise was a connection to the India she had left 30 years before. People she knew would ring in to debate current affairs or gossip the high-pitched voices of singers Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar would ring out. Prayers would be played on festive occasions. To me, this was all just noise. I wanted Kiss FM or Choice. I found Asian music embarrassing and shrill, and the talk shows made no sense. But to the over three million British Asians living in the UK, independent radio stations such as Sunrise in London, Asian Sound in Manchester and Sabras in Leicester were a way of connecting to their fragmented communities.This month, Sunrise celebrates its 30th anniversary. It is now a nationwide service and the world’s first commercial 24-hour Asian radio station. It is a clear example of how Asian music and its broadcasting platforms have flourished in Britain to cater to its demographic, despite changing tastes. Even the establishment has taken note, with the BBC’s Asian Network reaching its 17th year of broadcasting, having recovered from the threat of closure in 2010.Starting life as a pirate station in the early 1980s in Southall, Sunrise expanded from west London to the West Midlands and Yorkshire after receiving its license in 1989. Jay Sean, one of the first British Asian artists to have mainstream success after support from Asian radio, says Sunrise was a staple for him and his peers. “Growing up in Southall in the 90s, everyone was listening, especially my parents,” he says. “Their jingle is still stuck in my head.”Ravi Sharma, one of Sunrise’s first presenters, says radio that spoke to British Asians on its own terms was rebellious. “People who have stayed rooted to their culture in this country are swimming against the tide,” he says. “They are expected to integrate into Western culture and leave their heritage behind, so for Sunrise to provide access to these roots is of paramount importance.”Yet this rootedness in the immigrant experience also made young people shy away from stations like Sunrise. Former Radio 1 DJ and current Asian Network presenter Bobby Friction says he saw the station as something for the older generation. “My issue was that it mainly served my parents’ tastes,” he says. British Asian jazz musician Arun Ghosh puts it down to political context. “For British Asians in the 80s and 90s, you had to negotiate a lot of racism,” he says. “So at the time I didn’t admit to liking any Asian music, out of fear or shame.”As the millennium arrived, listenerships were dwindling. Sunrise went from 399,000 listeners in 1999 to stagnate at 332,000 by 2006. Competing for a share of this already-reduced audience, the BBC combined its local Asian radio programming in Leicester and Birmingham and launched the national Asian Network in 2002. “It was a watershed moment – the first time there was a UK-wide focus on the Asian audience. We were being recognised and legitimised,” says current Asian Network controller Mark Strippel.Composer Nitin Sawhney thinks the launch of Asian Network “was an excuse not to have Asian DJs on mainstream radio. Before that, there was a real influx of Asians into the mainstream,” he says. “Talvin Singh got nominated for a Mercury prize and won it. I got nominated, and Asian Dub Foundation and Cornershop were signed to major labels. In the years after, it felt like a segregation took place. Asian Network became a box to put everything in and as a result, there wasn’t an encouragement of new Asian music.”Strippel says Asian Network is shifting focus to 15-34 year olds. “Our programming is now in English,” he says, “and it connects to young British Asians who might be proud of their heritage but who also won’t be fluent in Punjabi and who listen to bhangra mixed with hip-hop and grime. That’s the new generation’s perspective and that’s what they want to hear.”Asian Network is also recruiting younger presenters, such as breakfast host Harpz Kaur and drivetime’s Yasser, who combine Asian music with debate on everything from cultural appropriation to body positivity. The strategy seems to be paying off, with over 600,000 people tuning in every week.Sunrise has followed suit, producing ratings second only to Asian Network. “We needed the latest talent and that’s what I had to bring in,” says Tony Lit, Sunrise’s managing director. “I sincerely believe the younger generation still want to be in tune with their culture. They might go through their teenage years where they distance themselves, but when they go to college or university, they develop pride in their community and culture.”Where Sunrise and Asian Network erge, though, is on the topic of musical integration. Asian Network is incorporating the left-field sounds of residents such as Nabihah Iqbal and DJ Manara’s mix of contemporary Bollywood with dancefloor electronics, prompting Strippel to compare the future of British Asian music to the ascension of grime. “Where black British music took off around five years ago, we’re going to see a blooming of British Asian talent now,” he says, “and Asian Network will be at the forefront.”Bobby Friction, who was one of the first Asian presenters on national radio, is enthusiastic about the change. “The Asian Network didn’t used to feel like it was the space for the expression of a British Asian identity,” he says, “but today, it is exactly what it should be. It excels in being a British station for anyone from any background.”Sunrise, however, is resolutely sticking to its formula. “I don’t think Asian music would be absorbed into the mainstream, I don’t think it can be,” breakfast presenter Raj Ghai says. “It would be suicide to put it on Radio 1 since it would alienate English listeners.” Lit is more measured, but agrees that “a hybrid service playing both Asian and English music would not work now – people want something they know and trust.”For Ghosh, there needs to be an amalgam: “We’ve got a really specific cultural heritage but we’re also part of a multicultural society. We have to be separate and we have to be together.”Sawhney, meanwhile, has the pithy maxim: “Where there is cross-fertilisation there is relevance, where there is ghettoisation, it is complete fucking bullshit.” He continues that while Asian radio may pigeonhole talent, it is a necessary means to visibility: “Asian radio makes sure people have a perception of Asians being part of an integrated society, so they don’t start talking about Britain being a country of only white people. It’s multicultural and pluralistic.”Multicultural Britain is one built by a generation of immigrants such as my grandma, tax-paying workers whose colonial passports made them as proud to be British as they were to stay rooted to their cultures. My grandma passed away suddenly, aged 89, while I wrote this article, after over 50 years living in England. This year, I’ll be – for once – tuning in to her favourite station, not just for remembrance but to appreciate how something as simple as a song can bring back the memory of home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818fb6162505d314310978bcf7bcc280683b3227/80_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbd828aa5d8afd8ea5c62ba7a5edcf73","title":"controversy students mock native american strikes national chord","story":"Debate around the incident reverberated culturally and politically amplified by an aggressive entry into the argument by TrumpThe spectacle of a crowd of white teens in pro-Trump caps mocking a Native American activist on the National Mall just days before Martin Luther King Jr day was perhaps not needed to demonstrate that America’s social fabric is stretched thin.The explosion of a media controversy around the incident was probably not necessary to drive participants in the ensuing debate into their usual partisan crouches.And the role of an apparent imposter Twitter account in originally pushing video of the confrontation to go viral was not required to underscore how vulnerable the national dialogue still is to social media hijacking, less than two years out from the 2020 elections.But those elements combined help to explain why the showdown on the Mall between Covington Catholic high school students demonstrating against abortion rights and two other groups has struck a national chord, with reverberations in culture and politics amplified by an aggressive entry into the argument by Donald Trump himself.“The students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good – maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!”It was unclear whether Trump intended to echo King, who delivered his “I have a dream” speech at the very site of the clash, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.Trump’s sure intent, however, was to vindicate the racist and mob-like conduct of some students in the affair by pointing out, as Fox News had already done, that early video of the incident did not capture a previous war of insults at the scene between the Covington students and a small group of confrontational African American evangelists called the Black Hebrew Israelites.Opinions erge – along ideological lines, of course – on whether full-length video of the scene casts the students’ conduct in a different light. The video does capture a moment in which a student takes off his shirt and leads his classmates in a chant, which they heartily join, in the style of a football cheer, or a Trump campaign rally.“In this case the facts happened to support the rightwing tribe,” wrote the conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks.On the contrary, wrote Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, watching every available video “doesn’t greatly change the substance of what you see on the video, which is a middle aged Native American activistelder beating a ceremonial drum in the face of what appears to be a bemused and cocky teenager while his classmates surrounding them, mostly wearing Maga caps, jeer and taunt the man with chopping motions.”Maga: Make America Great Again. The northern Kentucky county where Covington Catholic is located voted for Trump by a 26-point margin. It is also in the heart of a region on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center for its proliferation of hate groups, including white supremacist and radical Christian identity groups.After originally censuring the students and vowing consequences, Covington has in recent days deployed media surrogates to defend itself, to argue that the students were not at fault, and their actions on video had been misunderstood.In a strong indicator of the political undertones of the argument taking shape, the school’s public relations firm is closely tied to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader from Kentucky, noted the Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko.In a national television interview broadcast on Wednesday morning, the student at the center of the spectacle, Nicholas Sandmann, repeated a claim he made Sunday, that he was trying to defuse the situation, wearing a smile of silent prayer, not a condescending smirk, as he stood nose-to-nose with Omaha tribe elder Nathan Phillips.The forensic, and remarkably sharp, debate over what the video exactly shows is another typical feature of the national moment. Trump began his presidency by asking people not to believe photographs showing that his inauguration drew a relatively small crowd. More recently, Trump claimed that he had never said that Mexico would pay for a border wall, despite miles of video evidence to the contrary.The loud disagreement between the political camps over whose side the evidence is on seems unlikely to resolve itself soon. But after a presidential election in which the pernicious influence of imposter social media accounts has been widely documented, the question of exactly who is goading the two sides to battle seems worthy of examination.The original viral Covington video was spread by a Twitter account called @2020fight, a new account with tens of thousands of followers that specialized in incendiary but ideologically inconsistent political content and was attributed to a “teacher” from California, despite using the photograph of a blogger from Brazil.Twitter suspended the account on Tuesday. While there are currently no solid indications of who was behind the account, said Clint Watts, a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, the account’s tactics and patterns are reminiscent of the 2016 social media election tampering campaign.“It still shows the power of inauthentic social media manipulation,” said Watts. “It’s iding us. It doesn’t bode well for 2020.”Bernice King, daughter of the civil rights icon, was among the Twitter users to post the viral video.“We are not a post-racial or post-racism nation,” she wrote. “Courageous people, like this Native elder, face overt racism and racist ideologies and systems each and every day. This is ugly, America. Truth, education and corrective action matter.”“America has cowered in the drudgery of racism and bigotry for 400+ years,” she continued.“Colonialism and white supremacy have violently shaped systems, including education, across the globe. What we teach NOW matters. Our children are influenced by the hate OR the love we give. Choices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1d8d440a6fdf26ab22f362870c612e52889a3a3/0_132_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b156b82e094105fafeb9b4bc1333e526","title":"italian deputy pm matteo salvini calls on french voters not to back macron","story":"Matteo Salvini’s comments prior to elections increase tensions between countriesTensions between Italy and France have deepened after the Italian deputy prime minister urged French people not to support Emmanuel Macron in forthcoming elections, provoking a withering response from Paris.Matteo Salvini called on voters to shun the French president’s En Marche party in European parliamentary elections in May, prompting Nathalie Loisseau, France’s European affairs minister, to dismiss his comments as insignificant and insisting they would not trigger a “competition of the stupidest”.“In France they have a bad government and a bad president of the Republic,” Salvini, who also leads the far-right Northern League, wrote on Facebook. “Macron speaks about being welcoming, but then rejects immigrants at the border. The French people deserve better and the European elections of 26 May will provide a good signal.”To stoke the fire further, Luca Morisi, Salvini’s social media strategist, posted a photo of the minister with Marine Le Pen, his French far-right counterpart who was defeated by Macron in the 2017 elections, on his Facebook page alongside the caption: “Matteo + Marine, Macron’s worst nightmare!” Salvini has forged a partnership with Le Pen as part of a nationalist drive to “save the real Europe” in the EU elections.Salvini seized the opportunity to attack Macron after Luigi Di Maio, his coalition partner and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, caused a storm by accusing France of creating poverty in Africa and causing mass migration to Europe. The Italian envoy in France, Teresa Castaldo, was summoned on Monday over what the French foreign ministry described as “hostile” remarks.In response, Loisseau said the insults were “useless” and would have no effect on French policy. She said: “In France, we have an expression that says whatever is excessive is insignificant. When remarks are excessive … they are, therefore, insignificant.” She added she would not be visiting Italy until “the climate calms.”Italy and France enjoyed good relations before the coalition came to power last June. Things got off to a bad start after Macron spoke about “populist leprosy” in a reported dig against the new government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e81fd0ab6535edd1105c92bf096ef77d8e1db2a6/0_171_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8146177bdf55371ded684e23f2b6507","title":"italy evicts more than 500 people refugee centre near rome","story":"Move is first major eviction since rightwing government enacted hardline migration lawMore than 500 people are being ousted from a refugee reception centre in a town close to Rome in the first major eviction since Italy’s rightwing populist government enacted hardline immigration measures into law.Thirty people were evicted from the centre, the second-largest of its kind in Italy and the place where Pope Francis washed residents’ feet as part of his Easter ritual in 2016, in Castelnuovo di Porto on Tuesday. A further 75 were removed on Wednesday, with the remaining 430 to be evicted before the centre’s closure on 31 January.The evictions follow the approval of the “Salvini decree”, named after Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of the far-right League, in late November.Salvini claimed the centre, which has hosted about 8,000 people over the last eight years, was a den for “drug-dealing and crime” and that the same fate would soon befall the 2,000 people living in the sprawling Cara di Mineo reception centre in in Sicily and at similar structures across Italy.He said the closures would save the Italian government €6m (£5.2m) a year, money that would instead be spent “helping Italians”. “I did what any good father would have done,” he said.Riccardo Travaglini, the mayor of Castelnuovo di Porto, told reporters that no notice was given before the evictions. Men, women and children, many enrolled in local schools, were reportedly separated before the majority were taken by bus to undisclosed destinations. Some were housed by local residents, including Travaglini, who took in a woman from Somalia and her child.“In a single day, they managed to destroy years of work,” Traviglini said. “These were people who had managed to become integrated.”Travaglini protested alongside staff working at the centre and local priests, while Rossella Muroni, a politician with the small leftwing party Free and Equal, attempted to block one of the buses. Parliamentarians with the opposition Democratic party were heavily critical of the move.The party’s Roberto Morassut compared the evictions to “deportations to Nazi concentration camps”. “One of the most important structures for immigrant reception was evacuated without adequate warning … it was a real blitz,” he said.Salvini has said those who “have rights” will not be left stranded and will instead be relocated to other “beautiful structures”. “They will have the right to board and lodging,” he said. “But for the rest we will begin the deportation process.”The evictions came as Germany announced it was pulling out of the EU’s Operation Sophia, a naval mission targeting human trafficking in the Mediterranean, due to Italy’s refusal to allow migrants to disembark at its ports.The majority of residents at the Castelnuovo di Porto centre were in the process of applying for asylum. Many had received humanitarian protection, a two-year permit granted to those who are not eligible for refugee status but who for various reasons cannot be sent home. Humanitarian protection status, which enables people to work and is estimated to be held by about 100,000 people, was abolished under Salvini’s bill.“Salvini’s decree will only amplify social problems,” said Valeria Carlini, a spokesperson for the Italian Council for Refugees. “The law is forcing those who already have humanitarian protection into the social margins … instead of having the chance to work, they will end up homeless.”Unions have also protested over the thousands of jobs that will be lost as a result of the refugee centre closures.“The reality is that there more Italians will be jobless,” said Carlini. “Organisations involved in migrant integration are often accused of being in a ‘lucrative business’. It’s not like that at all, Salvini’s decree will bring many organisations to their knees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3d0395b9c862def50a4ccb0e77e41b874790b2a/0_34_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37e42ec4a00c07e0c4df64c4064968aa","title":"venezuela president what happens next maduro guaido","story":"The US and other states rushed to recognise Juan Guaidó but the path to dislodging the country’s leftwing leader is unclearVenezuela’s political crisis was turned on its head on Wednesday as a succession of world powers declared they were recognizing the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the South American country’s rightful interim president.“The citizens of Venezuela have suffered for too long at the hands of the illegitimate Maduro regime,” Donald Trump tweeted as he announced what some believe could prove a game-changing decision.Soon after, Canada, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Paraguay and Costa Rica said they would follow suit – although Mexico’s left-leaning government said there would be no change of policy for now and Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, attacked what he called an imperialist assault on South America’s right to democracy and self-determination.“Brazil will politically and economically support the transition process so that democracy and social peace return to Venezuela,” tweeted Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.A senior US administration official said the move meant “Maduro and his cronies” now needed to understand they had no future and had no choice but to accept “a peaceful transition” and “an exit solution” from the country.But as the dramatic news sunk in, Venezuela specialists said they were unsure what the immediate impact might be – and how Maduro might react.Eric Farnsworth, a former US diplomat and vice-president of the Council of the Americas, said Guaidó’s move – and Trump’s swift recognition – which came on a day of rare mass protests in Venezuela – was “a clear inflection point” that could prove the tipping point for Maduro’s embattled regime.“I don’t think we can automatically assume he is on the way out. But I do think today is the most serious threat he has faced,” said Farnsworth.Yet it was also a moment fraught with danger, both for the regime and the country. “Maduro can’t acquiesce to this shift – he is going to have to react in some way,” Farnsworth predicted.Maduro wasted no time in launching his counter-attack. From the presidential palace’s “people’s balcony” he announced he was breaking diplomatic relations with the US and gave US diplomatic personnel 72 hours to leave the country.Maduro claimed an attempted coup backed by the “gringo empire” was under way and urged supporters – and crucially the armed forces – to resist it “at all costs”.“We are defending the right to the very existence of our Bolivarian Republic,” Maduro said, accusing his foes of trying to steal Venezuela’s oil, gas and gold: “They intend to govern Venezuela from Washington. Do you want a puppet government controlled by Washington?”Beyond breaking ties with the US, many now expect Maduro to order the arrest of Guaidó or other opposition leaders. Farnsworth said Maduro might also “turn sharpshooters on crowds and try to scare everybody back home”.If that happened, the US and the international community would be forced to react. The US official said it had “a host of options” if such a crackdown occurred: “Everything is on the table – all options.”Ratcheting up oil sanctions in an attempt to economically strangle Maduro’s regime would be the most likely step, with the official warning “we haven’t even scratched the surface” with sanctions.But David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said the US in fact had few good options were Maduro to respond with violence or political repression.“The US and other countries have really upped the ante … but it’s not clear that it breaks new ground,” he said.Increased economic sanctions could exacerbate an already severe humanitarian emergency that the UN says has created the biggest migration crisis in recent Latin American history. A military intervention that would potentially lead to massive destruction and great loss of life and could drag the US into a messy and protracted occupation and reconstruction process was also undesirable.Smilde said: “Look at Somalia, look at Afghanistan, look at Iraq: all of those cases were supposed to be short military actions and actually what they do is end up generating enormous costs in terms of loss of life and infrastructure.”The US official said Trump hoped Maduro and those around him would understand they now had no “immediate future” and had to seek a peaceful exit route that would see democracy restored to Venezuela.Farnsworth said he saw turbulence ahead and warned of a possible breakdown of civil authority and “chaos on the ground”.“This is going to be a very important date which portends some very volatile and uncertain days and weeks ahead,” he predicted. “There is no question in my mind about that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scratch cards sold to minors in four out of 10 shops survey reveals","story":"Scratch cards were illegally sold to minors in almost four out of 10 Irish retail outlets, during a survey undertaken to assess compliance.Research conducted across 510 shops, supermarkets and post offices found that underage purchasers were only asked their age or for identification two-thirds (63 per cent) of the time. Overall, 38 per cent of purchase attempts succeeded. In 5 per cent of cases where the age of the purchaser was queried, the €1 scratch card sales still went ahead. So-called “mystery shoppers”, aged between 15 and 17 years, carried out the test on behalf of the National Lottery regulator which oversees the application of laws governing the sale of lottery products. It was undertaken last year by IpsosMRBI and was the first research of its kind in Ireland. Results were published on Wednesday. The findings also showed that mandatory signs advertising “Over 18” sales rules were only displayed in 73 per cent of premises. The National Lottery Act 2013 prohibits the sale of products to anyone under 18 years of age. “The National Lottery is at an important juncture in that it has recently expanded its retail estate and developed a new system of oversight of its retail agents,” the report noted. In response, the National Lottery acknowledged the findings and said it was committed to undertaking further work to prevent its recurrence.“Protection of participants is at the centre of our business,” it said. “We are, and continue to be, committed to operating at all times in a socially responsible way and are conscious of our responsibilities in this regard.”Since the survey was carried out, the company has appointed a retail compliance manager to ensure vendors were in full compliance with the law. It has also introduced branded “age control” advertising in stores.The licence to operate the National Lottery was granted to Premier Lotteries Ireland in 2014. In 2017, it transferred €227 million to support good causes. This rose each year from a baseline of €178 million. According to its 2017 annual report, more than 1.4 million people played National Lottery games on a regular basis that year. This represents more than 40 per cent of adults in Ireland. Ticket sales for 2017 amounted to €800 million, up from €750 million in 2016."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Two fire engines attended fire on private bus near Ashtown roundaboutDiscovery made by police investigating last Saturday\u0026rsquos car bomb explosion\u0026lsquoMystery shoppers\u0026rsquo aged between 15 and 17 carried out test for National Lottery watchdogMichael Healy-Rae tells D\u0026aacuteil of case of harassment being taken by tenants \u0026lsquowhich consists of them being asked to pay the rent\u0026rsquoMinister for Justice says Minister for Transport has his \u0026lsquoboot on his neck\u0026rsquo over BillMartin, McDonald wore green for Leaders\u0026rsquo Questions but Leo put on his smartest suit for DavosGraham Doyle says nine-month plan primed to come into place if talks EU-UK talks end without dealStudy turns upside down belief that hole formation could only happen in regions bombarded by powerful radiationFormer minister says imposing a geographical rule for selection \u0026lsquois a denial of the most basic element of representative democracyEnvironmental group seeking to quash national mitigation plan published in 2017Proposal to make it an offence to import or sell goods from territory deemed illegally occupiedDublin would have to enforce EU\u0026rsquos customs code, MPs toldSean Ross Abbey was run by the Sacred Heart Sisters from 1930 to 1970Talks at Workplace Relations Commission in bid to avert strike adjourn until ThursdayChristine Rossiter (37) has taken case against doctor alleging negligence in her treatmentFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader claims Harris offered rechecks against expert advicePatrick Quirke (50) goes on trial for murder of DJ who started relationship with woman he had affair with"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3768455.1548278106!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord silence is the golden rule for brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald:  she said the National Children’s Hospital was “at best a fiasco at worst an example of gross incompetence” The Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance were out through the gap and Davos bound by lunchtime, probably breathing a sigh of relief that they managed to escape Leinster House without a single mention of Brexit to disrupt their pre-flight composure.Even though Leo Varadkar laid the groundwork for the Opposition’s vow of silence by updating party leaders on the current position the night before, the temptation to force the Taoiseach to admit in the Dáil that the Brexcrement will hit the fan in the event of a no-deal crashout must have been tantalising for Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald.Particularly when the political day began with a Brexcrutiating interview on Morning Ireland between the Minister for Agriculture and broadcaster Audrey Carville.She went after Michael Creed like a hungry Jack Russell with a grudge, chasing one simple question and then clamping her jaws on his ankle in the hope of getting an answer.Carville asked Creed a dozen times if a no-deal Brexit means a hard border in Ireland.Of course it does. But in Government Buildings the answer is a very firm: “That is not for us to say.” And they aren’t saying it, no matter who applies the thumbscrews.Hence the previous evening’s meeting with the party leaders to get them on messageThe Minister for Agriculture may be the quiet man of Varadkar’s administration, but he was first elected to the Dáil for Cork North West 30 years ago, and, barring a brief hiatus when he lost his seat, has been a Fine Gael front bench spokesman in a variety of portfolios since then. He’s been around the political block and is a canny operator.Creed ducked and ed, squirmed, sidestepped and shimmied around the hard border question until the time ran out. He knew that the listeners knew that he knew he was avoiding the answer, but kept on going because he was Brextemporising for Ireland, and it had to be done.Why, exactly, is a complication too far for most of us.Perhaps mindful of the public’s puzzlement over why their Government is ignoring the inescapable consequence of a no-deal Brexit (nothing to do with us, all down to the UK), Ministers and advisers were quietly talking to political journalists on Wednesday, and explaining why this delicate Brexerise must be adhered to for now.It’s why the green jerseys were fished out for Leaders’ Questions by Martin and McDonald, who gave Brexit a wide berth.The Taoiseach was wearing one of his smartest suits – the grey one – for his impending Davos trip. Paschal Donohoe, getting a lift there with Leo, rambled into the chamber midway through the session, all ready to go. It’s very cold in that part of Europe at this time of year, so he was wearing a sensible V-neck sweater over his shirt and tie.With his neat new Davos haircut, navy suit and navy jumper, the Minister for Finance looked like he’d stepped from the pages of a back-to-school catalogue.As soon as questions were over, Leo skidaddled. Paschal left a short while after.With any luck the pair of them will have missed Bono by the time they got to Switzerland.But before any of that there were plenty of issues to be addressed in the Dáil. Brexit, with its potential to adversely impact on so many different areas of Irish life, is a matter of such concern that it can crowd other issues and ert attention from them.Martin returned to the cervical cancer controversy, and said that the national screening programme was now “in jeopardy” due to an enormous backlog in processing results after women availed of the Minister for Health’s decision to offer free second tests to women at the height of the CervicalCheck scandal last year.Clare Daly of Independents4Change expressed her frustration at the delay in the publication of a final report by Mother and Baby Homes Commission, which has looked for another extension to conclude its work.She said it was given three years to do the job, and four years on it has produced four interim reports: the first, seeking a time extension the second explaining why the first extension was sought the third also looking for an extra year and now “at the eleventh hour” another report looking for another year.“Is this an actual joke?” she asked.While she didn’t expect the Taoiseach to be on top of every detail about the inquiry, she told him it just wasn’t acceptable that he was unable to tell her why the delay is happening.“There is a huge problem in this House. We set up commissions of investigations in response to appalling scandals and horrific abuses perpetuated on our people, and then we let them carry on and we let them ask for extra time...it’s a feature of Irish political life, with the Opposition, with the media, that nobody follows it through.” Once these commissions were set up “everybody forgets”.Daly was followed by the Independent TD for Tipperary Séamus Healy, who spoke up for the 197,000 or so carers in the community who do an immensely valuable and difficult job “with very little financial or other support in return”.However, a significant portion of them are facing waits of up to 17 weeks to have their application for a carer’s allowance approved.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald took up where the Fianna Fáil leader left off on Tuesday, and returned to the incredible story of the ever-expanding budget for the National Children’s Hospital. “At best, a fiasco at worst, an example of gross incompetence.”After repeating for the second day in a row that the new hospital would have the most fantastic facilities, Leo reiterated that people should focus on the “value” of the facility, as opposed to its cost. People may be criticising it now, but like other big projects such as the Luas, the Port Tunnel or Terminal 2 at Dublin airport, people would be always delighted when it was built.Mary Lou, like many others listening to the Taoiseach’s “value” mantra, was happy the new hospital will be world class. Why wouldn’t it be?“I am questioning the efficacy and effectiveness of the procurement procedures.”It is an expensive undertaking, stressed Leo. Where there are overruns of expenditure “there are consequences” and some projects “may well be deferred”.Nothing to worry about, though. It’s just requires a “reprofiling” of the national budget.And as the Taoiseach hopes the hospital will see us through for another 100 years it’ll be cheap at half the price – in the end.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe   Landlords are being “criminalised” by legislation which will give the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) enhanced powers of investigation and of sanction against those who rent out properties, it was claimed in the Dáil.Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae said legislation should be balanced and he acknowledged there were “rogue property owners”.But hitting out at the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No 2) Bill he said the impression was being created that “you’re some sort of criminal if you’re renting out a property”.Mr Healy-Rae who became a landlord for the first time aged 19, said the way things were going no “sane person” would rent property, when they pay half the rent in tax and are then “demonised” for renting.On the second night of debate on the Bill on Wednesday he also hit out at other politicians who were speaking of landlords as if they were “something they stood on outside in the street”. He warned there would be no such thing as a private landlord in the future, but instead there would be “big groups of vulture funds and pension companies who will have hundreds of properties” because it would not be a viable or sensible business for iniduals to be involved in.The legislation to reform the private rental market, allows the RTB to initiate an investigation without a prior complaint. It extends the notice of termination that landlords will have to give tenants to vacate a property and it sets out exceptions to rent caps in rent pressure zones where a property has been substantially altered.The legislation also creates an offence for landlords who fail to comply with rent pressure zone rules or who fail to notify the RTB of rent increases in these areas and it obliges them to register their property annually with the board.Mr Healy-Rae said a couple who worked in Australia bought a house worth €600,000 in Dublin. The rent was fixed at €2,200 but the couple were paid one month’s rent and deposit but not a penny since.The renters were taking a case of harassment “which consists of them being asked to pay the rent” but “they will probably stay in that house for two years before they have to eventually leave”.He said renters were using the system to rob the owners of properties by going from one property to another.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy who introduced the Bill said he wanted to be sure that in making changes to Irish tenancy law “we do not inadvertently cause an unsustainable exit of landlords from the rental sector, which would only make things worse”. He said that over 1,700 landlords had left the market since 2015.He said too that in the Bill “we have to ensure that we are protecting people who are currently struggling with housing affordability and security issues”. He said the rental sector in Ireland “still needs to develop and mature in order to provide a viable, sustainable and attractive alternative to home ownership, rather than serving as a temporary refuge or a staging post on the route to home ownership”.Mr Murphy noted that a professional landlord sector similar to other European countries was “beginning to build in Ireland” but 86 per cent own only one or two properties. The make-up of Ireland’s landlord sector “with its over-reliance on small and accidental landlords, has to be borne in mind”.He acknowledged that while renting “has been a negative experience for some and has not meant a secure and safe home, for the vast majority renting works”.The Minister said “we need it to continue to work, but work better than it has been working, with greater transparency and accountability for tenant and landlord”. Debate on the Bill continues."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3768416.1548276108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish researchers help solve cosmic riddle on birth of black holes in early universe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tZoom of the inner 30 light-years of the dark matter halo. The rotating gaseous disk breaks apart into three clumps that collapse under their own gravity to form supermassive stars. Photograph: John Wise, Georgia Institute of Technology.The sequence of events leading to the creation of massive black holes in the universe has been discovered by astrophysicists including two researchers from Dublin City University’s Centre for Astrophysics and Relativity (CfAR).Light released from around the first massive black holes in the universe is so intense it is able to reach telescopes on the Earth – a truly vast distance away. Light from the most distant black holes (also known as quasars) has been travelling towards earth for more than 13 billion light years, allowing the astrophysicists to look back in time to the early universe. However, how these monster black holes formed remained elusive until now.Dr John Regan and Prof Turlough Downes of DCU, in collaboration with researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology, Michigan State University, University of California (San Diego), the San Diego Supercomputer Center and IBM, have solved this cosmic riddle. The work is made possible by undertaking sophisticated simulations of galaxy formations using super computers.They have shown that when galaxies assemble extremely rapidly, and sometimes violently, it can lead to the formation of a massive black hole. The rapid assembly of gas means that instead of normal star formation proceeding, embryonic stars become puffed up by hot gas. This leads to the formation of a “supermassive” star which can only survive for a short time before quickly collapsing into a massive black hole. The new study turns upside down the long-accepted belief that massive black hole formation, which occurred in the first billion years of the universe, could only happen in regions bombarded by powerful radiation from nearby galaxies. This shifts that paradigm and opens up a whole new area of research, according to Dr Regan, who is a research fellow at CfAR.Their findings were published in the journal Nature on Wednesday. The research was funded by NASA, the EU and the US National Science Foundation. “At first, when we found these black hole formation sites in the simulation we were stumped,” explained Dr Regan. “At a human level, we were really confused initially. We then realised this is actually a hugh breakthrough on what people have been working on for a very long time.“Previous theories suggested this should only happen when the sites were exposed to high levels of star-formation killing radiation. As we delved deeper we saw that these sites were undergoing a period of extremely rapid growth. That was the key!” The violent and turbulent nature of the rapid assembly, the violent crashing together of the galaxy’s foundations during the galaxy’s birth prevented normal star formation and led to perfect conditions for black hole formation instead, he added. Their next goal was to probe further evolution of these exotic objects. “Where are these black holes today? Can we detect evidence of them in the local universe or with gravitational waves?” “Astronomers observe supermassive black holes that have grown to a billion solar masses in 800 million years,” said Dr John Wise from Georgia Institute of Technology. A solar mass is the mass of our own sun. “Doing that required an intense convergence of mass in that region. You would expect that in regions where galaxies were forming at very early times,” he said.What are known as “Renaissance Simulations” of the early universe, on which this research is based, achieve this by working out “on the fly” where interesting things are happening and focusing a lot of effort there, Prof Downes said. “However, even with this extremely efficient method, this work is so challenging that there is no way to get these unique insights into our universe without the use of some of the world’s largest supercomputers.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3768068.1548260350!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu obliged to check goods at border if no deal says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “When I visited Dungannon in May 2018, I was very struck by my meeting with a group of women . . . Two of them wept because they were so afraid that the Troubles would start again.” Photograph: Getty ImagesThe European Union “will have the obligation” to check goods travelling from Northern Ireland to the Republic in the event of a no-deal Brexit, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnierhas said.Mr Barnier spoke in an interview with Le Monde, the Luxemburger Wort and Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita.Asked what would happen to the backstop if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, Mr Barnier replied, “We will be forced to take unilateral emergency measures, and in this precise case (of Northern Ireland automatically leaving the single market) we will have the obligation to carry out controls on products arriving in the Republic of Ireland.”The backstop is a position of last resort, to protect an open Border in Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an overall exit deal. Thousands of people cross the Border daily and goods and services pass between the two jurisdictions without restriction.Mr Barnier did not say what would happen if the Government refused such border checks.“My team and I have done a lot of work on virtual, decentralised controls, which will be useful in all hypotheses,” he continued, seeming to hint at digital checks by a computer that links licence plate numbers to a customs declaration that is filed in advance online, as envisioned at the port of Calais.“Even in the absence of an agreement, we will do our utmost not to create a hard border in Ireland,” he added.Mr Barnier said that a backstop limited to five years, as proposed by the Polish foreign minister, would not be possible.“It is Brexit that imposes the backstop we are talking about today,” said Mr Barnier. “And it is what the UK chose. We proposed a more simple one (in which only Northern Ireland would remain in the single market), but London refused that solution and proposed its own (under which the entire UK would remain in the customs union).”Mr Barnier said he was open to all proposals, including Irish and Polish, since there are 900,000 Poles living in the UK. “But the question of limiting the backstop in time was discussed twice, in November and December 2018. This backstop is the only one possible, because an assurance is no longer operational when it is limited in time.”Mr Barnier was asked if he could be receptive to British prime minister Theresa May’s request for concessions on the backstop. “This security net is part of the withdrawal treaty,” he replied. “It is a guarantee for the preservation of peace and stability on the island of Ireland, the guarantee that in all hypotheses we will not rebuild a hard border, that we will preserve the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area.”Mr Barnier said his meetings in Northern Ireland made him realise how sensitive the issue is and how fragile the peace.“When I visited Dungannon in May 2018, I was very struck by my meeting with a group of women,” he said. “Two of them wept because they were so afraid that the Troubles would start again.”Mr Barnier said the backstop concerns all of Europe. “Because of the freedom of movement within the European internal market, a product that enters Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK is the same as if it entered Poland or France. We have an obligation to control it. It must conform with the standards of the internal market.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The New York Times were on the ground in Paris with the “Yellow Vests” protesters as they took to the streets for the fourth week in a row. Video: NYT\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters wearing Pikachu hats take part in a Women’s Gilets Jaunes protest in front of the Eiffel Tower on January 20th. Photograph: Ian LangsdonEPAThough it started as a protest over fuel taxes, the still simmering ‘Gilets Jaunes’ revolt in France quickly morphed into anger over income inequality and social injustice.Yet paradoxically, the French government is one of the world’s leading redistributors of wealth and social injustice is less than in other developed countries.Le Point magazine and Le Parisien newspaper have in recent days published in-depth dossiers on the question. They cited studies by the French statistical institute Insee and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which found that income inequality is relatively low in France. And there is less poverty in France than elsewhere in the EU.Economists measure income inequality by the Gini coefficient, where zero would mean complete equality. France’s Gini coefficient of 0.289 compares favourably with inequality in the UK (0.351) and the US (0.391). Contrary to popular perception, inequality is not increasing, but stagnating, in France. And it is dramatically lower than 50 to 100 years ago.Likewise, statistics show that purchasing power too has stagnated, not decreased, over the past decade, except for brief periods in 2012 and 2013. However, Insee admits, the cost of basic necessities has risen, especially for the poorest, which sometimes gives the impression the statistics are lying.Only the wealthiest 43.14 per cent of French households pay income tax, and France has the highest rate of payroll deductions in the world. Yet “make the rich pay” is a constant cry of the ‘Gilets Jaunes’.Insee reported in October that the richest 10 per cent of the French paid 70 per cent of all income tax collected in 2017, or €55 billion out of €78 billion.Before income redistribution, the average income of the 20 per cent of wealthiest households was 8.4 times the average income of the poorest 20 per cent.After redistribution, the richest were only 3.9 times better off than the poorest, Insee reported. Government payments, including housing subsidies and social welfare, accounted for two-thirds of the reduction in inequality, while income tax accounted for the other third.However, the \u0026nbspFrench are less socially mobile and less equal in opportunity than citizens of other developed countries. It takes six generations for the offspring of a poor French family to reach median income, compared to four to five generations in other OECD countries. \u0026nbspIn 2017, France ranked eighth among 28 EU countries, with 14 per cent of the population, or 8.8 million people, living in poverty, according to a chart published by Le Parisien. Ireland ranked 11th, with 15.6 per cent in poverty, while Germany was 15th, with 16.1 per cent, and the UK was 17th, with 17 per cent.The French far right and far left claim that ordinary French people are victims of “ultra liberal” government policies that have led the state to disengage from the economy.In fact, Le Point reports, “The weight of the state has never been greater in the economic life of the country.” Over the past 30 years, public spending has tripled, from the equivalent of €416 billion in 1987 to €1,294 billion in 2017. As a percentage of GDP, government spending has risen from 50 to 57 per cent of GDP, the highest in the OECD and, according to some sources, the highest in the world.Social protection has risen from 24.5 per cent of French GDP in 1959 to 32 per cent – also the highest in the OECD – in 2016. Between 1980 and 2017, the number of civil servants rose from 3.86 million to 5.66 million.When President Emmanuel Macron addressed his compatriots in a letter announcing a national debate earlier this month, he said, “France is not like other countries. The sense of injustice is more intense than elsewhere. The demand for mutual assistance and solidarity is greater.”One can only speculate why a generous welfare state has engendered the most persistent anti-government protests in Europe. The different attitude cited by Macron, coupled with a revolutionary tradition, has something to do with it. Fears that Macron’s reforms would alter the system also played a part. As the 19th century philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville observed, the most dangerous moment for a government is usually when it begins to reform."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3768280.1548280419!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk offers talks with ireland on border issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexiteer Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg: “I think the truth is that everybody wants a deal the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal, the Irish want a deal.” Photograph:  Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesDowning Street is ready to start bilateral talks with Dublin about how to avoid a hard Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, after Michel Barnier said goods crossing from North to South would be subject to checks. Theresa May’s official spokesman said Britain would do everything in its power to avoid a hard Border but that Dublin and Brussels had both spoken about the issue of enforcing the EU’s single market rules.“That’s obviously a matter for the EU’s institutions and I think the Irish government have spoken about the two working together in relation to that. In terms of what we can do, the prime minister has obviously said that we don’t want a hard Border, we will do everything we can to prevent that and we would look to have discussions with the Irish government about steps that we could take,” he said.“We recognise that we’d need to take forward discussions with the Irish government in the event of no deal. As to when that happens, I have no time frame for you but we stand ready to have discussions.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil on Tuesday that if there was a no-deal outcome, the British and Irish governments and the EU “would have to negotiate an agreement on customs and regulations that would mean full alignment so there would be no hard border”.Mr Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said on Wednesday there would have to be checks at the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a day after the European Commission’s chief spokesman said so. The commission spokesman on Wednesday sought to row back on his comments but in an interview with the Luxemburger Wort, Mr Barnier said checks could not be avoided.“There will be checks in case of a no-deal-Brexit. We will do everything possible to enforce them unobtrusively. However, that will not be possible with everything. How should we control animals crossing the border? There will have to be checks. Again, the problem arose from Brexit and we expect the UK to take responsibility,” he said.The EU regards the island of Ireland as a single unit for animal health but in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the United Kingdom would become a “third country” that could follow different health standards. Mrs May’s official spokesman suggested, however, that the Belfast Agreement obliged Dublin and London to facilitate North-South cooperation over agriculture.“The Good FridayBelfast Agreement does spell out certain sets of requirements. You can look at those. We are fully committed to our obligations under that agreement,” he said.Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Wednesday that Ireland’s anxiety about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for the Border pointed to a greater willingness to compromise. He said Mrs May could win parliamentary approval for a deal if her withdrawal agreement with the EU was rewritten and the backstop removed from it.“I think the truth is that everybody wants a deal the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal, the Irish want a deal. And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text, that is what they will have to do. This is realpolitik,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: ReutersVenezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido has declared himself interim president, in a dramatic escalation of efforts to force out President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen the country’s slide into authoritarianism and economic ruin.The move was immediately welcomed by the US, Canadian and a dozen Latin American governments. Mexico said it would continue to recognise Mr Maduro as president.US president Donald Trump said he would use the “full weight” of US economic and diplomatic power to push for the restoration of Venezuela’s democracy.Thousands of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Caracas, as Mr Guaido, the head of the opposition-run national assembly, raised his right hand and said: “I swear to assume all the powers of the presidency to secure an end to the usurpation.”The 35-year-old lawmaker said his surprise move was the only way to rescue Venezuela from “dictatorship” and restore constitutional order.“We know that this will have consequences,” Mr Guaido told the cheering crowd. “To be able to achieve this task and to re-establish the constitution we need the agreement of all Venezuelans,” he shouted.Security forces fired teargas at protesters blocking a highway in Caracas. Mr Maduro said he was breaking diplomatic relations with the US in response, with US diplomats given 72 hours to leave the country.Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with hyperinflation rendering the bolivar currency practically worthless. Shortages in food staples and basic medicines are rampant, and crime is widespread. More than three million Venezuelans have fled, causing consternation across the continent.The country’s opposition has struggled to find a strategy against Mr Maduro, however, and analysts warned that Mr Guaido’s gutsy move was potentially dangerous.“It is absolutely clear that the strategy was decided by both the US government and the Venezuelan opposition, so they share the risk,” said Dimitris Pantoulas, a Caracas-based political analyst and consultant. “The government reaction will come shortly and it remains unclear if the people are ready to defend Guaido with their lives.”Relatively unknown until this month, Mr Guaido stepped into the political limelight earlier this month when he declared himself willing to assume the presidency until new elections are held.In a statement, Mr Trump described the national assembly as the “only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people” and warned Mr Maduro not to resort to violence.“We continue to hold the illegitimate Maduro regime directly responsible for any threats it may pose to the safety of the Venezuelan people,” he said.A dozen Latin American governments – including the right-wing administrations of Brazil and Colombia – quickly backed Mr Guaido, although Mexico said that it would not change its policy on Venezuela “for the time being”.Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said that Mr Maduro’s government was “now fully entrenched as a dictatorship”, and called on him to hand power to the national assembly until new elections were held.“The suffering of Venezuelans will only worsen should he continue to illegitimately cling to power,” she said in a statement.In Washington, a senior administration official warned that “all options are on the table” for US action if the Maduro government responded with the use of force against the opposition, but the official focused on diplomatic steps and economic measures that could be taken against Mr Maduro and his top officials.“If the Maduro regime chooses to respond with violence, if they choose to harm any of the national assembly members, all options are on the table for the United States to respond,” the official said.“The message is very clear. The US remains resolute in its support for the transition to democracy in Venezuela. The US will not allow an inidual, Nicolas Maduro, and his cronies to continue to loot the Venezuela state.”The sudden developments came as tens of thousands joined marches across the country, and followed two nights of violent protests in working-class neighbourhoods of Caracas – once bastions of support for the government – and the apparent foiling of an armed uprising by members of the national guard.Morelia Armini, an elderly saleswoman from Caracas, could barely contain her joy at the day’s developments. “This is a wonderful thing,” she said, after watching to Mr Guaido take the oath. “Like a phoenix, this is the rebirth of Venezuela.”Wednesday also marked the anniversary of the 1958 uprising that overthrew the military dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez – a symbolism that was not lost on Maria de Jesus, a social worker from Caracas who was born on the day of the 1958 rebellion.“I was born in democracy,” she said on her way to the march in Caracas. “I want my freedom this is a dictatorship.”Across town, several hundred supporters held a rival march in support of Mr Maduro. Though it was dwarfed in size by the opposition protest, those in attendance were in a buoyant mood.“We are here to support our president and defend our resources,” said Ana Media, who works for the state oil company PDVA, as salsa music blasted from loudspeakers. “We know that other countries are against Maduro because they want to take over our resources.”Analysts have long held that Mr Maduro’s survival depends on the backing of the military, who he has rewarded with senior positions in government and the state oil company PDVSA.But it is unclear how solid that support is. Mr Guaido and the opposition-held national assembly have sought to peel away the military, offering an amnesty to members of the armed forces who help bring about a return to democracy. This week, authorities arrested 27 national guardsmen who tried to launch an uprising against Mr Maduro.Mr Maduro has accused the opposition of fomenting violence. “I demand the full rigour of the law against the fascists,” he said on Tuesday night. His allies have also threatened the use of armed pro-government militias – known as colectivos – to quell disturbances.A previous spate of protests in 2017 left at least 120 dead and hundreds more injured, after Mr Maduro dispatched the national guard.Foro Penal, a local watchdog, reported on Wednesday morning that 47 protesters had been arrested since protests began on Monday night. Local journalists alleged that authorities in Caracas had attempted to confiscate their equipment. – "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Their babies scored similarly on both physical and intellectual development.The study should help settle the debate over the role of genetics in determining intelligence, which has been rumbling since the publication of Charles Murray’s The Bell Curve in the Nineties. The book argued that a “cognitive elite” was becoming separated from the general population.“There’s still a substantial body of opinion out there in both the scientific and lay communities who genuinely believe that intelligence is predominantly determined by genes and the environment that you’re living in and that your parents and grandparents were living in and their nutritional and health status are not relevant,” said Prof Kennedy. “Well, that’s clearly not the case.” University of OxfordDanny Dyer\u0026#39s Right Royal Family, review: All hail Danny - first a king, now a

maduro accuses mike pence trying force coup venezuela","story":"Clashes broke out ahead of what are expected to be the biggest demonstrations since 2017At least four people have died following overnight clashes ahead of Wednesday\u0027s rival protests in Venezuela by supporters and opponents of President Nicolas Maduro, police and a non-governmental organization said.Thousands were beginning to assemble in Caracas ahead of the rival demonstrations on Wednesday, expected to be the first mass street rallies since 125 people died during protests between April and July, 2017.A 16-year-old was among the dead overnight, having suffered a firearm injury during a demonstration in the capital Caracas, the Social Conflict Observatory said.Police said the other three deaths occurred during looting in Bolivar City in the southeastern Bolivar State that borders Brazil.A statue of iconic socialist revolutionary leader Hugo Chavez, Maduro\u0027s predecessor, was torched by dozens of protesters in the town of San Felix, Bolivar State.Riot police clash with anti-government demonstrators in the neighborhood of Los MecedoresPhotos and videos shared on social media showed the statue, which was vandalized last year, engulfed in flames.Tensions have been running high in the country since Monday when a group of soldiers took over a command post in the north of the capital and rose up against Maduro, publishing a video calling on people to come out into the streets in support.The mutineers were quickly overpowered by police and the armed forces, with 27 people arrested.But the brazen move sparked at least 30 small protests around Caracas, according to the Social Conflict Observatory, with the police firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators.Thousands were beginning to assemble in Caracas ahead of the rival demonstrations on WednesdayThe opposition-controlled parliament had announced Wednesday\u0027s protest earlier this month as the legislature\u0027s president Juan Guaido aims to rally support behind his attempt to chase Maduro from power and set up a transitional government ahead of new elections.The government responded by announcing its own pro-Maduro demonstration on what is a hugely significant date in Venezuela since it was on January 23, 1958 that the dictatorship of Marcos Perez Jimenez fell.Opposition to Maduro\u0027s rule has been stepped up since the former bus driver was sworn in for a second term of office two weeks ago.The election he won in May was boycotted by the opposition and branded a fraud by the European Union, United States and numerous Latin American countries.Venezuela\u0026#39s President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, attend a meeting with supporters in CaracasThe opposition protest aims to support opposition leader Juan Guaidó\u0027s bid to set up a transitional government ahead of new elections.He received support on Tuesday from US Vice-President Mike Pence, whose country has sanctioned top regime figures.Pence wrote on Twitter: As the good people of Venezuela make your voices heard tomorrow, on behalf of the American people, we say: estamos con ustedes. We are with you.Maduro responded by accusing the US, through Pence, of trying to engineer a coup.Venezuela\u0027s government ominously predicted there would be violence against opposition protesters, although claiming it would be self-inflicted in a bid to portray the regime as brutal.Venezuela\u0027s Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez even said Monday\u0027s mutiny, in which soldiers took over a command post in the north of Caracas and called on the public to head to the streets in repudiation of Maduro, was merely a ruse to steal weapons.An anti-government demonstrator throws a Molotov cocktail during clashes with police and troops in the surroundings of a National Guard command post in CotizaUS Senator Marco Rubio warned of manipulation by Venezuela\u0027s intelligence service, urging them to reconsider the plan they have for tomorrow before it\u0027s too late.Monday\u0027s mutiny was quickly put down. Twenty-seven soldiers were arrested and Rodriguez claimed they confessed to handing out weapons to opposition activists so they can carry out acts of violence, (cause) injuries and deaths during the protest.The mutiny sparked at least 30 small protests in different parts of Caracas, according to a non-governmental organization monitoring social conflict. Police used tear gas against some of the demonstrators. Juan Guaido speaks before a crowd of opposition supporters during an open meeting at the Central University of CaracasWe leave the violence to others, Mr Guaido said.Tomorrow is about reuniting as a people to tell the world about the steps we\u0027re going to take to end the usurpation, to achieve a transitional government and a free election.All babies are born equal, no matter their race or classHorizon: We Need to Talk About Death, review: Would better palliative care help us to die happier?Danny Dyer\u0026#39s Right Royal Family, review: All hail Danny - first a king, now a saintDemocrats 2020: Could Kamala Harris make it all the way to the White House?US intelligence official says Brexit will not harm info-sharing relationship with BritainHow 19 Remain ministers dubbed \u0026#39hairshirt\u0026#39 club have met in secret in bid to stop no-deal Brexit Comment: Remainers have sabotaged Mrs May\u0026#39s hopes of a Brexit compromiseNHS chiefs seek assurances over new Edinburgh children\u0026#39s hospital after two Glasgow deathsComment: We in Calais are ready for no deal, why isn\u0026#39t Britain?Labour plots to delay Brexit as Theresa May scrambles to save her deal with new bid to woo Tory MPsUS election 2020: The Democrat candidates who are running for presidentState of the Union cancelled asNancy Pelosi bars Donald Trump from House chamberComment: Dyson\u0026#39s move shows that the Thatcherite dream of a free-market Brexit is dyingUK to pay French £6m for drones for 247 surveillance in bid to stop migrants crossing ChannelRevealed: Condom supplier to NHS and British high street accused of \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 working conditionsPete Buttigieg, little-known 37-year-old mayor once praised by Obama, joins 2020 presidency raceUnited States recognises Venezuela\u0026#39s opposition leader as \u0026#39interim president\u0026#39Priyanka Gandhi launches political career in Indian opposition campaign ahead of national election\u0026#39Drunken\u0026#39 Brit loses foot after lying down on French train trackSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd arrested in former Soviet state of Georgia after handing himself inRussian company creates \u0026#39Our Guys in Salisbury\u0026#39 board game in \u0026#39humorous\u0026#39 response to novichok attack We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/23/TELEMMGLPICT000185944935_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqejI1gRHJsOsGt35KcRG67_zagkgDh9j9BTt63qDTo6s.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pete buttigieg little known 37 year old mayor praised obama","story":"Pete Buttigieg is mayor of South Bend, Indiana, but has never held national political officePete Buttigieg, a little-known 37-year-old mayor, has become the latest Democrat to join the race to become US president in 2020, declaring that America needs a “new generation” of leaders. Mr Buttigieg, seen as a rank outsider, would become the country’s first openly gay president if he managed to win his party’s nomination and then defeat Donald Trump. The two-term mayor of South Bend, a city of 100,000 people in Indiana, was named by Barack Obama, the former president, on a list of gifted young Democrats in an interview published in November 2016. In a short speech and campaign advert on Wednesday, Mr Buttigieg framed the White House bid around his youth as he called for a clean break with the leaders of the past. “The case here is simple – that it’s time for a new generation of leadership in our country,” Mr Buttigieg said. The message was hammered home in a campaign advert in which he said: “I belong to a generation that is stepping forward right now. “We are the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 911. And we’re the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents unless we do something different.”Mr Buttigieg is a Harvard University graduate, Rhodes scholar and former McKinsey consultant who has held no national political office.He turned 37 on Saturday – just two years older than the age minimum to run for president dictated by the US constriction – and would be the youngest ever Oval Office occupant if he got there. Pete Buttigieg served with the Naval Reserve in Afghanistan During his stint as mayor Mr Buttigieg served with the Naval Reserve in Afghanistan and came out as gay. He lives with his husband, Chasten, and two rescue dogs, Truman and Buddy.“I have served my city as a major, I’ve served our country as a military officer and now I’m ready for a new way to serve the American people,” Mr Buttigieg said during his campaign launch. He also referenced his inexperience: “We’ve put together a terrific team. We are not going to be the most established, we are not going to be the most well-funded. I’m obviously not stepping on to this stage as the most famous person in this conversation. “But I belong to a party whose characteristic has always been to look for fresh voices, new leadership and big ideas and I think that’s what 2020 is going to be about.” Fiona Bruce advised to protect herself from online hate as she falls victim to vile Momentum posts All babies are born equal, no matter their race or classDanny Dyer\u0026#39s Right Royal Family, review: All hail Danny - first a king, now a saintHorizon: We Need to Talk About Death, review: Would better palliative care help us to die happier?Democrats 2020: Could Kamala Harris make it all the way to the White House?US intelligence official says Brexit will not harm info-sharing relationship with BritainHow 19 Remain ministers dubbed \u0026#39hairshirt\u0026#39 club have met in secret in bid to stop no-deal Brexit Comment: Remainers have sabotaged Mrs May\u0026#39s hopes of a Brexit compromiseNHS chiefs seek assurances over new Edinburgh children\u0026#39s hospital after two Glasgow deathsComment: We in Calais are ready for no deal, why isn\u0026#39t Britain?Labour plots to delay Brexit as Theresa May scrambles to save her deal with new bid to woo Tory MPsUS election 2020: The Democrat candidates who are running for presidentState of the Union cancelled asNancy Pelosi bars Donald Trump from House chamberComment: Dyson\u0026#39s move shows that the Thatcherite dream of a free-market Brexit is dyingUK to pay French £6m for drones for 247 surveillance in bid to stop migrants crossing ChannelRevealed: Condom supplier to NHS and British high street accused of \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 working conditionsUnited States recognises Venezuela\u0026#39s opposition leader as \u0026#39interim president\u0026#39Priyanka Gandhi launches political career in Indian opposition campaign ahead of national election\u0026#39Drunken\u0026#39 Brit loses foot after lying down on French train trackSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd arrested in former Soviet state of Georgia after handing himself inRussian company creates \u0026#39Our Guys in Salisbury\u0026#39 board game in \u0026#39humorous\u0026#39 response to novichok attack We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 23 january 2019","story":"Kate,  Duchess of Cambridge is reflected in a glass at right, with Family Action CEO David Holmes, obscured, as they speak with people supported by the charity, during a visit to Family Action in south London where she helped launch a new national support line.

Stops include Geneva, Paris, Amsterdam and London, all of them European cities that the two suspects visited before allegedly poisoning Sergei Skripal.The finish line is in Salisbury, which is represented by a cathedral and men in bright green hazmat suits.In keeping with the spy theme, the box features a picture of two men in fake glasses and moustaches.The  could not find the game on Tuesday in the Moscow store listed on the seller\u0027s website. A saleswoman said the shop sold games by the brand but the Salisbury one “probably sold out already”.One of the game\u0027s developers told state media on Wednesday it had created it in response to Western condemnation over the Salisbury attack.We decided to make our humorous answer for our Western neighbours by creating a board game, where our compatriots walk freely in Europe and explore the sights, said Mikhail Bober.GalaMart, the retail company that listed “Our Guys in Salisbury” on its website, confirmed to The  that it sells such a game. The game is sold in a pack of six with other games clearly targeting children, such as \u0026#39World of Fairytales\u0026#39British police charged Russian GRU agents Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov with deploying the nerve agent Novichok that poisoned Sergei and Yulia Skripal and killed Dawn Sturgess. The two men, whose real names were later revealed to be Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin, travelled to Europe numerous times in the two years leading up to the assassination attempt, The  reported.  Conservative Salisbury councillor Jo Broom said the game represented a new level of flippancy about the poisonings, adding: I\u0027m shocked and saddened and I think it\u0027s quite a kick in the teeth for the people of Salisbury when we\u0027re working so hard to get back on track and do lots of positive things for the city.I am surprised by it. I think this is a step beyond isn\u0027t it, really? It\u0027s taking it to another level.“Our Guys in Salisbury” comes in a pack with five others—“Zooworld,” “Tank Battle,” “Big Races,” “The Unbelievable Cosmic Journey” and “World of Fairytales”—that can be purchased for a mere 49 roubles, less than £1.The game is produced under the brand name Igrolend and was discovered on the site of the Yekaterinburg-based retailer GalaMart, as well as its bulk supply arm GalaOpt. When The  phoned a company called Igroland, the development director, who would give his name only as Alexander, insisted his firm bore no relation to Igrolend, although he admitted it sold games produced under the Igrolend brand.Salisbury suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were later unmasked as Russian military intelligence agentsAlexander said he he didn\u0027t know if his company sold the “Our Guys in Salisbury” game. He said the idea was humorous and brushed off questions about whether it was proper to sell a game based on the circumstances of a deadly poisoning.“Thousands die every day. It doesn\u0027t make any difference if one has the name Skripal and another has the name Petrov or Ivanov,” he said. “People make money on lots of things. Better to ask an arms maker how Kalashnikov is doing, how American or Israeli defence firms are doing, you\u0027d do better to find that out. It\u0027s just funny.”Other Russian firms have previously attempted to capitalise on the Salisbury by producing t-shirts and even a craft beer under the name “Novichok”.Additional reporting contributed by Juliana LizerPlease review our commenting policyAll babies are born equal, no matter their race or classDanny Dyer\u0026#39s Right Royal Family, review: All hail Danny - first a king, now a saintHorizon: We Need to Talk About Death, review: Would better palliative care help us to die happier?Democrats 2020: Could Kamala Harris make it all the way to the White House?US intelligence official says Brexit will not harm info-sharing relationship with BritainHow 19 Remain ministers dubbed \u0026#39hairshirt\u0026#39 club have met in secret in bid to stop no-deal Brexit Comment: Remainers have sabotaged Mrs May\u0026#39s hopes of a Brexit compromiseNHS chiefs seek assurances over new Edinburgh children\u0026#39s hospital after two Glasgow deathsComment: We in Calais are ready for no deal, why isn\u0026#39t Britain?Labour plots to delay Brexit as Theresa May scrambles to save her deal with new bid to woo Tory MPsUS election 2020: The Democrat candidates who are running for presidentState of the Union cancelled asNancy Pelosi bars Donald Trump from House chamberComment: Dyson\u0026#39s move shows that the Thatcherite dream of a free-market Brexit is dyingUK to pay French £6m for drones for 247 surveillance in bid to stop migrants crossing ChannelRevealed: Condom supplier to NHS and British high street accused of \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 working conditionsPete Buttigieg, little-known 37-year-old mayor once praised by Obama, joins 2020 presidency raceUnited States recognises Venezuela\u0026#39s opposition leader as \u0026#39interim president\u0026#39Priyanka Gandhi launches political career in Indian opposition campaign ahead of national election\u0026#39Drunken\u0026#39 Brit loses foot after lying down on French train trackSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd arrested in former Soviet state of Georgia after handing himself inEurosceptics soften opposition to Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal as Jacob Rees-Mogg hails \u0026#39outbreak of realism\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/21/airpower.jpg","title":"airpower release date apple charger new latest update iphone","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But repeated rumours have suggested that Apple was in fact working to get AirPower out much earlier, but that technical issues had got in the way of making it available to the public.Those reports chime with similar claims earlier this month that AirPower was on its way and was making its way through Apple\u0027s supply chain. The beginning of production comes after Apple solved the technical issues – thought to be problems with overheating and other challenges – according to numerous reports.When Apple revealed AirPower in September 2017, promising it would be available soon, it showed a rounded charging mat that would allow people to charge phones and Apple Watches alongside AirPods in a special new case. But there has been no sign of the new product – with major events like the release of the iPhone XS and XR passing without a mention.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new models expected to be released in September of this year are likely to keep much the same design as the current models, and so the LCD display is likely to stick around.Apple\u0027s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveLCD displays have largely fallen out of favour in recent years because they use up more battery than rival OLED technology, which also allows for richer blacks. OLED displays can also be arranged into more unusual shapes, allowing for more radical changes in the phones\u0027 design.The new rumour came from a Wall Street Journal report detailing the concerns at Japan Display, which is being hit not only by the dropping of LCD screens but also the relative lack of demand for the new iPhone XR, which uses its screens.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayThe EU intervention enabled Thanington – which I previously featured in the first instalment of this series – to lose its nickname of “Little Beirut”, but its residents complain that they have lacked public investment ever since, and that this is beginning to show. The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash.

After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it.

Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years.

The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand.

He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it.

He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with.

It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future.

Ours is the first scenario that can explain the timing and delivery in a way that is consistent with all the geochemical evidence.Dr\u0026nbspDasgupta said the study could allow humanity to understand more about how the ingredients for life might form on other rocky planets like our own.This study suggests that a rocky, Earth-like planet gets more chances to acquire life-essential elements if it forms and grows from giant impacts with planets that have sampled different building blocks, perhaps from different parts of a protoplanetary disk.The research is published in the journal Science Advances.Additional reporting by Press AssociationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But is this true? Ben Chu\u0026nbspinvestigatesClick to followThe IndependentSome see WTO rules as a simple landing place post BrexitMany Brexiteers have claimed that one of the reasons we shouldn’t fear a no-deal departure\u0026nbspis that lots of\u0026nbspother countries in the\u0026nbspworld already trade\u0026nbspwith each other on basic World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules – the framework the UK would drop into if we left the EU on 29 March with no withdrawal agreement and no transition period.But is this claim actually true?Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, pointed out in an article for The Independent last month that it’s actually misleading.First it’s important to understand what the WTO is and what its rules are.There are 164 WTO member states around the world. The central rule of the club is that no country can impose tariffs on another country’s imports that are higher than those imposed on imports\u0026nbspfrom any other country\u0026nbsp– unless it has established a broad free trade agreement with that country. So if country X gives country Y a reduced tariff,\u0026nbspthat same favour must be granted to all other WTO members.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThis is the “most favoured nation” principle. Its purpose is to prevent ad hoc discrimination on tariffs by countries and the risk of tit-for-tat trade battles.But that does not mean that, in the absence of a free trade agreement, trade between two states can be assumed to be governed only by WTO rules.Take the EU’s trade with the US.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?“All 164 of them have negotiated better access to at least one market through some kind of bilateral agreement in addition to their WTO relationship.”So if the UK suddenly left the EU its trade with the US, at least initially, would still be disrupted because we would lose the coverage over those 100 sector agreements too.The point is that WTO rules are not some kind of tried and tested landing place for a country crashing out of a trade bloc.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Further delays followed in arranging for his travel to Britain, believed to be due to\u0026nbspthe French authorities, but it has now been confirmed that he will arrive on Monday 28 January.Hamish Arnott, his aunt’s solicitor at Bhatt Murphy, said: “This is welcome but long overdue, given that for two years he has had the right to come to the UK.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A couple walk through a park, in High Wycombe, as some areas of the UK see the first snow of the yearTtributes left outside Cardiff City Stadium after a plane carrying their new signing Emiliano Sala disappeared over the English Channel on Monday night.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself.

Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH“We have to have some humility about what we can achieve in\u0026nbsp the private sector but if we can unlock it it’s amazing what you can pull off,” before issuing a warning: “If Africa fails, Europe cannot succeed.”Bono is a co-founder of One, which is a global campaign organisation with more than 10m members seeking to end extreme poverty.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The ‘no deal’ even more so.”At the committee the\u0026nbspchief negotiator elaborated,\u0026nbspwarning\u0026nbspthat the only way to avoid the UK crashing was to endorse another option on the table.“There appears to be a majority in the Commons to oppose a no deal but opposing a no deal will not stop a no deal from happening at the end of March”, he told the committee. “To stop no deal, a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge.”Following the defeat of her withdrawal agreement by the largest margin in the history of parliament, Ms May said she would try and secure a time limit on the controversial backstop policy.But Mr Barnier said: “The question of limiting the backstop in time has already been discussed twice by the European leaders, in November and in December 2018.\u0026nbsp“This backstop is the only one possible because an assurance is no longer operational if it is for a limited time. Imagine if it were to be limited in time and the problem arose after expiry: it is useless!”He was backed up later on Wednesday by Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European Commission.\u0026nbsp“We will support Ireland … the backstop is a red line we cannot negotiate with the British government,” Mr Timmermans told an event in Krakow, Poland. \u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could force schools into ‘lockdown’ due to air qualityWetherspoon’s boss insists no-deal Brexit will help pub chainMinisters push for May to back backstop planBritons heading to EU face delays and questioning after no-deal BrexitIn the weeks since the defeat of the withdrawal agreement the EU has focused on encouraging the PM to revisit her red lines, and signalled its willingness to re-work the so-called “political declaration” that lays out the future trading relationship.Labour and other opposition parties back a much closer economic relationship with the EU, floating possibilities like common single market standards and a customs union.Mr Barnier suggested the question of the backstop would “become relative” if the future relationship was revisited – signalling that it might be a way out of the current impasse.“If the British government wishes to revisit the future relationship and be more ambitious, then it would be possible to agree on the global package and the question of the ‘backstop’ would become relative,” he said.“If I understand the British debates right there is a desire to find a way. But if the government and the MPs don’t move their lines, we are going inevitably into ‘no deal’.”The prime minister has repeatedly\u0026nbspruled out shifting her red lines on issues like a customs union and free movement.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThe political backdrop to Mr Barnier’s comments is increasingly complicated. The Commons is considering a new amendment to rule out a no-deal Brexit – forcing the government to seek an extension or revocation of Article 50 if the UK gets too close to the deadline without an agreement.But in Ireland, the government is facing a political backlash over suggestions a hard border would return if Britain crashes out. Leo Varadkar’s cabinet was put in a tight spot earlier in the week after a Commission spokesperson said there would “obviously” be new infrastructure in the event the withdrawal agreement was not signed. Though Mr Barnier appeared to endorse this suggestion in ensuing interviews, by Wednesday afternoon he had apparently softened his tone by suggesting there could be another way around the problem.That concession itself, however, is likely to fuel opposition to the withdrawal agreement in Westminster – where Eurosceptic MPs are likely to interepret Mr Barnier’s latest comments as an admission that the backstop, which they fiercely oppose,\u0026nbspis not necessary. They may also be emboldened by a suggestion by the Polish foreign minister earlier in the week that the EU should accept a time limit on the backstop, as the MPs demand.As a result, the chances of the Commons coming around to passing\u0026nbspthe withdrawal agreement look slimmer than ever.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ben Bradshaw called it important progress and David Lammy tweeted: This is a big step foward. I hope this amendment can be the beginning of the end of years of argument over Berxit in this country.But while more than 70 Labour MPs have publicly called for another referendum, dozens of\u0026nbspothers are strongly opposed, including shadow ministers who would likely resign in order to vote against any proposal for going back to the public.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentSoon after the party\u0027s motion was tabled, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn announced that should would step down if she is ordered to vote for another referendum.In a letter to constituents, she wrote: I am not in favour of a People\u0027s Vote and will not vote for it. If it comes before parliament as it is expected to in the next few daysweeks, I will instead vote for a better \u0027Labour\u0027 deal.This may mean that I am required to step down from my frontbench housing role if it is a whipped vote. I would be very disappointed if this were the case, as I am very proud of the work I have been doing alongside John Healey and Sarah Jones, but recognise that I cannot vote against the frontbench and remain a part of it.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspshadow business secretary, said the amendment would simply\u0026nbspwiden the debate and put all options on the table to avoid a no-deal scenario but that the party\u0027s priority remained securning\u0026nbspa different Brexit deal, including a customs union with the EU and a closer relationship with the\u0026nbspsingle market.\u0026nbspAsked if\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s motion\u0026nbspmakes a second referendum\u0026nbspmore likely,\u0026nbspshe told Sky News: Well, no.

It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February. With significant cross-party support, the motion is likely to pass if Labour agrees to support it.Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit commitee, has put down a separate amendment calling for MPs to hold a series of indicative votes on various Brexit outcomes.And Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is expected to propose giving parliament to right to seize\u0026nbspcontrol of Brexit if the government cannot pass its deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I hope the French people can shortly make different choices,” he said, referring to May’s European elections.The French government condemned the remarks as “unacceptable” and said Mr Salvini should be reminded of diplomatic “boundaries”.Yellow vest protesters try to storm Macron’s presidential retreat“These unfounded statements should be read in the context of domestic Italian politics. They are unacceptable,” France’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said.She added that for Franco-Italian relations to remain friendly and cooperative, certain standards should be adhered to.Mr Salvini’s anti-immigration Northern League party is set to make significant gains in the coming European parliament elections. Other far-right outfits across the bloc are also expected to do well – reflecting results at a national level since the last EU-wide contest in 2014.Although Mr Macron’s insurgent En Marche! party is contesting the elections for the first time, it faces an\u0026nbspuphill struggle to dominate the field, with the president’s approval ratings low even by French standards.Mr Salvini and other far-right groups have talked about creating an anti-immigration “axis” in the EU to change the bloc’s policies – provocatively borrowing terminology associate with the Third Reich.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators hold a huge banner reading \u0027Madrid\u0027s taxi demands that the law has to be enforced\u0027 as drivers protest outside IFEMA Convention and Congress Center, against the regulation of ride-hailing and car-sharing services such as Uber and CabifyFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel shake hands after signing a French-German friendship treaty in the town hall of Aachen, western Germany.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The margin was higher than expected because some Labour MPs abstained, highlighting deep unease in the party about its leader’s fitness for high office.In contrast, even after a sobering setback, Theresa May signalled her determination to seek further concessions from Brussels.Mr Corbyn rebuffed the Prime Minister’s offer of talks unless she ruled out leaving with No Deal. If only he took such an uncompromising stance towards terrorists and despots. In reality, Jeremy Corbyn has no idea what Labour’s policy on Brexit would be.The path ahead is set in law. The UK will leave the EU in  days’ time — preferably with a deal,not on World Trade Organisation terms.  If Labour wants to reverse that legislation, it will require government backing — and the PM has made clear she won’t support it.The EU has asked to hear what alternatives the UK would accept. So this is a moment of truth, a test for the EU. Are they serious about a deal The Government must seek two essential changes. First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result. Pushing back the exit date would just prolong the anguish of this tortuous haggle with Brussels.None look capable of ­mustering support from a majority of MPs. I am struck by how many Remain voters — let alone Leavers — now just want to see Brexit done.It’s time for politicians to re-focus on boosting jobs, easing the cost of living and ensuring high-quality schools and NHS services. But the British people won’t move on from Brexit until their ­politicians keep their promises on Brexit.We’ve argued long enough. It’s time for some national self-belief.  People heard the risks and, yes, we need to manage them. But voters also expect their politicians to offer a more optimistic vision of post-Brexit Britain and grasp the opportunities.We will control our laws and our immigration policy. We will continue to trade in Europe, but broaden our global horizons — which is good for creating jobs, boosting wages, and offering UK consumers cheaper goods and wider choice.We should put rocket boosters up the economy by cutting business taxes and raise the threshold of National Insurance employee contributions to save workers more than £ each year.While we’re at it, a more robust pro-competition policy at home would give small businesses the opportunity to break into markets, end consumer rip-offs and offer customers better deals.Enough wrangling. It’s time to leave the EU and deliver a better post-Brexit UK economy for workers, small businesses and consumers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy. History won’t be kind to him.The Government he is destabilising is the only prayer Leavers have.Their betrayal by Labour is close, and inevitable.Labour’s Brexit chief Keir Starmer now admits that he aims to secure a second referendum — then campaign, and vote, for Remain.If that’s not Corbyn’s policy, why isn’t Starmer fired All the chaos brings Theresa May ever closer to an election.One in which every Tory Remainer plotting to kill Brexit must be deselected and replaced.With candidates who stay loyal to voters and make promises they intend to keep.SADIQ Khan’s “poll tax” on drivers looks like the biggest disaster of his inglorious tenure as London Mayor.We know he is a lightweight who prefers virtue-signalling to fixing the city’s problems. But this insane pollution charge could prove fatal to his prospects.Not only is his scheme, to hammer drivers in his Ultra Low Emissions Zone, vastly expensive to set up, it will barely improve air quality. All those who cannot replace their old car with a “cleaner” new model will be clobbered.Which of course hits the lowest-paid hardest. And, naturally, other left-wing councils nationwide are following suit.How very “progressive” it all is.NO ONE expects a flag-waving jamboree on the th anniversary of troops being deployed to Northern Ireland. But why would the MoD not mark it at all It is a snub of a piece with the hounding of veterans over their actions decades ago.It stems from a corrosive political correctness in modern politicians’ attitudes towards our role in the Troubles, where , troops died quelling the IRA’s campaign of slaughter.Labour may be led by pensioner revolutionaries who supported the terrorists.That’s no reason for the Tories to forget who the good guys were — and their bravery in securing the peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463397365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sob stories ruined sas who dares wins","story":"A political decision that was clearly designed to distract voters and get an easy round of applause.Two things that were never going to stop Channel  enforcing the same rules at its own brilliant version of selection, SAS: Who Dares Wins, evenit was the last show on television that needed any fixing.Its three series have been close to works of art, in fact, largely thanks to their breathtaking settings and four instructors, Ant Middleton, Jason Fox, Matthew Ollerton and Mark Billingham, who gave it such an air of authenticity you could suspend disbelief and imagine you were watching the real thing.As the show’s introduction would have it, though, everything’s changed and they’re a band of brothers no more.The fourth run has  female recruits including a mole called Petra who’s served, for nine years, with Swedish Special forces, on their “front line”.A place which — full ignorant disclosure — I didn’t think extended much beyond the first day of Ikea’s January sales when it all kicks off on Malmo High Street, but actually involved several tours of Afghanistan.Her job here was to spy on all the contestants, and Petra’s certainly done a better job than the production team, because I’ve been watching it for three weeks and can only name three men.First to show, in Chile, was a Muslim called Qash, who voluntarily withdrew after discovering he’d have to share bathroom facilities with the women .  There’s also been no avoiding mentally fragile Nathaniel, or Milo, who’s so camp he makes Alan Carr sound like Lee Marvin.The rest of the  blokes, though, have just become anonymous blips on the horizon while the camera fixates on the women.Among their favourites have been: Saranya, who became the first candidate ever to shout “WHEEEEEEEEEE!” during the ft abseil, tattooed Tracey, blunt Aberdonian Lou, with the voice that goes through you like a rusty bayonet, and television natural Louise, who was the only woman bold enough to challenge a man in the boxing round, and suffered an uncomfortable beating for her troubles.Standards y, but the brutal, straight-down-the-line approach of the four instructors rarely wavers on screen, no matter the gender or how much noise they make.“You having a baby ”“No staff.”“Then shut the f*** up.”This is why you’d probably trust Ant Middleton and the other three with your lives.Politicians and TV people, on the other hand, I trust about as far as I could piggy-back them up the Andes.Almost no encouragement is needed, butyou give them any they will try to reduce every show on TV to one long procession of box-ticking contestants with a crowd-pleasing, right-on ­conclusion.That’s why the most over-worked recruit on this series is the pianist on sob story duties.It may always have had an element of this, of course, but the point when the scales really fell from my eyes was Sunday’s voluntary withdrawal of Nathaniel, who left a letter for the other weeping recruits announcing: “This is just the start of my journey.”You wish him well, obviously, but use of the dreaded J-word wasn’t just the moment I could no longer suspend disbelief, it was also the moment I started to think television was turning SAS selection into Bootcamp on The X Factor.Andthat’s the case, Channel  can have my badge. I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week. The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The Burger And The King is a documentary about which singer’s eating habits ”Gianluca: “Billie Jean King.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “If I meow, what animal am I ”Poppy: “A goat.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an  poem, what season of the year does Keats describe as ‘the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Joe Lycett: “The fictional Champion the Wonder Horse is actually a what ”Ben: “A zebra.”. THIS Morning handover of the week. Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos. And Jeremy Kyle’s captions offering us: “My deceased mother told me on the way to Peter Andre that my dad is my step-dad.” A family trauma so painful, it could not cease until he’d closed the set with Mysterious Girl.GREAT Sporting Insights.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When they cried and said sorry I forgave them. I never learnt.Now in her early s, she has had plastic surgery to recover from her injuries, but still has both physical and emotional le-long scars.The Yakuza are believed to run the Japanese sex trade, where they lure in women from around the world with promises of visas, only to take their passport and drive them into debt so they are forced to work in brothels - its thought they are capitalising on Asias growing status as a destination for sex tourism.Surveys have found  per cent of Japanese men have paid for sex and  per cent of junior and high school girls have been solicited by middle-aged men.And their network of brothels is not limited to Japan, but also Korea, Thailand and the Philippines where foreigners would fly specically to for sex parties.There has, to date, been just one female Yakuza leader, Fumiko Taoka, who briefly led her dead husband Kazuo Taokas gang until a new male leader was chosen in  As well as having heavily-tattooed bodies, the Yakuza can often be identied by their lack of a pinky finger.This is because members - who are initiated into gangs with sword-fighting and meditation lessons - have them amputated as punishmentthey step out of line, usually because they are unable to pay off gambling debts or fail to complete a task such as a killing or importing drugs.The process known as yubitsume - which translates to finger shortening - dates back to the eighteenth century when the pinky finger was key for helping to grip the Japanese Kendo sword.Without it, warriors are weaker and more reliant on their leader.Today the ritual involves the member chopping it off themselves before handing it over to their boss who keeps it as a trophy.If gang members continue to offend their bosses, they either face more yubitsume, or expulsion.The latter is the worst punishment, as those who are kicked out are unable to associate with gang members for the rest of their lives.Former Yakuza members who have since ed to non-criminal society can struggle to find work due to their associations with the gang, so often wear specially-made prosthetic fingers - costing £, - to disguise it.The practice of finger shortening is thought to have died out in recent decades because it is an easy way for police to identy possible criminals.Despite their violent ways, the gang has a white collar image, which sees them have offices, registered members, business cards, press conferences and be praised for helping the  earthquake and tsunami relief funds.They sent trucks from the Tokyo and Kobe regions to deliver food, water, blankets and toiletries to evacuation centres in northeast Japan - getting there quicker than the Japanese authorities.“Yakuza are dropouts from society,” said author Manabu Miyazaki, the son of a former Yakuza boss, toldrecently. They’ve suffered, and they’re just trying to help other people who are in trouble.In Japan, tattoos are almost entirely associated with being a member of the Yakuza - the ,-strong organised crime syndicate which has shocked the world with its ruthless illegal business dealings in drugs and firearms, organ trading and sex trafficking.Their most notorious leader Kazuo Taoka was nicknamed The Bear, as he had a penchant for clawing at his opponents eyes.He once survived being shot in the neck, and his attacker was found weeks later dead in woodland near Kobe.The Yakuza are also known for their brazen assassinations - which happen as often in broad daylight as under the cover of darkness.And in , the Mayor of Nagasaki, Itcho Ito, was shot twice in the back by a gang member, Tesuya Shiroo, over his administrations refusal to choose Yakuza firms for lucrative construction contracts.Before that, in , the particularly-violent Yakuza family, the Kudo-kai, who are based in Kitakyushu, gunned down a -year-old man who refused to give them favourable treatment for public works projects.A spate of violence will often follow funerals of murdered members, which, interestingly, members of all groups will often attend.At their height, the Yakuza had a massive , members.Infighting between gangs is often bloody -  one series of clashes left  dead and more than  injured in a matter of days in , in a country which has an extraordinarily low murder rate.The American Mafia only had an estimated , members at its peak - whereas the Yakuzas largest gang, the Yamaguchi-gumi in Kobe, alone recently listed , membersAmong the many famous illegal Yakuza enterprises - which has in the past included helping former Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka secure his leadership by paying off members of a rival party, is organ trading, including kidneys and livers.In , a doctor, Toshinobu Horiuchi was arrested after it was discovered he was collaborating with the Yakuza to fake an adoption in order to obtain organs.He was suffering from kidney failure and needed a new one. He met the we of a Yakuza in a bar who promised to source him a new one for £,.They planned to help him adopt a -year-old male stranger - as organ donation is only available between family members in Japan - so the man could pass on his healthy kidney.In recent decades the Yakuza have also helped Japanese kidney patients travel to Taiwan and Singapore to purchase organs without consent from executed prisoners.The demand is exacerbated by the fact that Japanese culture doesnt believe in organ donation, and because Yakuza tattoos - so thick they block sweat from leaving the body - take a toxic toll on members livers.In , there was outrage in the United States when Tadamasa Goto, founder of gang the Goto-gumi, struck a deal with the FBI where he would give them information on the Yakuza and donate money to UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angelesthey helped arrange liver transplants for him and three of his associates.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He sped off.I was surprised that the guy managed to control the car and not end up in a ditch on the side of the road.[Len] did really well to control the car and not tip it over. He didnt actually hit the other car - I dont know how. He must have just skimmed it.The driver of that other car on the left chased him down with us because he was so angry he nearly hit him too.After ensuring the couple were safe, Aston and the driver of another vehicle that was narrowly missed followed the Toyota, finding the owner hiding at a nearby car wash.According to Aston, the reckless driver tried to blame the older couple for the collision and refused to admit fault.Aston said: He got away from us, but we knew the direction he went and saw his car hidden at a car wash.I got out my car and luckily he wasnt aggressive, but he was blaming Len in the red car.He said you see him hit me  you see him hit me I couldnt believe that hed driven like that then tried to blame the elderly couple. He wasnt sorry at all for it.He could have killed him and not known because hed sped ahead.Aston spoke to the Ford Fiesta driver after the crash to send him footage of the incident and claims he was told the police were not investigating as no-one was injured or killed.However Kent Police have now come back to confirm officers are looking into the crash.Aston said: The police are looking into it but they werent interested in first place because no-one was injured or killed.Theres been a few crashes on that bridge - its quite a steep cross-over. A quite famous one was a -car pile-up five years ago.They have an average speed camera but I think a lot of people assume theyre not turned on or working because Ive seen loads of people speeding.That whole stretch people drive really fast.A spokesperson for Kent Police said: Kent Police is investigating a collision which is reported to have taken place on the Sheppey Crossing on the afternoon on Monday  January .The incident is reported to have involved three vehicles and no injuries were reported.Officers are conducting ongoing enquiries to establish the full circumstances."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KH-COMPOSITE-GRAPH-UNEMPLOYMENT-4.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jobs up economy up earnings up so what happened to predictions of brexit bust","story":"Job numbers, average earnings and GDP growth are all on the up, while the deficit continues to fall.Brexiteers have welcomed the news - insisting it shows Britain is well prepared to quit the EU.The economic boost flies in the face of dire warnings about how the UK would suffervoters opted to quit the EU in .More Brits are in work than ever before - and new stats released yesterday show the employment boom is continuing.A total of .million have jobs, with , added to the economy in the last three months alone.Unemployment stands at just  per cent, its lowest level in  years.That is less than half the level in France - while in Italy and Spain the jobless rate is more than  per cent.After a two-year squeeze on wages, average pay has been climbing back upwards in recent months.Salaries stand at £, a year - up . per cent on a year earlier.That means wages are outpacing inflation by . per cent, increasing the spending power of Brits.The International Monetary Fund says Britain is now on course to grow faster than Germany and Italy.The UKs expected GDP growth is . per cent this year and . per cent in , more than most other large rich countries.If Mrs May does get a Brexit deal through Parliament, the economy could grow even more, the IMF said.Meanwhile Frances growth is being held back by the yellow vests street protests and Italy is damaged by a huge spending splurge.After more than eight years of austerity, Britain is finally seeing the benefits of the spending squeeze.Borrowing over the past year is at its lowest level since  as the gap between public spending and tax revenues falls.And the pile of public debt is shrinking as a proportion of GDP - although it still adds up to £.trillion."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004617682221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markles hunky new press secretary sets pulses racing","story":"The Duchess of Sussex, , is understood to have hired Christian Jones to handle her media affairs as she prepares to welcome her first child this spring.It comes after the pair were spotted leaving a posh Italian restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, on Friday.Jones official title is Deputy Communications Secretary and works for both Meghan and Harry - as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, according to E!

A new political party, which represents what a lot of us want.Because you’ve got to say — the parties in Westminster aren’t doing that, are they Whatever happens at the end of this awful Brexit mess, one thing is clear, our politics have to change.The isions between our current parties no longer reflect the isions in the country. If Brexit has told us anything, it’s told us that.And there is a growing anger out there that the views of millions and millions of people are simply not represented in Parliament.That’s obvious from Brexit — more than a third of Labour voters wanted us to leave. Including a majority in some northern constituencies. Almost two thirds of Tory voters wanted us to leave.Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, has already said he fancies creating a new party. A Brexit Party.Good luck to the man — I might even join it, because I have the horrible feeling our Parliament is going to betray the people, and we’ll end up staying in. That would be a travesty of democracy.The very reasons which convinced more than million of us to vote for Brexit were the same as those which are causing isions across Europe. And as a result we’ve seen the huge rise of populist parties. In Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, France and even Germany. Oh — and, of course — the USA.These parties are sometimes right wing, sometimes left wing. In Italy there is an alliance between the two.What they are all, though, is dferent to the politics we have now. They are parties which listen to the people. Populist is just another way of saying popular, really.Most agree on a whole bunch of issues. We need to control immigration, number one. Especially immigration from Islamic countries.We need a bit more respect for the nation state: People feel proud of the countries in which they live. Yes, even some Belgians.A lot are socially conservative. By which I mean they do not have much time for gender neutral toilets, LGBTQI protests, political correctness and so on.Instead, they have a respect for traditional values. For the family, for the Christian faith, on which our countries were founded. For our histories. And they are sceptical of the European Union.But they also recognise that there are deep economic isions within our countries which need to be addressed. In our own country a terrible chasm between the affluence and influence of London, versus the rest of the country. Between rich and poor.We have no political party right now which covers those bases.But that is where the real ide in society lies. So, as January drags on — how about a party  One that represents US Labour MP Diane Abbott thinks that the BBC Question Time programme discriminated against her because she is:a blackAbbott got a rough ride and the audience spent most of the time laughing at her or booing.Diane, listen. It’s not your skin colour. It’s not your gender.It’s something  altogether.We are used to politicians speaking down to us.And we are used to politicians being thick.But when both occur at the same time, that’s when the rest of us decide we’ve had enough.Stuff the BBC won’t tell you.Number One – The International Monetary Fund has admitted it got its projections wrong.The UK economy is not stagnating. Economic growth for the next year will be every bit as strong as in France and Germany.And meanwhile all the other indicators – investment, employment, growth in wages – are MUCH better than those in the European Union.Someone tell Huw Edwards.Yet again I’ve accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman without checkingshe’s a proper woman, rather than a porno sock-puppet.Sure enough, within the minute, I was invited to view intimate photographs of the lady.And she ended her invitation with the words: “Slap my frog, cowboy!”Why would I want to slap her frog  I hope her frog has a long and happy le. And why am I a cowboyTheres nothing funnier than slebs making idiots of themselves while politically grandstanding.Gary Lineker, for example, does it every week. His intellect is about as radiant as a candle flame in an aircraft hangar. But he still gives it large, ranting about Brexit. And praising Europe’s worst leader, France’s Emmanuel Macron.The latest slebs to fall foul are the Spice Girls. They posed for photos in “edgy”T-shirts reading: Gender Justice. Now it’s been revealed those shirts were made in a workshop by women who are paid p per hour.There’s gender justice for you.The memorial to Bomber Command in London’s Hyde Park has been defaced by scumbags.They threw paint over the sculpture – and also vandalised statues of Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Our pilots in World War Two won a battle against all the odds to protect this country from fascism. More than , of them died doing so.The filth who vandalised the memorial know nothing of that. Nothing of personal sacrice, of hardship, of discipline.And they know nothing of history, full stop.What kind of people are we raising in this country So, huge congratulations to Ant McPartlin.The perpetually smirking Geordie munchkin won “best presenter” at the National Television Awards, despite not having been on television for a year.People have criticised the decision, but I’m all in favour.Andhe promises to stay off the screens for another  months, I’d give him next year’s award, tooDid you see the shots of the babes turning up for the National Television Awards I call them babes because it was minus ten or something out there. And they rolled up to stand on the red carpet outside in flimsy dresses slit from ankle to lady garden. Freezing their cloppers off – like Emily Atack.One woman was dressed in what seemed to be a small bit of string. Talk about chapel hat pegs.I’ll stop calling them babes and start calling them Very Real Women Who Must Be Appreciated For Their Brilliant Talents Not Their Looks when they turn up for these events in a nice warm parka, a woollen muffler and some Ugg boots.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure. Without this problem it could still fly.Germany holds the key.If Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer means what she said about friendship, now is the time to prove it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps Mr Mercer didnt get to the bit later in the video when Ms Merkel talked about the relationship shed like to see with the UK. After Brexit, she said, we and Britain orce in a good process and work closely on defence, counter-terrorism, security, policing, trade and research projects. Ms Merkel made the comments during the signing of a French-German friendship treaty with Emmanuel Macron yesterday.  She said: The relationship of Great Britain to Europe was always very patchy. They abstained from many of the policies. They are not in the euro zone, they are not part of the free travel area, they dont take part in domestic policies. They have always said: we are an island, we want more independence.

Government loyalist Andrew Murrison tabled an amendment to Theresa Mays Withdrawal Bill to set an expiry date on the Northern Ireland backstop.   The amendment was not chosen by the Speaker and the PMs deal was rejected by  votes.On Monday Theresa May ed to the Commons to put forward her plan B - which involves minor tweaks to her first plan.MPs are now putting forward amendments to try and seize control of the process.Mr Murrison believes his amendment, which imposes a time-limit on the backstop, could help Mrs May get her deal through the Commons by appealing to moderate MPs who just want Brexit sorted. But Mr Barnier has insisted there can be no time limit on the backstop.He told them: The backstop is like an insurance. It is not there to be used. Andso, only provisionally. However, we cannot tie the backstop to a time limit.   Asked why not, he told journalists: Imagineyour home’s insurance was limited to five years and you’d have a problem after six years... Thats dficult to justy, he replied. Its similar with the backstop. That is why it is tied to an event: as soon as there is an agreement between the EU and the UK that makes an internal border unnecessary, it will be obsolete. Let me remind you that we have negotiated the elements of the backstop with the British government and have integrated their wishes into it. On Tuesday the EU insisted that a no deal Brexit would mean a hard border on the island of Ireland.At a press conference the chief spokesman for European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, said it was “pretty obvious” border infrastructure would be necessarythere was no agreement.   But on Wednesday they backtracked. The same spokesman said: The EU is determined to do all it can - deal or no deal- to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Meanwhile the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissionsaid the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the UK and the EU left signicant gaps in the protection of human rights. Emily Logan said: I dont think the public understand that the implications... people might find themselves in a situation of being forced to assume an identy they wouldnt choose. Ms Logan said the offer of continued EU citizenship should be extended to all the people of NorthernIreland as defined by the Good Friday Agreement, given recognition of the birthright of people in NorthernIrelandto identy as Irish or British, or both. The last situation we wish to see is one where the people of NorthernIrelandfeel forced to choose their identity based on what they think their post-Brexit entitlements might be, she said.

Some %, worth poundmillion, was sourced from outside the UK. Experts were unable to say where the other %, worth poundmillion, came from.  A bombshell breakdown for   shows that while Whitehall departments bought some British steel, they also imported metals from overseas - including when they could have opted to buy British.Campaigning Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: “It is a national disgrace that despite repeated promises to buy quality British-made steel, not even half being used in key projects is home produced.”Highways England bought just a fth of the steel needed for smart motorway technology signposts on the M from UK suppliers - despite admitting it was all available from British producers. Only pound, of the pound, budget went to UK firms. It said: “% of requirement can be produced in UK. pound,was produced in UK.”  The Education and Skills Funding Agency, part of the Department for Education, bought % of the rebar needed for school buildings from UK manufacturers - even though all of it needed for the pound, contract could have been sourced in Britain.  It admitted: “% of requirement can be produced in UK. Value from UK producers not currently recorded, % was from UK suppliers.” The Ministry of Defence spent poundmillion on French steel for its new Dreadnought-class nuclear-armed submarines.  Some , tonnes of steel worth pound.million was supplied from Belgium for a Royal Navy Astute-class hunter-killer submarine. And pound.million of steel - , tonnes - including some from Sweden, was bought for Royal Navy Type  frigates. The MoD said “Not all of the required specications for Type  steel are manufactured in the UK. Thin plate steel is sourced from overseas .” For the Astute sub, it added: “This grade of steel is only available from France, due to its specialist nature.”  However, British firms have repeatedly insisted thatthey are given enough time, they could produce specialist products. Network Rail bought , tonns of steel, mainly from Austria and Spain, for two “niche projects”, together worth almost pound,million. It claimed “technical specications” were required. But Mr Doughty added: “Whether it’s roads, rail or our national defence the Tory Government is letting down the nation and betraying our steelworkers by a failure to buy British.”  Paul McBean, , a steelworker at Scunthorpe for  years, said: “We’ve had a rough few years in the industry, and steelworkers have all done their bit to help keep things afloat. “Government ministers keep saying they support British steel making, but they’ve got to put their money where their mouth it. “Publishing this information is helpful, butthey’re serious about helping our industry survive and thrive then the Government will have to do an awful lot better when it comes to buying British steel.” The figures were set out in a -page document called ‘Steel Public Procurement: Compliance with the steel procurement guidance’ published by the Department for business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Community steelworkers’ union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “Getting procurement policy right is crucial to developing an industrial strategy that supports UK steelmaking, and government should be leading the way.  “British steelworkers are the best in the world but we’ve always said we need to make public procurement policy work for our home industries just like they do in other countries.” The “data means we can hold government to account”, he said, adding: “There is much room for improvement.” Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the Government of “failing to lend support” to the fragile British steel sector. Mr Kinnock, whose constituency includes Britain’s biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “The steel industry is the industrial backbone of the United Kingdom.  Mr Kinnock added: “It’s a huge betrayal to steel communities like mine in Aberavon that the UK Government are procuring less than % of their steel from British steelworks. “The fact is that this is a betrayal of British steelworkers and of their families and communities. “These decisions are made in Westminster and the Government should be putting its money where its mouth is. “There is, of course, an alternative. The Labour Party’s Build it in Britain campaign will use a mix of public procurement and a new National Investment Bank to boost manufacturing across the country, contrasting greatly with the Tories’ abject failure to back British business.” UK Steel director Gareth Stace welcomed “important and positive steps” from the Government, including publishing the data.

Jeremy Corbyn cherry picked the best questions put by his backbenchers and put them again to the Prime Minister. They were all reasonable issues to raise with Mrs May but they lacked any sense of originality. So for the second time he asked why she would not rule out a no deal. And for the second time he askedher mind was closed to a customs union.  Mrs May kindly colluded with the Labour leader by giving the exact same responses as she delivered three days earlier. Like her opposite number, she also lacked spontaneity and crowdsourced her answers from observations on Twitter. She pointed out, with a mock sense of hurt, that Mr Corbyn had been willing to talk to Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but was unwilling to meet with her. Mr Corbyn responded by borrowing Hilary Benn’s observation that the PM’s door may be open but the “mind was closed.” Mrs May then chose the curious tactic of following her renewed invitation to the Labour leader for talks by insulting him over his knowledge of Brexit. “I don’t think he knows what these phrases mean or what these phrases are,” she said. Mr Corbyn was on stronger ground by noting that Labour’s plan to stay in the customs union was backed by both the TUC and the CBI.  He perhaps missed an opportunity by not raising the exodus from the UK by countries such as Dyson and Sony. Brexit Kremlinologists will have noted that Mrs May did not rule out membership of a customs union in answer to Corbyn’s questions. But as whole this PMQs did not take us much further forward other to remind viewers that both leaders are wedded to intransigence. It took questions from Labours Sarah Jones on Grenfell and John Mann on mental health to remind you that Prime Ministers questions is not a completely wasteful exercise.

Tiredness, heavy workloads and a lack of exercise mean less than one third of the year is spent feeling in tip top condition, both mentally and physically. Instead, the average adult will have three days a week where they feel tired or lacking in energy, and two occasions where they spend the day in a bad mood. More than one third of adults even have whole months go by where they don’t have a single day of feeling on top form.   The study by Vitabiotics’ Wellwoman and Wellman vitamin range also found January is the month most likely to see Brits struggling. A spokesman said: “At this time of year, it can be rare to have a day where you feel wide awake, in a great mood and ready for whatever le throws at you. “But it’s staggering to see just how few days we have where we feel great. “Simply feeling a little bit tired, or overloaded at work, can leave us feeling out of sorts – it really doesn’t take much to take our day from perfect to just so-so.   “Sometimes, just making small lestyle changes, like improving your diet or doing a little bit of exercise, can make a huge dference to how you feel, hopefully boosting the time you spend feeling on top form.” The study also found  per cent of Brits admit they are more likely to have days where they feel tired or be in a bad mood than feel completely perfect. And  per cent say it’s rare for them to wake up and feel like they are raring to go as soon as they get out of bed. In fact, the average adult has less than four hours a day where they feel full of energy.   A bad night’s sleep is most likely to leave Brits feeling anything less than tip top, along with stress, going to bed too late and having an early wake up call. A bad or busy day at work, a poor diet and an argument with someone are also among the most common reasons for having days where they feel a little lousy. Worryingly,  per cent even said they have fallen out with someone as a result of not feeling completely perfect, with many respondents admitting to being snappier than usual when they are tired. Researchers also found  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, have pulled a sickie at work because they didn’t feel in the mood to go in, and almost one in five have pretended to have an appointment to get out of having to go in first thing.   More than half have even cancelled a night out with friends because they didn’t feel up to it and  per cent have pulled out of a date. A spokesman for Vitabiotics Wellman and Wellwoman added: “It is worrying that so few Brits feel genuinely in tip-top physical condition and it goes to show how important a good diet and plenty of sleep is for the demands of today’s modern lestyle. For those wanting to stay on top, Wellman and Wellwoman provides micronutrient support with over  vitamins and minerals, plus more. “If you are having one of those days, Wellman and Wellwoman Energy is the ideal addition to tablets when you want an extra boost of energy releasing vitamins. Both make a great tasting refreshing drink with vitamins B and B, magnesium and iron which contribute to normal energy release and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue.” Top  things which cause Brits to feel less than tip top:A bad night’s sleep Stress Going to bed late the night before Having to wake up early A bad day at work A bad diet An argument with their partner Not getting in their usual amount of exercise A hefty workload Drinking too much"},{"url":null,"title":"burglar claimed moved home after","story":"NewsBurglar claimed he moved into home after popstar Cheryl donated it to himAndrew Coates, , appeared on several hours of CCTV footage with a rucksack and sleeping bag inside the Devon home of Alison Piper, a jury heardShareByStuart AbelAbigail OLeary:,  JAN NewsAppearing at Plymouth Crown Court, Coates denied burgling the property in March last year \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn alleged burglar caught inside a house claimed he had moved into the property after it was donated to him by popstar Cheryl, a court heard.

Andrew Samuel, , watched the sunset with Natalie Morris, , after travelling to the idyllic island of Lembongan. The hearing was told it was the couples first night on the small Indonesian island and they had been on a moped, gone for a meal and ed to their villa to watch DVDs. The couple had been sipping Bombay Sapphire gin and tonics by their small private pool after getting back at around .pm. Andrew said: It was literally one of the most perfect evenings that you could have had. It was just really nice. We got to the island and it was such a picturesque island.  Andrew said the couple had watched the sunset and discussed plans on what to do for Natalies th birthday. He said: We were making plans for the future. It was such a nice day there was nothing sad about it at all. The inquest heard Andrew went to bed around midnight but Natalie decided to stay up to finish her drink and have a cigarette. But Andrew woke up at .am to discover his girlfriend had not come to bed and he rushed outside. The inquest heard Natalie was discovered face down in the pool of the Secret Outlook villa and desperate Andrew ed in to save her and carried out CPR.   Emergency services were called but Natalie was pronounced dead on September  last year. The inquest heard there was a partly smoked cigarette and a lighter about a foot from the edge of the pool. Andrew said: My hypothesis of what happened is that I think Nat had been having a cigarette. I think she was probably, knowing her, having a dance and I assume she must have been on the side of the pool. I believe that she must have slipped, hit her head on the side of the pool and unfortunately rolled the wrong way. Because she was tall enough to stand up in the pool. If she was not unconscious she would have been able to stand up. From where the cigarette was it looked like she would have fallen and dropped it.   The inquest heard the couple had been sitting on decking that was about six foot from the pool. There was outdoor lighting and the private pool and garden were securely locked with a ten foot wall surrounding it. Andrew said they were onlytipsy after enjoying a few drinks and he heard nothing after going to bed. He added: If there was a shout I think I would have heard it. The inquest heard the couple had only just decided to go to Lembongan after a typhoon had changed their original plans. A post mortem examination in Bali found no external injuries. Her cause of death was given as drowning. The inquest heard there was alcohol found in Natalies system and internal bruising was found to the left side of the front of the head. Natalie, originally of Merthyr, South Wales, had been dating Andrew for four years and the couple lived in Cardf Bay. She was an executive assistant at Travis Perkins builders yard.   Sister Janine Lloyd said in a statement: Natalie and Andrew brought out the best in each other and were as close as any couple could be. She was really at her peak before the time of her untimely death. Natalie was a light that shone so brightly it seemed impossible that it would go out. Coroner Andrew Barkley ed a narrative conclusion at the inquest in Pontypridd. He said: The evidence doesnt tell us how she got into the pool and neither does it tell us why she couldnt extract herself from the pool. Recording his conclusion, Mr Barkley said: Natalie Morris died from the effects of drowning in circumstances which are unclear. The evidence does not reveal how she entered the water.

Torquay’s  Boutique won best staycation with traditional cooked breakfast in TripAdvisor’s Travellers’ Choice awards, based on customer feedback. The five star BB, starting at pound a night, is a stone’s throw from the English Riviera setting of TV’s chaotic hotel run by Basil and Sybil Fawlty – but a million miles from Basil’s terrible service. And there’s no sarcasm about guests expecting a view of the Hanging Gardens of Babylonthey simply ask why they can’t see the sea from their room.   It’s just a five-minute walk from the Devon coast. And the trendy decor of the six-bedroom property – owned by Andy and Julian Banner-Price – includes contemporary furniture and luxurious bedrooms with rolltop baths. There’s even a zebra head called Frank, instead of the “talking” stuffed moose head dreamed up by John Cleese – and an odd-looking “superhero lamp”.   There’s freshly baked home-made goodies in rooms and jars of sweets but it is “exclusively adult – the ideal place for a relaxing and romantic stay”. Opened four years ago, the  Boutique was ninth in the global BB league last year. And taking top spot helps to see off Torquay’s Fawlty Towers image. Julian said: “We chose to call it a BB, not a hotel, because it’s just us doing everything ourselves, making everybody feel at home.   “We feel like we are welcoming people into our own home. The last Fawlty Towers was in  and it’s only in the last few years that the English Riviera has shaken that off. “The award puts us on the world stage.” The award-winning BB has bookings into September and Julian added: “It’s quite unbelievable. We are so proud that all our hard work is recognised by the world’s largest travel site.”   Torquay’s top-ranked accommodation is one of five UK BBs to make the top . Hotel winner was the Tulemar Bungalow and Villas on the Manuel Antonia coastline in Costa Rica. London’s Hotel  opposite Buckingham Palace was named the best UK hotel.

Kelley Robinson, , put on eight stone - weighing st at a size  - after giving birth to her son Kylo. She began to feel her knees buckling under the pressure of her enormous frame and even started taking diet pills. But she found that combined with working out, she could actually control her calorie intake much more effectively with the microwave meals. She now weighs a healthy st for her ft frame and is a comfy dress size , Cornwall Live reports.  Her chest and cup size also slimmed down - from a F to a more proportionate E. Kelley said: The ready meals made it so easy for me to keep track of exactly what I was consuming calorie wise. They were quick and easy too. It may not sound healthy but I chose low cal ones and it really helped me get started on my weight loss journey. It has got to the point now where people dont actually recognise me on the street. An old friend of mine did a double take the other day when I said hi as she didnt notice it was me at all. My whole outlook on le is dferent. Before all I did was sit about on the sofa and order takeaways whereas now Im super active and have tonnes of energy all the time.  Kelleywas a size  before having Kylo, now three, but after he was born she developed unhealthy eating habits. She typically had white toast for breakfast, followed by sandwich and crisps for lunch, a takeaway for dinner, while snacking on more crisps, fizzy drinks and chocolate. She piled on eight stone, but soon got fed up, and when she got desperate she tried diet pills. They were dreadful, I had no energy and couldnt stop pooing the whole time, she admitted. It was around this time that her fitness fanatic fianceacute, Ryan Lake, stepped in to help. She said: Ryan was amazing, he could see how depressed I was and just gently took control but by coaxing me to the gym. Id never have had the confidence to do it without him. At first I found it so hard, I wanted to give up, I really hated it but I kept at it and with the changes in my diet too I found that I was actually losing weight! She also started eating ready meals, which were typically between  and  calories a meal. Her favourites were Morrison’s Chicken Tikka Masala, Beef Hot Pots or Macaroni, and she started eating Weetabix and fruit for breakfast, with wraps for lunch. The new mum stopped snacking between meals and started swapping sweet drinks for water.  In the first three months of her new regime she lost a whopping three stone. Kelleysaid: It was after that when I got really strict with myself because I realised that I actually I could do it. I cut out carbs, dairy and even quit the ready meals eventually. In a year Kelley had lost NINE stone. She admitted: Im such a gym bunny now its unreal I go whenever I have a second and absolutely love it. I even get up super early before the kids wake up to go and workout for an hour. I go at least six times a week and make sure to do a mix of cardio and weights. Doing the weights have meant that the saggy skin has really toned up, which is one thing I was worried about losing quite so much. Dedicated Kelley, who is also mother to -year-old Tamzin, has noticed far more than just weight loss benefits from her new regime. Her knees are no longer a problem and her down days are well behind her. The mum-of-two said: I was quite low before as I felt so under-confident but these days I really do feel like a new person. One thing I know is that I couldnt have done it without the support of my amazing family, especially Ryan, who loved me whatever size I was but always wanted the best for me.

Her parents had tried to get in contact with the estate agent over the weekend and Shannon said she was told a plumber would finally be round on Monday. As a result of having no heating or hot water, the mother said she was forced to go round to her parents house in order to wash her sons, two-year-old Azaan and nine-month old Sahil.   She also said she was forced to sleep three in a bed for four nights, while using an electric blanket in order to stay warm, because every room in the house was freezing. Shannon said: On Friday the boiler in my house started leaking and producing a strange burning smell, before it stopped working. I immediately rang Ashton Estates to ask them to come round and fix the boiler, as I have two very young sons who I cannot keep in a freezing house, and they told me that a plumber would be round to fix it. Come pm nobody had arrived, so I began to ring the emergency number. I tried numerous times to get through but was unable and eventually the phone itself was turned off.   Over the weekend I tried to ring them again, and so did my parents, with us leaving a lot of voicemails asking them to come and fix the boiler. However nobody got back to us at all. We were then told that a plumber would be round on Monday, but still nobody showed up. Because of this I was forced to look after my children in a freezing house, and the only source of heat that we had was a broken radiator that probably isnt safe and an electric blanket. It takes the radiator about five hours to heat a room and both items use a lot of electricity. My children had to wash at my parents house. I just wanted someone to come round and fix our boiler, I have two infant sons and they shouldnt have to live like this.   A spokesperson from Ashton Estates said a plumber visited the property on Tuesday and managed to get the boiler working again but said the reason it had not been working was due to no gas being on the meter, a claim refuted by Shannon. Ashton Estates said: Our plumbers are very busy but managed to get round earlier today and the gas is now back on. We found the issue to be that there was no gas on the meter, although the plumber did not actually look at the meter itself. They have said that a notication on the boiler indicated to them that there was no gas. Shannon said she did have gas in the meter for the whole weekend, and that the plumber had told her that there was an issue with steam in the boiler and that was what caused it to break.

Mrs Pinhorne said she believed the flowers could have been a Valentines Day gt from a former boyfriend, while the diary had gone missing from her home months earlier. Despite telling investigators she knew nothing about the dumping of either of the items in Andover, Hants, they refused to believe her.   Speaking after the court case, she said: I knew I had not done this, I clearly told them I had lost the diary but I was threatened with being arrested. Everything I have said has been true, so I brought it to crown court because it felt like I was being set up. None of the rubbish there was mine, I hadnt dumped it, and they went for me anyway. I have been spoken to really rudely, I actually had to request one of the investigators stop contacting me because of they way he spoke to me. Because they found my old diary, my personal le has been dragged through the court as well - diary entries about personal things were read out. That diary, which had my name inside it, went missing from my home months before it was found. The flowers they found with the diary were in a yellow carrier bag and there was an envelope with my name on in there as well.  They must have been a Valentines Day present, possibly from a former boyfriend, but I never received them. I am very pleased to have won, but the council have just spent at least pound, on the cost of bringing this case. They will now have to pay my costs as well so I would estimate it could go up to pound, - thats taxpayers money. I hope the council learns a lesson from this, this was a waste of taxpayers money. Mrs Pinhorne, of Picket Piece near Andover, denied one count of fly tipping. A spokeswoman for Test Valley Borough Council said: We took this to court following a thorough and comprehensive investigation and external counsel advice confirming that there was a case to answer. Although we are naturally disappointed with the result we, of course, respect the courts decision.  We are extremely proud of our record in tackling fly-tipping having been successful in securing a prosecution in  out of  cases since the start of . The cost to the taxpayer of clearing up fly-tips and impact on communities is signicant. That is why it is important the council continues to seek to prosecute those we believe have fly-tipped in order to discourage people from illegally dumping their waste in our beautul borough.

Scotland Yard continues to tackle the horric kne crime epidemic which plagued London, and other large cities, in . And in just two weeks, the force has seized a shocking number of weapons - including a machete and a hunting kne. It has tweeted almost  pictures of the confiscated knives, used in robberies, left in bushes and gathered in stop and searches. One terrying image, shared by the politan Police, shows a crook’s attempt to conceal a razor-sharp kne in a plastic shopping bag. Officers also discovered a discarded weapon lying by a walkway on an estate in Tottenham, north London.  Meanwhile, a machete, at least  inches long, was recovered following a moped chase in Catford, southeast London. Other large blades were seized from children as young as  over a two-week period. In one incident in Camden, north London, three knives were taken from the same thug after he decided to use a meat cleaver as a weapon.  And a sickening picture tweeted by police in Islington shows a -inch sword a suspect was allegedly carrying along with several bags of cannabis. Affluent areas like Notting Hill and Highgate - home to celebrities including Kate Moss and Jude Law - arent free from those who choose to carry blades either. One was unearthed on a Highgate street, while officers attending a disturbance in upper-class Notting Hill allegedly took a kitchen kne, baseball bat and a rolling pin from a group of three men.  And according to Kensington and Cha Police’s Twitter account, a Batman-shaped knuckle duster was discovered on an estate during a stop and search for driving offences. Last year was one of the worst in recent years for murders in London. Figures show the number of people killed hit a -year high with more than a fth of victims teenagers or children. The  homicides recorded by the politan Police included  where the victims were aged  or under. Of those,  were stabbed, five were shot and one woman was killed by a head injury. It was London’s highest homicide total since , which saw  people killed, and a  per cent rise year-on-year. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had recently named street violence as her number one priority and acknowledged that  was challenging.  Kne crime campaigners have welcomed the ongoing work to remove weapons and praised police for putting the images on their Twitter accounts. Patrick Green, of the charity Ben Kinsella Trust, said: It’s really important to take knives off the streets. Some of the work the politan Police have been doing extends beyond stop and search - we know that they are now doing sweeps of parks and public areas. That’s really an important piece of work for us because we know that habitual kne carriers who are fearful of being stopped will place knives in locations so they can go to that location and retrieve them so the work being done by the police there is really welcomed. We have also seen that they are doing a lot of those searches in conjunction with members of the public or community groups so there is a sense of helping other members of the community support to them in their work.  That’s good because local people have a lot of intelligence about where things might be hidden. Targeted use of stop and search done in an intelligence led way we are happy with - it’s an important police tactic. We are really pleased to see the police take a proactive stance however as good as the measures the police take are, they will not on their own solve the kne crime problem. Part of the issue we have got to address is the step before someone carries a kne. Preventative work and early intervention is as important as everything the police do. Dr Mark Prince runs the The Kiyan Prince Foundation, which works with young people to end violence. His son Kiyan, , was stabbed to death on May , , receiving a single lethal kne wound as he intervened to stop the bullying of another teen.   Dr Prince said: Work like this does make a dference because every area has to be responsible for the part that they play and for enforcing the law. You could have been on the way to using that kne and because you’ve been caught you’ve saved a le, so there is sense behind the enforcement and we need that. It’s collective - everybody needs to be doing their part. MP Stephen Timms, who was stabbed at one of his constituency surgeries in May , added: I’m pleased the Met is putting so much emphasis on confiscating knives. But we also need to stop people getting them in the first place. That means tackling the online s which supply them.

John Manley, , is nowbeing treatedfor mental health issues after allegedly ploughing the construction vehicle into a newly built Travelodge branch of the budget hotel over unpaid wages. Footage of the incident, which left the hotel front in Edge Lane destroyed, went viral after being filmed by other workers on the site. The rampage appeared to have been triggered after Mr Manleys pound wages were allegedly not paid on time by sub-contracting firm MF Constructions. Yesterday his cousin, Jason Pellegrini, , revealed Mr Manley had been seeking mental health treatment for a number of weeks.Today, his cousin reiterated that rumours circulating claiming the driver had actually been paid but had not checked his bank balance were .  In a new statement to the Liverpool Echo, Mr Pellegrini said: I would just like to stress what I stated in my local paper and clear something up.John Manley did not get paid on Monday, I know this as he does not have a bank account as he did not have the necessary identication, his wages, when paid, go into a family members account. This was checked on Monday and there was pound donated by a friend.If, as has been reported, there was an alleged glitch in the system, why would the boss refuse to answer any calls or messages which John left   Should he not explain this to his workers who break their back in a physically demanding job and just want a honest wage  We would like to highlight the fact again we do not condone Johns actions for the simple fact someone could have been seriously injured or worse pay disputes can be handled in dferent ways. Potentiallythe unions had more power it could be resolved that way, however I doubt that will happen whilst we have the muppets in charge of our country. His cousin yesterday said the huge strain on mental health services in the local area meant Mr Manley failed to receive adequate help.  Mr Pellegrini said: Hes had a very, very bad le. Hes not an angel we dont want to portray him as an angel... We have been trying to get him help but theres such a long waiting list. Its not down to the health care professionals but its a lack of resources. We are not condoning what he did at all someone could have been seriously hurt and hes not a national hero like some people have been making out. He is very troubled and its something when he has had to do what he did to get the kind of help he needs. He told me he does not want any money, he just wants his mates to get paid and he wants to get well.  He added that Mr Manley had traumatic childhood and only worked sporadically. It was claimed that Mr Manley was sleeping on a relatives couch inMerseyside in the lead up to the incident and was desperate after his employer MF Construction, allegedly failed to pay his pound wages. Mr Pellegrini said: He would ring the GP at am when it opens, and there would already be  people in the waiting line for an appointment. We wanted to get him a to a psychiatrist in Crosby but the waiting list is so long. I know he was technically of no fixed abode and could not claim benefits, so when he didnt work he literally had nothing. He had no money for gas, electric or food. According to Mr Pellegrinis account, neither his boss or his employer would answer the phone. I think in the end he just snapped. He said to me he would not have done ithed had an explanation.  Triton Construction, the main contractor for the Travelodge site, revealed there was no structural damage to the site. Michael Parkinson, managing director of Triton, said: It is our understanding that one of the labourers working for MF Construction, who were employed as the groundworks contractor for the project, had been waiting for his boss to arrive with his wages, which he told other workers on site were overdue. It is alleged that the labourer couldn’t track down the owner of MF Construction and he became increasingly frustrated. At approximately .pm the labourer took it upon himself to drive a small mini excavator through the entrance screen of the hotel and subsequently caused damage to finishes within the reception. The labourer then ran from the scene and to our knowledge is being pursued by the police. Fortunately there appears to be no structural damage so repairs can be undertaken relatively quickly. “ Merseyside Police confirmed they located a man as part of the investigation into the incident, but stated he is not under arrest.

A survey polling , adults revealed we splurge thousands of pounds each year – on things which mostly go untouched – including food, beauty products and phone contracts. During a typical year, we’ll blow pound, on food and drinks - including takeaway meals, bottled water or items left in the fridge or cupboards. We’ll also spend pound on clothes which remain in the wardrobe untouched over the same period – pound will go on unused beauty products and pound on toiletries.   And on top of that pound will be wasted on TV packages they rarely or never watch, while pound will go on unused mobile phone credit.

The Lottoland research carried out through OnePoll found we also tend to waste pound on CDs, DVDs and vinyl - perhaps due to the advent of smaller, more portable devices and streaming software. Entertainment-centric Brits said they spend approximately pound on gaming a year – buying the latest computer games or consoles.

Hannah Taylor grew up with “scary” stories about childbirth from her own mum and wanted a serene experience for her son Koa. The -year-old yoga teacher decided the best option for her and her son - now aged three months - was a freebirth without a medical attendant or professional present. Hannah and her partner Tyler Couchman welcomed lb oz baby Koa in an outdoor bath with no-one telling her to push, describing it as an incredible, blissful, experience. Just Tyler and best friend Shea Zamarra were in attendance. Hannah, from the US city of Sacramento, Calornia, said: “My mum had traumatic births with me and my sister and it didn’t sit well with me. “Growing up I had only heard scary stories of birth and when I heard about my friend’s experience with unassisted birth. It felt right to me.  “A unassisted birth is one without medical intervention. You give birth unhindered and without medical interference.“No one telling you when to push, you just completely listen to your own body. “During my pregnancy I did a lot of research and I read a lot of books. I listened to podcasts focused on women and their unassisted birthing stories.  She added: “I went into labour in early morning at about am on October  and my active contractions started around .am. “I was just home with my partner and my best friend Shea. I hadn’t planned to move to the outside to the tub, I just wanted to use it as somewhere to take a break during labour. “I was on the floor of my room when I decided to move outside to the tub. It is connected to the warm water mains from our house.  “It was an incredible, blissful, experience and I was ecstatic. Meeting my little boy for the first time was incredible.” Hannah and her sister, Jessica Taylor, were born by Caesarean section which left her keen to explore other options during her own pregnancy. Unassisted birth is the process of having a baby without the presence of a medical attendant or professional, which Hannah believed was the best option for her family. Hannahs partner Tyler, , a chef, added: So far it was the most amazing experience of my le. I had never heard of free birth before, but catching my son in my arms was the most amazing thing. Holding him brought tears to my eyes. It felt like a dream.  While Hannah’s birth was unassisted, the mum did attend regular prenatal appointments with a midwe to make sure her pregnancy was healthy. Hannah said she would have rethought her plans had there been a health issue or potential danger for Koa. She said: “I had a healthy pregnancy and I visited a midwe all along. I had prenatal care. “There was no sign that anything was wrong, andthere had been I would have had to think about changing my plan.  “Depending on the severity I would have had to consider a hospital birth in that case. But I really made sure I had done a lot of research. Hannah has described her first three months as a mom to be “blissful” and she will always feel blessed to have had such a serene birthing experience. Tyler said the couple feel lucky that their friend was there to capture the moment on camera.  He added: Its really special that we have those pictures. They captured the moment so perfectly. Hannah said: “The sun was out and it was beautul. I felt extremely powerful. “A few days afterwards he was checked out and everything was great. “I think all people should follow their hearts. I did what I thought was the best thing for my baby. “An unhindered birth allowed the experience to be sacred and it was incredible. I have never felt so connected to my body. I felt very blessed. “He’s so wonderful.

Those who chose breast milk can be faced with several issues - especiallythey struggle to produce their own. Thankfully the internet has a solution for this. For years generous women have been offering up their spare breast milk for babies in need via social media and websites. But while this act of kindness may bring about joy, it can sometimes also be a bit bizarre. One unnamed woman recently saw the darker side of her charitable actions, after a mum contacted her to ask for some of her milk.  The conversation between the two began civilly, as the mum messaged the woman to askshe could donate some milk to her. In screen shots of their chat shared on Imgur, we can see that the woman is more than willing to give away her milk, she responds asking how old the little one is and asks how much she requires. The mum reveals that her son is almost two-years-old and eats a lot. She subsequently offers to take it all off the womans hands.  The woman, who has her own six-week-old daughter, says she can spare about  ounces of milk for her fellow parent. I can spare about  ounces todayyou can pick up. My girl is only six weeks old so Im reserving most of the milk for a baby her age or any preemies in need in the Facebook group. However the other mum isnt impressed by her offer and asks for more. She replied: Lol... ounces  He eats like almost  a day. Thats only like  days worth. [Friends name] said you make tonnes of milk so I was hoping you could give a bit more. Hes got a sensitive stomach and breast milk is one of the few things his little tummy can handle.  He was a preemie too. The woman remains levelheaded with her reply and kindly tells the mum shell see how much she has left over after the rest has been claimed as shes donating with the intention of helping out an infant preemie. Her answer adds fuel to the fire and outraged the mum sends off another message. It reads: Dont understand why you cant just give it to me  Why does it have to be a preemie My boy was a preemie and he is a baby in need.   The woman stands her ground, reminding the mum that her son is no longer a baby and doesnt actually need any breast milk. No offence but your kid is a toddler, not a baby who needs exclusive breast milk. Ive offered you what I can spare already and am happy to see how much I have left over after donating the majority this weekend, she said. Im happy to send you a message to let you know. Realising shes not going to get what she wants, the mum decides to turn nasty and lashes out. The conversation ends with her writing: Whatever b****, keep your sour milk. Its probably tainted with booze and painkillers. Feel sorry for whichever poor kid ends up with it.

The -year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described the brutal attack as the trial of the men opened. Her -year-old mum was attacked on the last night of their holiday in the Italian seaside resort of Meta di Sorrento, south of Naples, when her drink was allegedly spiked. The court heard how the gang of workers were caught by cops after sharing sick videos of the attack on an online chat group.  She was on holiday with her daughter and was so shocked she didnt tell cops what happened until she ed home to the UK. Her daughter broke down in tears as she told the court in nearby Torre Annunziata: My mum seemed distant and far away.She broke down in tears at the airport as we were leaving and told me everything that happened. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and shared a bottle of wine. We were with another couple of holidaymakers.  The staff at the restaurant were very polite. Then one of the barmen offered my mother and I drink in some shot glasses. One of them had a tattoo on his neck. They invited us to the bar for a drink after we finished our dinner. I remember having a drink and then almost immediately feeling sick.I went to the toilet and threw up. I was there for a while and when I came back my mum had disappeared. Prosecutors say the victim was taken to a room close to the swimming pool where she was raped several times by the men before stumbling back to her room at the Hotel Alimuri.  The woman reported the attack to cops when she ed to the UK, and DNA samples and drug tests were sent to Italian investigators. They revealed a high level of the sedative benzodiazepines but lawyers for the five defendants claim the victim was on tranquillisers following the death of her husband. But her daughter told the court: My mum has never taken any medicine like that. Antonino Miniero, Gennaro Davide Gargiulo, Raffaele Regio, Francesco Ciro DAntonio, Fabio De Virgilio, all deny rape.

One bathing house in the town was even built exclusively for Joseph Stalin. But after the USSR collapsed in the early s, the stream of socialist visitors started to dry up and the once grand buildings were left to be reclaimed by time and nature.  Eerie images taken by photographer Roman Robroek show deserted arcades with columns topped by crumbling turquoise arches - that open onto balconies with views of the woods beyond.And wide stone staircases spiral down to the now empty bathing pools, where the ceramic tiles barely cling to the walls. Nara Dreamland, Japan Fascinating images recently captured the inside of an abandoned and overground theme park in Japan which was once expected to rival Disneyland. Nara Dreamland was built in , complete with fairytale castles, rollercoasters and other attractions. But the park struggled to compete when both Disney and Universal Studios opened up their own parts in nearby Osaka and Tokyo. The park was eventually closed in the summer of , but its attractions were left in place for over  years to rust and decay.  Photos revealed eerily quiet walkways, rollercoaster tracks choked by wild overgrowth, paint peeling off shabby attractions and twisted, rust metal where majestic water fountains once stood. After it closed it became a popular place for ‘haikyoists’ - a Japanese word meaning urban explorers, particularly those interested in ruined structures and landscapes. Houtouwan, China  Built on the steep hills of Shengshan Island, , fishermen once plied their trade in the village of Houtouwan in China. But thousands of inhabitants moved from the island, one of  islands on the Shengsi archipelago, in the early s, seeking better education, jobs and healthcare. They left only a small handful of residents still living there, and today even that group has dwindled to almost nobody.  Last year stunning pictures emerged from the village showing how it is being reclaimed by nature. Empty homes and other buildings in the once bustling community are now covered in green with some almost disappearing into the hills. Pripyat, Ukraine After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in  tens of thousands were evacuated from neighbouring Pripyat, a city of ,. Fteen primary schools, a large hospital complex,  stores,  gyms, along with parks, cinemas, factories, pool, amusement park, and other marks of a thriving community. And it was all abandoned in just three hours when residents were told to leave.  Over three decades later, the ghost town is a freeze-frame of the Soviet Union in . Communist propaganda still hangs on walls, the hammer and sickle decorate lampposts awaiting May Day celebrations that never took place, and residents’ personal belongings litter the streets and abandoned buildings.  All clocks are frozen at :, the moment the electricity was cut. The place is also overrun with wild animals, while the only humans who visit are urban explorers who pay to go on guided tours to some of the city’s abandoned structures, including people’s flats and a fairground complete with ferris wheel which never opened. Cold war bunker, Dundee During the Cold War, underground monitoring stations were manned by members of the Royal Observer Corpsand one of their main purposes was to give the dreaded “four minute warning” in the case of a nuclear attack. But after the Soviet Union fell in  the bunkers were sealed shut or demolished.One near Dundee, however, was preserved exactly how it was when it was last entered at least  years ago.  Explorers who recently entered the secret site for the first time found old pots and pans, mugs, and washing up liquid alongside official Cold War communications technology. The bunker, built ft under the ground, and housed two people when it was operational, still has the original desk, cabinets and bunk beds that would have been used by volunteers. Blankets were filmed rotting on the bunk bed exactly where they had been left decades ago, and there is even a candle holder with the remains of a burned-out candle stuck in the base. Ferrybridge Power Station, Wakefield Millions of people who travel up the M motorway in West Yorkshire will be familiar with Ferrybridge power station’s huge towers. But few except the men and women who once worked there have ever seen inside one of Britain’s tallest buildings. The giant towers have been abandoned since March  when the film that owns Ferrybridge closed up shop, has now applied for permission from Wakefield Council to knock it down. Photographer Paul Crumpton managed to get inside the huge structure, taking impressive pictures of the machinery and once-bustling control rooms which now lie stationary and abandoned. He found vast control , workspaces and equipment as well as dusty and rusting pipes, tanks and turbines.

They were seen with the toothy beast loaded in the back of a boat, which was being carried on a truck, to Cecil Park, in the west of the city, on Sunday.

The shark was enormous and just physically too big to fit into the car door. The clip was uploaded to the TeamBaitcatcher Facebook page and received mixed comments. One praised their work, saying: Absolute Legends and the Mako actually looked like he was enjoying the ride.   While another was more concerned about the shark, adding: Nice fish and well done but why be a bunch of flogs and hang it out the back of the boat. The fishermen confirmed they would cut up and share out the meat to their four familes.

We didn’t start the game well,” said Jim.“These cup games are always dficult. Just look at the results around the other clubs and there’s been a few shocks.“I’m just glad that we’re still in the cup and we have another chance to recty that performance. We all know it was short of what we’re looking for.”If he was unhappy with his team’s work, the manager did stress the quality Queens showed did not surprise him.“You’ve got to credit Queen of the South. Give them a bit of credit, they played well.“You know what it’s like when a Championship or lower team comes to a Premiership club. You know they are going to be right up for the game and you know you are going to be in a fight.“They beat Ross County - last week which was a fabulous result against a team who’ve just knocked Motherwell out.”On top of getting another chance, Jim was pleased with the debuts he handed to Dieng, Craig Curran and second-half subs Andy Dales and Andrew Nelson.“The positives for me were the introduction of the newer players who all contributed and there will be better days ahead for us.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c42106f2ca675.54965825-e1547845700567.jpg ","title":"jim mclean saddened by the waygoing of tannadice legends","story":"It’s always sad when a football legend moves on from a club.However, that is the nature of the game, and spaces have to be freed up for new talent brought in or coming through.I can remember a couple of Dundee United-supporting friends being upset when Andy Rolland left the club.They felt, at that time, he could still do a good job for the team.Signed from Cowdenbeath in , Rolland, nicknamed “The Galloping Major”, would stay for  years at Tannadice.United wanted him to stay on but the player had an offer from American club Fort Lauderdale Strikers.Given his tremendous service in playing well over  games for the Terrors, the club immediately granted him a free transfer in September .He said at the time: “This offer has come right out of the blue.“Fort Lauderdale phoned me on Thursday, wanted me to travel on Saturday, and then play my first game for them on Sunday.“But that was too rushed for me.“I expect to go sometime next week.”He continued: “It’s a great offer, and I had to accept.“However, it’s a wrench leaving United after all these years.“Fort Lauderdale have offered me a -month all-year contract, but I’d rather come home when the main season finishes.”Tannadice manager Jim McLean was sorry to see his full-back go.“We will miss him – off the field as well as on it,” he said.“Since I’ve come into Tannadice, we have now lost three great long-serving players – Dennis Gillespie and Doug Smith being the others.“All of them were outstanding club men, and great examples for our young players.”The Dundee United directors also showed their appreciation of his loyalty by making a special payment to him in lieu of a benefit.On ing from America, where he also turned out for Los Angeles Aztecs, Rolland spent two years with Harry Melrose’s Dunfermline, before ending his playing career back at Cowdenbeath.He also managed the Central Park side for a spell."},{"url":null,"title":"no excuses from nathan ralph for dundees poor cup display","story":"If excuses were his thing, full-back Nathan Ralph wouldn’t be short of a few to explain Dundee’s below-par display as they were held at home by second-tier Queen of the South in the Scottish Cup on Saturday.After the three-week winter break, the Dark Blues were not alone in looking rusty as they faced up to the Doonhamers at Dens Park.Elsewhere, as other Premiership outfits got back to competitive action for the first time since the turn of the year, the fourth round saw Motherwell crash out at home to Ross County and Aberdeen held by minnows Stenhousemuir.Dundee were also facing a team that has been in fine form of late and who, in veteran Stephen Dobbie, can boast one of the best strikers in the country, not just the Championship.That they came to Dens and turned in a high level of performance should have come as no surprise.Last, and certainly not least, what turned out to be the first leg of this tricky tie saw Dundee hand debuts to no fewer than four players in the shape of goalkeeper Seny Dieng and attackers Craig Curran, Andy Dales and Andrew Nelson.With so many new faces involved, it was perhaps understandable the home team’s play at times lacked cohesion, though ironically at the weekend it was generally speaking the new players who were the pick of the bunch.That’s all the get-outs listed and Ralph isn’t too interested in any of them. For him, the bottom line is Dundee should have been better than this.“It was very frustrating on Saturday. I think our performance first half, we should be thankful we are still in the cup really,” he said.“It wasn’t good enough. They’ve got the goal to go ahead and then Jesse has done brilliantly just before half-time to get it back and have us level.“It was a good time for us to score and then we did definitely play better in the second half. On the whole, though, it was not good enough.“I suppose it does happen in the cup, we saw that with some of the other results, and the big thing is we are still in there and have a replay where we can make it into the next round.“So we maybe shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves over it but we’re still not happy with the performance.”Like most players after a bad game, now the -year-old just wants to get out on a pitch again and try to put things right.That’s why he breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday when Hearts’ televised clash with Livingston produced a result.Had the Jambos not edged past the Lions, a replay would have been tonight and Dundee’s Premiership visit to Tynecastle would have been postponed.“We have another game right away and that’s good. The one thing we didn’t want was no game this week because Hearts had drawn their cup-tie.“The thing you want to do after the winter break is get back into playing regularly again right away and you don’t want to be missing games because of things like that. You want to get points on the board as soon as possible.”Turning to the subject of the new arrivals, Ralph believes they will signicantly boost the chances of top-flight survival.So far, he’s been impressed by what he’s seen.He added: “I thought the new lads looked sharp and direct. They definitely want to get on the ball, create and make things happen.“I think them coming in this month will be good for the squad and they are going to help us going forward.”"},{"url":null,"title":"one in and one out for dundee united as goalkeeper signs from hibs","story":"Dundee United have signed goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw on loan from Hibs as Matej Rakovan departs the club.The Tangerines have sealed a loan deal until the end of the season for the -year-old after releasing Slovakian goalie Rakovan with  months remaining on his contract.Laidlaw has played  times for the Hibees, winning the Championship in  in the process, and will challenge with Benjamin Siegrist for the gloves at Tannadice.Manager Robbie Neilson said: “Ross joins us to compete for the first-team goalkeeping position.#He brings important experience having won this championship with Hibs and most importantly is an excellent goalkeeper.#I have been looking to improve the competition within the goalkeeping set-up, and I am happy to see Ross here.“Rakovan played  times for the Tangerines, keeping one clean sheet."},{"url":null,"title":"readers panel tell us what you think of the tele and you can win 50","story":"The Eveningwants to know what YOU think – and you could even receive a cash reward.Join the Tele’s Reader Panel – a sounding board of trusted readers – to let us know, through short and simple online surveys, what you think of our content.All the answers are vital to us, helping us to provide the kind of paper you want to read.What’s more, for each survey you complete you will be entered into a free monthly prize draw, with three lucky lists each winning £.It really is that simple.Tele editor Dave Lord said he wanted to hear from readers, however they consume the news – be it a copy of the newspaper or online through your mobile or tablet.“This is the perfect opportunity for you, as a reader of the Tele, to tell us what you think and have your say on our future,” he continued.“Please be assured that input from readers is crucial in shaping our content, from news and sport to features.

It gave everyone with a liking for the Tangerines a lt.So, too, did a dramatic shrinking of the seven-point gap at the top of the Championship courtesy of Neilson’s team taking four points from consecutive home games, while top two Ross County and Ayr United each lost two in a row.That means, for a few hours at least, United can join leaders County on the -point markthey win the second tier’s game of the weekend at Ayr on Friday night.They would, of course, still trail the Staggies, who have a vastly superior goal dference, but just being up there would be another boost.A win would also cancel out the game in hand Ayr hold over United, though they too have a better goal dference. And whatever happens at Somerset Park, Ian McCall’s team will be above themthey beat Inverness next midweek.Perhaps, though, the biggest benefit to United this weekend can be the type of performance that, whatever the points, makes a statement that they’re the ones to beat. That, unfortunately, is something they’ve largely failed to do in three seasons down in the Championship.Past glories, some of them recent, mean United start every campaign as favourites for promotion.And any team walking into Tannadice on a Saturday sees a club geared for football in the Premiership.Too often, however, any edge that’s given United has disappeared because of performances.Even when they’ve lost, in the last two-and-a-half years sides have come out of games against them feeling reputation and expectation have not matched the sum of the parts of the team they’ve faced.Results like two defeats away to Dumbarton the season before last, a - loss at Falkirk last term and two five-goal home losses in this campaign, have led to opposition throughout the ision believing they always have a chance when facing United.In truth, even the draw with Partick Thistle this month and the win over Dunfermline that closed the gap at the top to those three points, were not as convincing as was expected.That’s repeatedly been the case during the two failed attempts to get up. In the big games, too often United have come up short.They did beat Hibs at Tannadice near the end of  but lost heavily to them soon after and quickly dropped off the pace at the top.Andthey won twice at Tannadice against last season’s table toppers St Mirren, the first time came before the Buddies were regarded as their main rivals and the second after Jack Ross’s team were out of sight at the top.This time round, the best so far came up in Dingwall in November when County were beaten -.Without taking anything away from that success, after Paul Watson’s early goal put them ahead, the three points were secured via a gritty rearguard action.Yes, it was the kind of performance that is needed at times in a successful league campaign.So, too, do emphatic victories that tell the rest of the league you are a team to be feared. There would be no better time for such a statement than Friday in Ayrshire."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-subway-incident-at-west-street-mean-services-suspended","story":"UPDATE:Man dead after being hit by train on Glasgow Subway during rush-hour.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13896898.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171494552.jpg","title":"coventry city signing michael rose","story":"NewsCoventry City signing Michael Rose can be future Scotland star, says Ayr United boss Ian McCallThe Ayr United centre half has completed a pre contract switch to the Ricoh Arena and will join the Sky Blues in the summer.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMichael Rose, left, in action for Ayr United \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall reckons Coventry have bagged themselves a future Scotland star in Michael Rose.

Everyone talks about Lawrence but, in my opinion, Michael Rose could go on to achieve just as much -not more -he wants to.  He is that good a player and Ive no doubt he can be a future Scotland international. For my money hes been the best centre half in the Championship this season. Of course wed have loved to keep him, but we have to be realistic. Rose is one of a number of players to reinvent their careers under McCall following his failure to break through as a youth at Aberdeen. And McCall said: It is further proof to boys thatthey come here and develop themselves, they will get their reward. Michael is an outstanding player with a very bright future and we wish him all the best.

And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to. My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive. She said: “If I want the children to be fit and healthy then I have to model that. “Health and wellbeing has to underpin everything we’re doing. “The local junor parkrun is an example of something I’d like to see encouraged. “We’ve also rolled out more than  after-school and lunch clubs from this month. “I’ll be doing a homework club and the clerical team are doing a running club so we’re all very hands on. “But ultimately the children are my inspiration. “We have a fantastic new building in which to work and I’ve never experienced anything like it during my career. “Now the challenge is to make the most of it and enjoy what we have.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new super school riddled structural","story":"NewsNew super-school is riddled with structural problemsLeaks, faulty automatic doors and sensory lights are among a string of issues at Invergarven’s marquee campus in Girvan.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsInside the school \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new pound million super-school is “riddled” with structural problems, it can been revealed.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"communities-chance-to-take-charge-of-their-local-halls-and-centres","story":"East Lothian Council has identied six community buildings which it believes could be run by local residents.It says the move would be carried out as part of its Community Asset Transferproject, which is looking for new ways to run some of its facilities, including handing them to local groups to run or take over ownership.Six potentially suitable buildings will be offered to communities this month, with a three-month deadline for local groups to submit notes of interest.They are: East Linton Council Chamber, Gullane Recreation Hall, Macmerry Village Hall, Prestonpans Town Hall, Stoneyhill Community Centre in Musselburgh, and Trevelyan Hall in Pencaitland.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoThere are a number of community facilities and village halls in East Lothian which are already managed successfully by volunteer members of the local community.ldquoCommittees often cover running costs through the income they receive, with a ied programme of events taking place at the heart of the local community.ldquoWe believe that giving communities the opportunity to take an enhanced role has the potential to increase the usage and vibrancy of the facilities and also increase income to help cover running costs.And he added: ldquoCommunity organisations may be able to access external funding sources to help make the venues increasingly successful.The council will be engaging with local groups and inviting interested parties to get in touch as it looks for ways to transfer the buildings back to the communities.It has already held meetings with community councils and area partnerships.Mr Goodfellow said: ldquoThis supports the council in making increasingly efficient use of resources.ldquoIt enables us to continue working in partnership with local communities towards realising our vision for an even more prosperous, safe and sustainable East Lothian.Recommendations for the future of the buildings will be made following the end of the consultation period."},{"url":null,"title":"were-sorry-scotrail-offers-compensation-for-unacceptable-service-on-north-berwick-line","story":"The Haymarket to North Berwick line is one of those whose season ticket holders qualy for the special compensation as a result of it being one of the worst affected by recent train crew shortages.As an apology, ScotRail is offering season ticket holders free travel on six specied weekends in the spring.There is no need for season ticket holders to apply for the offer.A statement on ScotRails website from Alex Hynes, managing director of ScotRail Alliance, said: \"We are very sorry to ScotRail customers for our unacceptable service in parts of the country recently.\"While our teams work hard every day to deliver the service you demand, the reality is that wersquove fallen below the standard you expect and deserve.\"While it doesnrsquot excuse what has happened, here are the challenges we have faced:\"We are working flat out to train conductors and drivers on Scotlandrsquos railway so that we canservices to normal.\"Since December  we have trained  drivers and conductors, so we have made progress, but we know we need to do more.\"We are training more than  drivers and conductors every day throughout January and February toyour service to levels you deserve.\"We have seen the level of cancellations reduce steadily over the last few weeks.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-a-play-a-pie-and-a-pint-15-years-and-500-plays","story":"Chamberlain is auditioning later on, and she has  plays to cast. The first of those, a bite-size version of Liz Lochheadrsquos rambunctious Scots version of Molierersquos comedy, Tartuffe, opens in early February.

As well as it being the initiativersquos fteenth year of operation over thirty seasons, this year will also feature the th play to be produced by A Play, A Pie and A Pint.To celebrate, while the focus of PPP remains on showcasing brand new bite-size dramas, twelve of the forthcoming seasonrsquos productions will form what amounts to a greatest hits set. This shows the range of material which has made its way onto Oran Morrsquos stage in a low-budget, low-risk way light-years away from a prevailing corporate philosophy of big-budget event-based shows.This includes revisiting the debut plays by David Ireland and Denise Mina, as well as favourite shows about comedian Chic Murray, Dusty Springfield and Fe-born darts player, Jocky Wilson. Irelandrsquos play, What The Animals Say, heralded a career which has seen one of his most recent plays, Cyprus Avenue, win numerous awards, while his Traverse Theatre hit, Ulster American, is about to tour to Australia and Ireland. Also revived is Aye, Elvis, Morna Youngrsquos comedy about a female Elvis Presley impersonator.ldquoAfter  years it seems like the right moment to look back, and to celebrate, says Chamberlain.As Fullarton points out, it is also an opportunity to revisit pieces which have all but disappeared from view.ldquoOne of the things about the shows at A Play, A Pie and A Pint is that theyrsquore only on for a week, she says, ldquoso unless the writers and directors can get producers and other theatres interested, they disappear, and there are some cracking plays which deserve the chance of a wider audience, or to be expanded.

Lest there be any accusations of nepotism, the choice of what plays should be seen again was put to a vote involving Oran Mor regulars, with Casablanca coming out on top.Read More: David MacLennan on his lunchtime dreamldquoWersquore being guided quite a lot by the regular PPP audience, says Chamberlain, ldquoand one of the things wersquove tried to do since we started here is to widen the pool of writers involved. Wersquore putting so much on now that we can maybe afford to get a writer to do another draft of a playitrsquos not quite ready, and we can put that on a bit later.Chamberlain and Fullarton have been at the helm of A Play, A Pie and A Pint since , taking over from producer Susannah Armitage, who had overseen the organisation since MacLennanrsquos passing in . Both come with swathes of experience in theatre and television, with Fullarton combining both in the early s with a TV version of her stage production of Dario Forsquos play, Mistero Buffo, which starred Robbie Coltrane. Chamberlain, meanwhile, co-founded production company The Comedy Unit, responsible for numerous much-loved TV sit-coms.While things have become more streamlined in terms of the day to day running of the company since the early days of PPP, all those involved since have nevertheless retained the sense of low-risk immediacy which MacLennan championed, and despite receiving Creative Scotland funding in a way it might have previously steered clear of, remains a small operation.ldquoOne of the great joys of A Play, A Pie and A Pint for the writers, says Fullarton, ldquois that your play can be on in three months, and it doesnrsquot have to hang around for a year waiting for lots of executive producers to make decisions.

What then is the point of these debates apart from massaging already-inflated egos and ensuring continued employment for those responsible for Hansard  Perhaps these debates could be enlivened by the abolition of vote whipping, with every vote being a free vote to restore the uncertainty inherent in true debating  Certainly a debate on that proposal would at least be interesting.Alan Fitzpatrick, Solomonrsquos View, Dunlop.I READ Richard Mowbrays contribution to the correspondence on the European Unionand was struck by the constant deception which has been practised by those in power and their pandering acolytes for decades. The  information broadcast by the Brexiters was by no means a one-off occurrence.In  we were told that we were joining a trading group called the EEC and to a greater extent that is exactly what it was. Unfortunately, those in power in the UK whether blue or red did not see Europe as a positive. It became common policy to blame any unpopular action they took on the European Union. In this they were aided and abetted by the red tops and Little Englander press which enthusiastically printed their nonsense and made up their own as well . This swelled the ranks of voters who blindly blamed Europe for any perceived disadvantage they experienced. The logical result of this was the rise of racism and anti-Semitism.Westminster had no interest in working to mould the EU and was seen as a disruptive element standing on the outside throwing insults. The constant bitching about how much our contribution was masked the real net amount which our membership actually cost. The thing Westminster politicians hated was that money paid was ed as grants not to the south-east of England but to rural and regional areas, in which as we all know Westminster has very little interest.The cynical use of misinformation continued through the  Independence referendum and on to the European referendum. It continues today with Theresa May and Liam Fox making absurd statements about the ease of trade deals, nf which obviously Mr Mowbray has also been duped. Perhaps we should all bear in mind that there were no politicians riding into the valley of death with the Light Brigade.David Stubley, Templeton Crescent, Prestwick.A PEOPLES Vote is a way out of the Brexit impasse, but onlyit is held under dferent rules from those under which the original vote took place. These rules are fine for General Elections which can be re-run in five years. A referendum is dferent and as such should operate under dferent rules ndash rules which must provide a clear answer.Before a Peoples Vote we must set these rules ndash perhaps a   vote in favour, for example. Otherwise this impasse could go on interminably.L McDermott, Fairfield Place, Glasgow.OH dear, plan B is just plan A minus a few days .Dave Biggart,Southcroft, Knockbuckle Road, Kilmacolm.CAN the Windrush applicants get their fees back too John Hein, Montgomery Street, Edinburgh.I HAVE just received my personal tax summary for  . On the back page there is a breakdown of how the tax I paid contributed to public spending in the tax year. It is not something I have ever looked at before, but since retiring I have a little more time to look at items that pique my interest.Whilst the amounts that each of us pay in tax dfers, I feel sure that the percentage paid to each of the categories will be broadly similar. For instance, the contribution to health was  per cent whilst welfare was  per cent. No surprises there in the percentage contribution. Interestingly enough, the UK contribution to the EU budget was just . per cent whilst national debt interest was . per cent.

As he waited quietly, I could just about discern him counting out the seconds in his head. Without turning round to watch what was going on in these final moments of world-class culinary creation, he simply knew who was doing what and when. Everything came together when it should. The rhythm and harmony of Fairliersquos kitchen ndash the beating heart of Scotlandrsquos only two-Michelin starred restaurant within the Gleneagles Hotel ndash was palpable, and to witness Scotlandrsquos most celebrated chef at the very top of his game was a privilege Irsquoll never forget. I am grateful to him for this and the many subsequent memorable experiences he allowed me to share. Remembering him sitting youthfully cross-legged atop the scrubbed wooden kitchen table of his Glasgow flat, grinning widely with his hair boyishly tousled, for a photographer just after he got his first Michelin star for One Devonshire Gardens in , is particularly poignant.It was Andrewrsquos quiet demeanour and waspish sense of humour that endeared him to so many, not only within the Scottish, UK and international hospitality industries, but also in the fields of art, design and, most recently, horticulture. He was a great collaborator and mentor, and he certainly had a huge personal impact on many journalists, myself included.From my numerous accompanied visits to the Victorian walled kitchen garden in Perthshire he acquired in  after an unsuccessful second course of chemotherapy, it was abundantly clear that he adored it and regarded it as his ldquosalvation, both professional and personal. He loved the quiet energy of the many specimens being cultivated by head gardener Jo Campbell exclusively for his restaurant. ldquoItrsquos so dferent from the crazy energy of the kitchen, he said. ldquoThe garden is a very calming influence and I am sure it has had a beneficial effect. Despite the chemotherapy he never lost his sense of taste and the fresh produce had a galvanising effect on his menus, with dishes headlining the greenery in line with global culinary trends. He loved that diners would travel for miles to sample his take on the fruits of the Scottish terroir, and spent many happy hours with Jo and her team. When I got my allotment last August, I laughed out loud when he cautioned me wryly against letting it take up too much of my time. God knows I know now what he meant.I like to think his humility, which endured even after joining the international culinary elite as one of only a handful of Grands Chefs du Monde, was down to his upbringing in a modest council house in Letham, Perth, and leaving school at  with no qualications. More than once he told me that he felt he was very lucky in le. Marrying his beautul, loving long-term partner Kate White last November was, he told me, the ldquoicing on the cake.At the Michelin Star awards ceremony in London last October, he was using a walking stick with some dficulty but looked deliriously happy as, surrounded by Kate and his closest chef friends, Restaurant Andrew Fairlie retained its second star for the th consecutive year. He had words of encouragement for those Scots restaurant chefs who were left disappointed not to receive a star: ldquoIn the next couple of years Scotland will do really, really well, he said.The last time I saw him was when he invited me to his home just days before the wedding and some weeks after being discharged from the Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow. Struggling under the long-term effects of chemo followed by steroids to help correct his balance, he told me that his brain tumour - first diagnosed in  - had now entered the terminal stage. He wanted the world to know that though he was finally having to give up cooking, the Gleneagles Hotel had assured him that Restaurant Andrew Fairlie would continue with the same long-standing team under head chef Stevie McLaughlin, restaurant manager Dale Dewsbury and business manager Gregor Mathieson ndash whom he had worked with since the early days at One Devonshire Gardens. Over coffee at his home overlooking the Ochils, Andrew confided that hersquod been so worried his staff may be laid off and his restaurant given over to a dferent chef that hersquod had sleepless nights angsting about it. The relief at being immediately assured otherwise was, he said, ldquoa huge weight off my shoulders. Concern for others was an abiding characteristic, and engendered le-long loyalty.For his th birthday hersquod had plans to take his trusted tight-knit team to spend time with head chef Michel Guerard at Les Pres drsquoEugenie, the three-Michelin starred restaurant in south-west France where Andrew had worked at age  as the prize for winning the very first Roux Scholarship in . ldquoThatrsquos where it all began, hersquod said. ldquoReturning will be the final piece of the jigsaw. Though hersquod subsequently had to cancel that long-cherished trip, he bore the disappointment with a philosophical acceptance. ldquoI feel very peaceful, were among his last words to me.I cherish the notebook I used to record my most recent interviews with Andrew. He liked it because of the lobster design on the cover. I was pleased hersquod noticed, as Irsquod bought it on purpose: Andrewrsquos signature dish was home-smoked Scottish lobster with warm lime and herb butter. I always meant to source a similar book for him, but could never find one as it had gone out of print.

The decision remains the same: no deal a deal or no Brexit. I am delivering on Brexit. I want to do it with a deal. Why will he not come and meet me and talk about it  she asked.Mr Corbyn replied: ldquoThe only consistency in the Prime Ministerrsquos strategy seems to be running down the clock by threatening no deal as an alternative to her dead deal.Noting how David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, had suggested the Government could not rule out a customs union with the EU, and that Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, had made clear the UK could not be in a customs union, the Labour leader askedthe PM would rule out membership of a customs union.Mrs May again said she would be happy to sit down to talk to him about what he meant by a customs union, saying: ldquoDoes he mean accepting the common external tarf  Does he mean accepting the common commercial policy  Does he mean accepting the Union customs code  Does he mean accepting EU state aid rules ldquoIf he will not talk about it, there is only one conclusion: he hasnrsquot got a clue, she insisted.Mr Corbyn later accused Mrs May of being prepared to \"sell peoples jobs and living standards down the river\" rather than negotiate a customs union.But the PM defended her approach to securing a Brexit deal before saying: \"He is doing exactly what he always does he just stands up, uses these phrases, and the honest answer is I dont think he knows what those phrases mean and what the implications of those phrases are.\"For the SNP, Ian Blackford took Mrs May to task over her failure to have a specic impact analysis of the Governmentrsquos current Brexit Plan, saying it was the ldquoheight of irresponsibility not to have drawn up one.ldquoPeople up and down the UK are going to lose their jobs and economic opportunities because of the ideology of this Government. It is important that the House reflects on that and on the economic security of our citizens. We have to be honest with people. We need to go back to them, have a Peoplersquos Vote and let them determine what should happen, insisted the Highland MP.Mrs May said the Government was considering the economic security of the country by setting out an ambitious future trade deal with the EU.She then challenged Mr Blackford, saying: ldquoIt is no good his dismissing the figures and the economic analysis that show that being part of the UK is worth pound billion in additional public spending and nearly pound, for every single person in Scotland.ldquoIf he is interested in economics, he should want to stay in the UK and stop his policy of independence."},{"url":null,"title":"beauticians to host make off","story":"Two north east beauticians are preparing to host their first ever amateur make up competition this weekend.The Great Amatuer ‘Make Off’ will be held at Thainstone House on Sunday, January .The competition will see  make up artists aged under compete in the style of the ‘Great British Bake Off’, only this will be a ‘make off’.The event has been organised by Julia Stronach and Alana McCrae in a bid to celebrate the skills and talent of young make up artists.Speaking to the Herald, Julia said: “We decided to host this event as there isn’t a  for young people showcase their skills, and there is a lot of talented young make up artists out there.“We will have judges on the day to look at all of the entries to keep it as fair as possible.“The competitors will be judged on technical, overall look and hygene.”This is the first event of its kind but it may not be the last as Julia explained: “The response has been very good, we’ve even had to turn people down as we couldn’t accept any more entries.

For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon. We would urge the Scottish Government to uphold its previous promise to start works within this financial year so that the north Highlands can start to see the benefit of this upgrade as soon as possible.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \"R J McLeod Ltd has been awarded the construction contract as part of the pound. million project to deliver improvements to the road alignment and the existing tight hairpin bend on the A.\"Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, hailed it as a positive development for the area. \"It will enhance the skills development of the Scottish construction industry, with approximately  jobs expected to be supported in the region during construction.\"Related articles:Four in running for Berriedale Braes contractSilence on A schemeWednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmTwo men will serve custodial sentences for abducting a young couple by holding them against their will in their Kirkwall home, while two women have been placed under supervision for the same crime.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored.

Set in , it sees protagonist Scott and his father James take the car ferry across the Beauly Firth to Inverness as they watch men working on the Kessock Bridge.Scott agrees to attend a farm roup with his father and feels he is being watched by a yellow eye from a dirty painting hanging amongst the lots. Unknown to his father, he successfully bids for it and his le starts to alter in remarkable ways.The action swings between Aberdeen and Florence as Scott embarks on a journey of discovery.Mr Herd, who describes himself as ldquo going on , said time spent alone working on so many films served him.He said: ldquoBy the nature of film work there wasnrsquot a typical day because all trips y. The most memorable film that I have worked on must be Swamp Tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans.ldquoUsing a converted river ferry boat as a mobile base, a typical day would be, rising at four and travelling in the dark to a hide built on stilts embedded in a channel.ldquoI would stay there on my own usually for twelve hours and I did that for months.

However, health chiefs have been accused of dragging their feet over helping to find a sustainable future model to deliver the scheme, which many of the users have said gives them a reason to get up in the morning.The project leader, who is employed by High Le Highland, has been told funding will end this month. According to Cllr Smith, garden users are ldquodevastated but adamant they wish to continue.She wants to see NHS Highland play a full role plotting the way forward, including carrying out self-directed supportassessments, a tool that aims to ensure people who are eligible for support are given the choice and control over how their inidual budget is arranged and delivered to meet their agreed health and social care outcomes.Tain-based Mike Herd, whose son has happily attended the scheme in Invergordon, said: ldquoNHS Highland made a commitment to me last year that they would try to help the garden project continue through a dferent funding formula. However, the reality is that letters asking for SDS funding have been ignored. It seems that NHS Highland have just abandoned the gardeners to a bleak futurelong-term funding cannot be agreed.Cllr Smith added: ldquoI make a plea, especially to big businesses locally, to contact me and offer some funding towards this worthwhile project that gives the adult users with learning disabilities pride and a reason to get up in the morning.ldquoIt is only a one-off payment I am seeking, not continual funding.NHS Highlandrsquos head of service for learning disabilities and autism, Arlene Johnstone, said: ldquoDue to financial pressures NHS Highland is no longer able to contribute funding to the Garden Project in Invergordon.

We have also introduced her to colleagues who have been able to advise of potential ways forward.ldquoNHS Highland is committed to ensuring that people with a learning disability can participate fully in our communities and therefore are also in discussion with High Le Highland and Councillor Maxine Smith to explore alternative ways of providing the activity that people enjoy.

Tourists visiting Scotland may also have some fun by using the haggis emoji as part of their messages to friends and family at home.

What an extraordinary situation we find ourselves in as we hurtle towards the March  deadline.This week, the Prime Minister put forward her ‘plan B’ after her withdrawal deal was comprehensively rejected last week. You may have noticed that ‘plan B’ looked remarkably similar to ‘plan A’. In fact, it was nearly identical. The only dference was the letter describing it.If the Scottish independence referendum taught us anything, it’s that politicians who fail to produce genuine plan Bs are found out by the public – as Alex Salmond discovered when he failed to outline an alternative to using the British pound in .Theresa May is treating parliament and the public like fools. That’s why she is almost certain – once again – to lose the next vote on her withdrawal deal this coming Tuesday.It’s worth reminding ourselves why there is such opposition to Downing Street’s proposal.First of all, this isn’t even about our future relationship with the EU post-Brexit. This is merely the orce agreement – the terms in which we would leave the EU.It doesn’t cover what happens after we leave and that is why there is a ‘backstop’ to the issues with the border on the island of Ireland. That explains why Number Ten appeared to be floating the dangerous idea of reopening the Good Friday Agreement, before realising that was a complete non-starter. It is an international treaty underpinned by the United Nations and ratied by referenda in the north and south of Ireland.Nobody voted for a Brexit that would see Britain giving away control and leaving people poorer. It means paying a near £ billion orce bill but getting nothing in . It is the worst of all worlds, which is why it has united both Remainers and Leavers in Parliament.: First Minister warns Theresa May must drop hardline Brexit stanceThe Prime Minister has insisted she will continue making tweaks to win over MPs, but the EU has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. It is a legal text.That is not the EU being intransigent – the Prime Minister’s red lines make this the only option for the other  member states. To get any movement, she would have to loosen those red lines.Her red lines include leaving the customs union and the single market, ensuring that freedom of movement can end. That’s the freedom of movement which has allowed Brits to travel freely and live and work in European countries, and allowed the British economy to grow by addressing worker shortages in key industries.So we’re in an almighty mess. As things stand, the default scenario the country faces is a ‘no deal’ Brexit. I fear the full impact of this catastrophic option is still misunderstood.It means leaving the EU with no withdrawal agreement in place, falling back on World Trade Organizationtrade rules. That comes with tarfs on imports and quotas, for example cars would be taxed at  per cent every time they crossed the UK-EU border, and dairy products would be hit with a  per cent tarf – hence the stockpiling of key goods. As the EU confirmed only yesterday, it would also mean a hard border with Ireland.: Poll: Two-thirds of Scots believe Brexit makes independence more likelyA ‘no deal’ Brexit would wipe tens of billions of pounds off the UK economy, including around £bn in Scotland, according to the CBI. A hit of that magnitude would have a devastating impact on jobs and living standards, plunging public services into crisis. And who would be the worst affected  The poorest people in society. So that’s why those of us who care about our constituents talk about taking no-deal “off the table”. The fear is that the Prime Minister runs the clock down until March, and we automatically fall off that no-deal clf-edge because time has run out or she bribes MPs to back her botched plan.There are ways to prevent that happening, however.The Article  timetable can be altered – either extended with the agreement of the EU or unilaterally revoked. That has to happen now regardless of the way forward.If the Prime Minister allows us to leave the EU without a deal, her Government will be deliberately choosing to inflict untold damage on its people. That would be unforgiveable.Fortunately, while the Government flounders, many MPs are rising to the occasion. A series of amendments have been submitted, including a Labour frontbench amendment which legislates for the holding of a People’s Vote. Others seek to extend the Article  process.There is, of course, little point in extending Article  in an attempt to tweak the withdrawal agreement, because the negotiations are over.It should, however, be extended so that we can go back to the people of the United Kingdom and offer them a vote to decide our future.I am open-minded about what should appear on the ballot paper, but the most obvious solution is to give voters a choice between the clear measurable propositions of Theresa May’s Brexit deal – which would confirm that the people of the UK still want to leave the EU – and keeping the best deal we already have by remaining a member state of the EU.The Prime Minister claims that a People’s Vote would be damaging to democracy, yet it’s the devastation her deal will inflict on the country that will irreparably damage our democracy – and a ‘no deal’ more so.It’s time to let democracy flourish and put control back in the hands of the British people. Next Tuesday gives parliament an opportunity to do that andthe Labour Party supports a People’s Vote amendment and whips to support it, we can achieve this goal.When that time comes, I know I will put our national interest first and campaign tirelessly for the UK to remain in the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861273.1548262308!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit sees scots tories mask slip over devolution joan mcalpine msp","story":"After Scottish Conservative MPs warn the UK Government not to give the Scottish Government a formal role in post-Brexit trade negotiations, SNP MSP Joan McAlpine says it shows they are putting #extreme unionist ideology# ahead of their constituents.The Scottish Tories were against the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in the first place. They stood alone, of all the major political parties, in their pig-headed opposition to Holyrood being allowed to exist. They campaigned against self-government in the  referendum and were roundly defeated. Democracy for Scotland was never their strong point.Ironically, the Scottish Parliament’s proportional representation system gave the Tories their best representation in decades. They even tried to re-invent themselves as a pro-devolution party.Many of us were unconvinced.Now the mask has slipped.

Yet the Scottish Tories believe decisions affecting our export business, and public services such as the NHS, are best left with this incompetent department.This confirms the Conservatives are as opposed to the notion of Scottish self-government as they ever were.It undermines attempts by Ruth Davidson and other Scottish Tories to detoxy their brand. : Theresa May says independence referendum the ‘last thing we want’Just look at Ms Davidson’s oscillating stance on Brexit. At first, she was an ardent remainer. Immediately after the EU referendum, she insisted that Scotland and the rest of the UK must stay in the single market.And now  Now, the Scottish Tory meekly accepts whatever chaotic and shambolic version of Brexit Theresa May proposes. Scotland will just have to lump it, despite voting  per cent against leaving Europe. In what other country would elected politicians lobby against having a say over key decisions affecting those they represent That fact alone exposes the utter bankruptcy of the Tory vision for Scotland.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8766908.1547223340!/image/image.jpg","title":"sdlp silent on ian paisley gobsh e tweet","story":"The SDLP has declined to comment after one of its senior figures branded the DUP#s Ian Paisley a #gobsh**e# on social media.Claire Hanna made the colourful remark on Twitter after a video emerged showing Mr Paisley declaring that his party had given the Prime Minister “precise instructions” on how to move forward with her Brexit plan.window.twttr [],t  window.twttr tjs  djs.id  idjs.src  \"https: \"fjs t._e  t t.tweetyThe DUP are fiercely opposed to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement and have insisted they will vote against it in the Commons next Tuesday unless the backstop arrangement is ditched.In a -second clip, taken from an interview with BBC Newsnight, North Antrim MP Mr Paisley is askedhe would be offering sympathy to the Prime Minister following “a dficlut day”.He repiled: “I will be asking her for milk and no sugar”.When askedhis party was still opposed to the PM’s draft treaty, Mr Paisley answered: “What do you think  Northern Ireland people are very direct, very clear,and we have given the Prime Minister precise instructions of where we think we should be in the best interests of the nation.

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell. I have lived in the area all my le andthis doesnt improve we will have to consider moving.”TUV MLA, Jim Allister, called on the company to “take urgent action”.Mr Allister led a delegation of residents to a meeting with senior management at the plant on Tuesday, January .He said: For several months these residents have been afflicted with unbearable odours from the plant which processes poultry litter.“When seeking planning permission the plant owners assured everyone they were installing state of the art technology which would ensure no smells. The supposed super efficient technology has failed and now local residents are paying the price.”Mr Allister has vowed towith the residents for a further meeting.He said he would also be pressing the Northern Ireland Environment Agency “to step up its supervision and action”.“The present intolerable position cannot continue,” he concluded.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, was aware of odour complaints relating to the Anaerobic Digestion facility at Moorfields Road, Tully Quarry.A spokesperson for the Department said: “This facility is regulated by NIEA under a Pollution Prevention and Control Permit and the permit holder is Anaerobic Advantage Ltd.“NIEA agrees that odour management at the facility has not been acceptable and the facility is currently not in compliance with its permit. In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8771209.1547630975!/image/image.jpg","title":"coffee morning to raise funds for samaritans","story":"On Saturday January , from am to .pm, a coffee morning will take place in Banbridge#s Old Town Hall, to raise much needed funds for the Samaritans.Ian Burns, one of the organisers of the event, said: “It is very concerning that Northern Ireland has the highest rate ofmale suicides, within the United Kingdom. This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  .

P children from Seymour Hill met with Mrs Jess before her birthday and found out more about her le, before sharing the story with the rest of the school.School Principal Mr Stephen Nimmons explained: “During World War Two Mrs Jess worked at a hem stitching factory near Dromore, where she worked on the machines and made fancy patterns around pillow cases and table cloths. “Every day she would have to cycle four miles to work and in the evenings four miles back home – rain, hail or snow. When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers.

The Belfast playwright’s scripts have a reputation for their intense humour, but at the heart of this play are the stark realities of working class le, isolation, and the emotional labour of mothers. The story gives the audience a veritable look into the lives of two overworked and underpaid care workers, Francesand Loretta , who look after the housebound -year-old Davy Magee, whose sole joys in le are horse betting, reading the Daily Mirror, and the music of Frank Sinatra.What turns out to be a catastrophic Monday for the pair begins with a small personal disaster for Loretta her son has forgotten his PE gear – she has to double back home and is late for work. In her absence, Francis has already helped Davy to the bathroom. Loretta arrives at Davy’s bungalow and chats to her friend about their respective family lives – Frances lambasts the education system for failing her entrepreneurial son, who has recently found success selling knock-off DVDs, while Loretta worries about her out-of-work husband and their inability to pay for their daughter’s school trip to Alton Towers. All the while Davy hasn’t emerged from the bathroom.When their charge fails to respond to repeated knocks at the door, Francis and Loretta panic, fearing the worst. As it turns out Davy has, in fact, died. Hilarity ensues as the women come to grips with his death and are presented with a further dilemma whatthey waited a few hours before reporting his demise, allowing them to withdraw his pension from the ATM and collect his winnings from the bookies  It would surely solve their money woes.Fearing the consequences of their petty crime, Frances and Loretta scheme up more and more elaborate ways to cover their tracks. Whatthey were caught  Whatthey were blamed for his death – could they be “up there with Myra Hindley and Fred West ”Theatrical comedy often treads a fine line between being side-splittingly funny and desperately exaggerated, but Fly Me To The Moon undoubtedly falls into the former camp. Despite the unfolding madness and slapstick antics, Tumelty and McGibbon manage to retain a level of realism in their fantastic performances. These two absurd characters could easily be ordinary Belfast women.Jones has written and directed a truly magnicent piece of comedy in Fly Me To The Moon but, crucially, the humour is punctuated, at critical moments, by important social commentary. Like many pensioners, the lonely Mr Magee, whose phonebook only contains the number of his bookie, lived a le in isolation – “a le of misery” as Frances says. The protagonists struggle with the daily problems of impoverished Belfast mothers, their crimes paling in comparison to the grand-scale corruption of politicians and bankers often mentioned in pages of their charge’s Daily Mirror. Loretta’s admission that her husband “even seemed smaller” since losing his job almost presented itself as a moment of comedy on the night, drawing a few solitary laughs before its signicance sank in. The preceding paragraph should leave readers in no doubt as to the hilarity of this play – there wasn’t a person at the Grand Opera House whose cheeks weren’t sore by the end.However, audiences will also go home, having had some laughs, with something more to ponder."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"hoax device alert sees residents evacuated in sub zero temperatures","story":"A number of residents from the Springfield Road area in West Belfast have been allowed toto their homes following the discovery of a suspicious object last night.The Springfield Road and Lanark Way were closed for a time as a controlled explosion was carried out by army technical officers on the suspicious object, which was later deeclared to be an elaborate hoax.

That’s all we asked and that’s what got.“Peter Healy, Kristian Healy, Odhran Eastwood, boys like that, James McAuley, Joe Maskey – calm heads. Eoin Nagle was fantastic up front.“It’s going to take a good team to beat us. I’m so proud of the boys – that was some performance.”Naomh Éanna settled into the game quickly and a goal from the impressive Kristian Healy, following good work from Nagle and midfielder Ethan Gibson, put them into a - to - lead on eight minutes.The pace of the Naomh Éanna attack created numerous goal chances in the first half, with Liam Kelly making a last-ditch clearance to deny Odhran Eastwood, but the Ulster side didn’t have long to wait before finding the net again.On  minutes, Joe Maskey and Kristian Healy put centre-forward Ruairi Scott through on goal and, despite Manus Breathnach’s best efforts in the An Spidéal goal, the shot had too much power and trickled into the net.The Galway men were reliant on free-taker Antaine Ó Lao to keep them in touch, with the centre-forward landing four frees in the first half.Yet their defence was being repeatedly unlocked by the sheer pace of Naomh Éanna, who forced several turnovers.With  minutes played, goalkeeper Breathnach was caught in possession around midfield and dropped the ball under pressure from James McAuley and Maskey with the former gathering possession.After talking a few steps forward, Maskey unleashed a shot with the outside of his right boot which carried  yards into the unguarded net.Leading by six at the break, Naomh Éanna never looked in danger of losing the game with Eastwood unerring from frees – finishing with a haul of -, with one from play. An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

the public understand that the implications… people might find themselves in a situation of being forced to assume an identy they wouldn’t choose.”Ms Logan said the offer of continued EU citizenship should be extended to all the “people of Northern Ireland” as defined by the Good Friday Agreement, given recognition of the birthright of people in Northern Ireland to identy as Irish or British, or both.“The last situation we wish to see is one where the people of Northern Ireland feel forced to choose their identity based on what they think their post-Brexit entitlements might be,” she said.Ms Logan appeared before the Justice and Equality Committee on Wednesday alongside representatives from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissionand Queen’s University to discuss the potential implications of Brexit on human rights and equality.Thank You to the Oireachtas committee on Justice and Equality for the invitation to discuss the human rights and equality implications of #Brexit https:t.co ytRNvE— Emily LoganJanuary , Brian Gormally, director of the NIHRC Committee on the Administration of Justice said thatBrexit goes ahead, it would make the status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland “insecure” and they would become “EU citizens living in a non-member state”.He said the first possibility is that the Home Office would regard Irish citizens as “really” British, the second possibility is that the Common Travel Area would sort the issue out, and thirdly that EU citizens living in the UK could apply for “settled status”.“None of these options is appealing as they all involve the implication that those who choose Irish identity are in some way second-class citizens,” Mr Gormally said.“Their rights as full participants in NI le would depend on either a denial of their Irish nationality, as yet unknown bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland about the Common Travel Area, or paying to ask the Home Office to graciously allow them leave to live in the land of their birth.“The reality is that Irish citizens, born and living in Northern Ireland, have no legal connection to the jurisdiction in which they were born.”Mr Gormally told the committee the Belfast Agreement had not been effectively implemented in UK law.He said legislation was needed in the UK and Ireland to recognise the “particular status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland” and their “unequivocal” right to participate fully in that region and in Irish society.Committee member Clare Daly, an Independents  Change TD, described the comments as “shocking and sobering”, adding that they had highlighted “scarily” a legal deficit regarding citizenship rights which needs to be addressed.Ms Logan and her Northern Ireland counterpart Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the NIHRC, warned the committee that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU threatened to undermine the human rights of the Good Friday Agreement.Ms Logan said that since , there had been substantial progress towards a lasting resolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland, but it assumed that the UK and Ireland would continue to be members of the EU.“Although the Joint Report of December  committed to protecting the Agreement ‘in all its parts’, Brexit negotiations currently depart from that common framework creating risks for both rights and remedies,” she said.Mr Gormally said Brexit had already “damaged” and “destabilised” the peace settlement and relations across the island.“Questions of identity and citizenship have been opened up in a way not seen since well before the Agreement – those genies cannot be put back in the bottle,” he said.“We therefore need a set of measures, across the island and, where possible, on the basis of formal treaties between the two sovereign states involved.”"},{"url":null,"title":"key services restored to londonderry after days of unrest","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all.

If you fail to reach agreement these terms come into effect, that constrains your negotiating power. Why should the other side give you better terms unless you are able to offer them something  inthat is better for them ”Labour MP Kate Hoey summarised his comments as meaning “we are going in with our hands tied behind our back”.The backstop, contained in the proposed EU withdrawal treaty, has been arguably the most contentious aspect of the whole withdrawal process.A transition period kicks in after March , keeping the UK under EU rules until at least the end of .However, the backstop is the set of arrangements which will kick inthe UK and EU have still not finalised a deal by the time that transition arrangement runs out.It would effectively keep the whole UK under EU customs union rules, and keep Northern Ireland in particular under rules concerning the single market. The backstop arrangement can only end with EU agreement.Barrister Isabelle Van Damme, another lawyer who gave evidence, challenged the assumption Europe is not interested in striking a deal.The barrister, who is a member of the Brussels Bar, said: “I have a bit of a dficulty with accepting that as a starting point because there are so many matters in which the EU and the  member states co-operate to the advantage of the respective economies.”After the meeting, the committee chairman Dr Andrew Murrison said: “My committee wants to ensure that the implications of the full range of Brexit outcomes for Northern Ireland, including leaving with no deal, are fully recognised and understood.“The lawyers my committee heard from today laid out the spectrum of legal positions on the backstop, assurances from the European Union and the definition of a hard border. What they made clear is that the complexities of the withdrawal agreement are not free from legal interpretation, which I suspect may lead to continued political fall out in the days ahead.”Marketing firm Fat Fish builds Newry team Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Last November, the News Letter had published a piece penned by Mr Howe shortly after the Withdrawal Agreement was published.

I have to take their word for it”.Instead of a merger she expects “a partnership to do with policy issues,” and that she said is “relatively content” with such an arrangement.When it comes to dissent within the party, she said: “My understanding is there is a special meeting of the SDLP to be arranged within the next few weeks. I don’t envisage any big departures to be quite honest – there is no change to the constitution as I can see it of the SDLP. This is about a partnership, about a working together with Fianna Fail.”There has been talk for years of a possible merger between the roughly--year-old SDLP, headquartered in Belfast, and the far larger-year-old party, headquartered in Dublin.However, speculation ramped up signicantly at the New Year when a report in thequoted a “well-placed” anonymous Fianna Fail source as saying that what is planned is a “phased process” which will result in “one all-island party which will be called Fianna Fáil”.Besides confirming that talks were indeed under way, the SDLP leadership has said little about what is envisaged, and SDLP members have complained of being kept in the dark about the plans.However, on Tuesday night there was a meeting of Fianna Fail members, with the party’s foreign affairs spokesman Niall Collins saying “the proposal on the table to form a partnership is fully endorsed by the parliamentary party”.It is also understood SDLP MLAs and leadership met on Tuesday too ahead of tomorrow’s announcement .In pictures: Murder victim laid to rest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingSnow brings N.I. to standstill - traffic chaos as Belfast International Airport shuts runwayN.I. man dies after he is electrocuted while fitting new lightN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursIN PHOTOS:  pictures of the heavy snowfall in Northern IrelandN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degC          ..

He is very focused on where he comes from. He’s very keen to do the right thing in helping to build positive relations through sport. He doesn’t seek any kudos for it.”He added: “After the formalities of the presentations Jacob is probably spending another hour with the kids, signing autographs and taking selfies.“I don’t consider myself old but I’m more than twice Jacob’s age. When you are in your late forties speaking to an assembly of school kids they look at you thinking you’re old. “Jacob is . They’re looking at him thinking he’s not much older than us. He speaks the same language as them, they can relate to him.“It’s nice to have an accessible sporting star.”Although Jacob was born in Newtownstewart, he moved to Lurgan as a schoolboy, going to school at Wallace HS in Lisburn. Up until very recently he lived with his mother and father in Lurgan, but has now moved to Belfast.Gavin said: “Lurgan is a very polarised town. The overriding aim of the project is to reach the hand across the community. Although Lurgan is the lead club we’re engaging with local Gaelic clubs – Eire Og and St Peter’s.“We have a sport like rugby which is played on an All Ireland basis and we have an inidual who could make it into a world XV team on our doorstep and who is willing to turn up at school events.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight. By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However, he has ldquocategorically denied a claim of bullying and has vowed to clear his name.Pier  Limited was contacted for comment regarding its closure. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
