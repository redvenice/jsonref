[{"url":null,"title":"Britains self driving vehicle trials launch Milton Keynes MailOnline tests Aurrigos AutoPod","story":"Share this article Speaking on the MK:5G experiment, Digital Infrastructure Minister Julia Lopez told MailOnline: \u0027This pioneering £2 million trial will see how 5G-powered tech can improve stadium experiences.\u0027Driverless shuttles will help people and goods travel around the site, robots will help hotel guests with their luggage and deliver room service, and autonomous surveillance vehicles and drones will improve security.\u0027The scheme is all part of our £200 million programme across the UK to demonstrate and test how we can seize the opportunities of 5G to turbocharge our economy and help businesses bounce back from the pandemic.\u0027Miles explains that Milton Keynes has become an attractive destination for tech companies such as Aurrigo.The town\u0027s grid road infrastructure, which 1970s architects drew from California\u0027s urban theorist Melvin Webber and weaving footpaths that run parallel to its dual carriageways, ensures traffic flows freely and is accessible for all.\u0027The council are ever so open to innovation and as a company that makes the area a really attractive destination\u0027, he adds. That\u0027s a view shared by Milton Keynes Council\u0027s leader Pete Marland, who has been in charge of the coalition-run local authority since May. Mr Marland points to the history of innovation seen in Milton Keynes, which was home to the Bletchley Park codebreakers, and the fact automotive giants Volkswagen, Mercedes and Formula One team Red Bull Racing set up their headquarters in the town.\u0027Milton Keynes is the home of thinking differently, and these self-driving trials help to prove that. It\u0027s all helping us determine the sort of city we want to build in the future and that\u0027s an important thing for the UK as a whole,\u0027 he said.\u0027The AutoPods carry on a history of transport innovation seen in the Milton Keynes area. We had the canals, Wolverton\u0027s as the first railway town, Bletchley Park of course. We were built on the car in the 1960s and 70s, and we will continue to do so in the future.\u0027Mr Marland is also quick to point out that getting behind the wheel of a car isn\u0027t always 100 per cent safe, and is urging members of the public to try out the autonomous vehicles before passing judgement on them. \u0027Humans driving cars aren\u0027t perfectly safe. The AI has shown to be safer than human driving in semi and fully autonomous vehicles like this, it\u0027s just a matter of people catching up with that technology.\u0027Features like auto park and lane change assist are already built-in to many modern vehicles and this is just that next logical step.\u0027 According to statistics shared on Gov.uk, \u0027human error\u0027 contributes to more than 85 per cent of all accidents on Britain\u0027s roads. Brian Matthews, the Council\u0027s transport officer, anticipates the trial being expanded to other areas in the town, namely the busy railway station and the shopping centre, by the end of the year. \u0027It\u0027s so important that we use technology to help the city grow in a sustainable way that supports the quality of life for our citizens. We have a culture, I think, in Milton Keynes that sees innovation as a way forward and stretching the boundaries.\u0027Exploring driverless technology is something we want to do because there are huge potential advantages, and we need to understand what those are before we invest in them fully. \u0027Are they safer? Do they increase productivity? Reduce congestion? Most importantly for the city, do they increase mobility options for those who can\u0027t drive? These are all very important factors that we are trying to consider\u0027. I\u0027m keen to hear Brian\u0027s views on how he thinks the future of autonomous vehicles will play out, both in Milton Keynes and further afield. \u0027I don\u0027t think autonomous vehicles will be our sole future, rather it will play a part in our future\u0027, he explains.\u0027I think we already realise that it\u0027s not a one-size fits all situation and it will be a mix, and self-driving vehicles will be a part of that mix\u0027.Others have a much more optimistic view. Miles makes clear he thinks we are witnessing the start of an exciting new future for transport as a whole. \u0027Everyone in the world is currently working on autonomous vehicles. They are the future, and they will be on our roads. There\u0027s absolutely no doubt about that.\u0027 As my morning in the AutoPod wraps up I\u0027m filled with many questions. How will driverless vehicles work on many of the UK\u0027s roads that were not meticulously designed for motorists? Will the public be receptive to such huge change?Most pressingly, was my trip around the stadium actually any faster than walking? A quick search on Google suggests not - their Maps function predicts my trip would have taken less than 10 minutes on foot.  I have little doubt that this slow-moving start marks a tentative first step forward into something that could one day be a feasible option for public transport seen in both Milton Keynes and wider afield. So although my 15-minute journey in the driverless AutoPod may have been one short drive for man, only time will tell if it was yet another a giant leap for all of mankind.  Tesla Crashed in Full Self-Driving Mode, Owner Files NHTSA Report"},{"url":null,"title":"Katie Prices ex Kieran Hayler accuses party making false claims","story":"Share this articleKatie Price¿s ex-husband Kieran Hayler will be quizzed by cops over three rape allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"Ministers slammed classroom ventilation scheme children sit freezing classrooms","story":"Share this article It came as Boris Johnson urged teachers who insist masks are still worn in lessons to follow the rules that no longer require their use in classrooms.Head teachers in England are set to ignore the Prime Minister\u0027s bonfire of Plan B restrictions by compelling pupils to wear face coverings in classrooms.Britain\u0027s big teaching unions have accused the embattled Tory leader of making the decision to save his own political career as he handles the fallout from \u0027Partygate\u0027, rather than basing it on \u0027sound public health and scientific advice\u0027.The National Education Union warned against lifting Omicron measures \u0027too quickly\u0027, claiming it could lead to \u0027more disruption\u0027 for schools.Today a No10 spokesman said: \u0027Children have been one of the hardest hit as a result of the disruption throughout the pandemic and we recognise the impact it has had on their education.\u0027The Prime Minister believes it is vital that children are receiving face-to-face education and can enjoy a normal experience in the classroom and the Prime Minister also thinks that the schools should follow the latest guidance.\u0027We\u0027ve been clear that we removed the requirement for face masks to be worn in classrooms and we will remove advice for face masks to be worn in communal areas from January 27.\u0027       Covid infections are rising among primary school children in England, official data shows in what could be a sign of the back-to-school effect.Statisticians at the Office for National Statistics estimated eight per cent of youngsters aged two to 11 had Covid on any given day in the week to January 15, the equivalent of one in 13, up slightly from 7 per cent the week prior.The rate, based on swabs taken from 160,000 people across the country, is the highest of all other age groups, with 20 to 34-year-olds having the next highest rate (one in 17).While rates are falling or flatlining in every other age group they are still climbing in children. Just five per cent of under-12s were thought to have the virus a month earlier.It comes after children returned to classrooms on January 4 after a two-week break over the festive period.Despite the rising infections in primary school and nursery-aged children, the ONS found that infections fell across England for the first time since Omicron took off last week. It estimated around 2.9million people were infected on any given day in the week to January 15, a \u0027welcome decrease\u0027 from the record 3.7m the previous week. The ONS survey is regarded as the most reliable indicator of the UK\u0027s outbreak because it uses random sampling of around 100,000 people, rather than relying on people coming forward to be tested. "},{"url":null,"title":"Mystery man rings couples doorbell Thursday 2am 4am Gloucestershire","story":"Share this article A Gloucestershire Police spokesperson said of the latest incident:  \u0027A member of the public approached their local Neighbourhood Engagement Vehicle and reported that an unknown man had been ringing their doorbell in the night then walking away.\u0027They reported that these incidents have gone on at their home address at London Road, Stroud, for a number of months and sometimes multiple times in one night.\u0027Police are appealing for the public’s help to identify the man who’s been photographed by the electronic doorbell.\u0027If anyone recognises this man or has any information please contact police on 101 or by completing the online form and quoting incident number 484 of 13 January: https:www.gloucestershire.police.uktuatell-us-aboutcortell-us-about-existing-case-report  Phantom knocker targeting Stroud house after midnight leaving woman scared to sleep - Gloucestershire Live"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b677309be21a5cb2f69195e507ed74307b116d3/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=558ed6897aa715d11d652b20950d1729","title":"watford v norwich city premier league live score updates","story":"Norwich make just one change from the side that beat Everton, and it’s an enforced one.

Psaki added that the Biden administration is continuing its efforts with Congress to codify Roe v Wade into law, but that goal will be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve with Democrats’ current narrow majorities in the House and Senate.Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, decried Roe v Wade decision handed down by an all-male majority on the supreme court in 1973.“Murder is not a women’s right,” read one sign carried by a young man in a Donald Trump beanie. Another popular sign read “BLM  Babies Lives Matter.”  A memo by reproductive rights organization Naral accused the anti-abortion movement of “co-opting social justice rhetoric in order to make its extreme agenda appear more palatable.”“In this critical moment for the future of reproductive freedom, we must call out the anti-choice movement’s fake ‘feminism’ for what it is: a tactic for maintaining white, patriarchal control,” it read. At the annual March for Life demonstration in D.C., anti-abortion activists were optimistic the Supreme Court will soon overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a woman’s right to abortion access. “We are hoping and praying that this year, 2022, will bring a historic change for life,” Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, said. The crowd for the march was tens of thousands strong, and attendees waved signs that read: “I am the post-Roe generation” and “the future is anti-abortion.” Speaking at the rally, Congressman Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, said there was “fresh hope and heightened expectations” that a new conservative-supermajority on the Supreme Court would reverse Roe, overturning nearly half a century of precedent on abortion rights.The Hill has more details on the initiative: The president said the bill would also establish a more just tax system in the US, arguing it was time for the wealthiest Americans to pay their “fair share” in taxes. “Raise your hand if you think the present tax structure is fair. And we’ll take a picture of you and send it home,” Biden joked, prompting laughs from the crowd at the US Conference of Mayors’ meeting. The Build Back Better Act has stalled in the Senate due to opposition from Democrat Joe Manchin, but there were signs of renewed energy to restart negotiations this week. The president closed his remarks with his standard pitch about American resilience, and he applauded the mayors’ work for their cities and towns. “Keep it going, folks. We need you badly,” Biden told the mayors.The president specifically celebrated the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which he signed into law in November. Biden also addressed reiterated his position on the need to increase funding for police departments, a stance that is at odds with many progressives in his party.  “We shouldn’t be cutting funding for police departments,” Biden said. “I proposed increasing funding.”Chad Stark, a 54 year-old resident of Texas, was arrested by law enforcement after officials allege he posted a message on Craigslist on 5 January 2021 saying that he wanted “Georgia Patriots” to kill several election officials. Stark was charged with one count of communicating interstate threats, which has a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He is expected to make his first appearance in an Austin, Texas court on Friday afternoon. “The Justice Department has a responsibility not only to protect the right to vote, but also to protect those who administer our voting systems from violence and illegal threats of violence,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland.Peter Stone reports for the :  FBI agents and the House panel investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol have both learned of an alleged plan by allies of retired army Lt Gen Michael Flynn to gather “intelligence” on top Republicans to “move” them to back election audits in key states Trump lost, said ex-whistleblower Everett Stern who talked to the panel and the FBI. Stern, who runs the intelligence firm Tactical Rabbit and is a Republican vying for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, in multiple interviews with the  said two Flynn associates with the rightwing Patriot Caucus group enlisted his help in April in a scheme to seek potentially damaging information on two Republican members of Congress to prod them to back an audit of the 2020 vote that Joe Biden won. Stern told the  he spent several hours in November telling House panel investigators about the alleged drive by Flynn associates who sought campaign finance and other dirt on Pennsylvania’s Senator Pat Toomey and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick to win their support for an audit to bolster Trump’s debunked charges that Biden’s win was fraudulent.’ See the full story below ... The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.“You tell me,” Psaki replied. “Is there a proposal where there are 10 Republicans? I’m not aware of one.”  The question comes two days after Joe Biden expressed confidence that “big chunks” of the Build Back Better Act could still get enacted. That sparked questions about whether the bill would be split into several components, but that would likely mean those proposals would not be eligible for passage via reconciliation, which allows Democrats to circumvent the Senate filibuster. Psaki seemed to indicate Democrats were still focused on passing a package via reconciliation, saying, “What the president was talking about is, we have 50 votes in the Senate. We’re going to get as much -- a big, mountain-sized chunk, whatever you want to call it -- as much as we can of the Build Back Better agenda that we can get 50 votes for.”Secretary of state Antony Blinken met with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva today to continue the discussions over Ukraine. Psaki said that Blinken communicated Russia would suffer “swift and severe consequences” if President Vladimir Putin launches an invasion. The press secretary added that, while there were no major breakthroughs in the talks today, the US is still urging Russia to pursue a path of “dialogue and diplomacy”. “It is up to them to decide which path they are going to choose,” Psaki said. “We are on a clearer path to understanding each other’s concerns.”“The President commended Prime Minister Kishida’s strong commitment to the U.S.-Japan Alliance, and his determination to fundamentally strengthen Japan’s defense capabilities to reinforce deterrence against common threats,” the White House said in its readout of the meeting. “The leaders committed to work closely together to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine, and Prime Minister Kishida pledged to continue close coordination with the United States, other Allies and partners, and the international community on taking strong action in response to any attack.” The White House also noted that Biden “welcomed Prime Minister Kishida’s invitation to visit Japan for the next Quad Leaders Meeting in the first half of 2022”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34a9eb4fb3ce9d1aaa984ef84c884d143e14f2b5/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6760b6a7b643950163405997077ad4a2","title":"covid news live africa sees cases drop significantly experts say australias omicron wave likely peaked","story":"Confirming the news, he said “we have weathered the Omicron storm” but accepted the lifting of measures will likely cause a rise in infections in the short term but added that he was confident impact will be limited.

He said he had spoken to Ireland on “many dark days” but said: “today is a good day.”The federal government has tens of millions of tests on hand to ship out and will disclose next week how many households have ordered them, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients told reporters at a briefing. The push to get tests in the hands of Americans at no cost, along with free higher quality masks, comes as the surge in cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant began to subside in some states. There were about 744,600 cases per day on average in the past seven days.The 78-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate said on Facebook that he was surprised to find out he is infected despite the three vaccination doses he has received. “I can’t believe it: I received 3 shots, .... (but) I’m infected. (I have a) headache, I can’t warm up my body. I feel like my flesh is tearing away from the bones,” Mr Walesa wrote. “After this painful lesson I will never separate from my mask.”Overall, they suggest that boosters helped protect against both infection and symptomatic disease. Adults aged 50 and older saw the most benefit from an extra dose of the vaccines made by BioNTech with Pfizer or Moderna. “Protection against infection and hospitalisation with the Omicron variant is highest for those who are up to date with their vaccination, meaning those who are boosted when they are eligible,” CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said in a White House briefing on Friday. As has been shown in other countries, vaccine boosters performed better against the Delta variant than Omicron, a highly mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has been able to evade immunity from vaccines and prior infections.It is also determined that people will need booster shots after five months to maintain Covid passes giving access to bars or cinemas, Reuters reported. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo extended opening for bars and restaurants to midnight from 11pm, allowed indoor activities such as play areas and bowling alleys to reopen and said venues with good ventilation could host more people than now. The changes will apply from next Friday. De Croo said that from March 1 the initial vaccination series would be valid only for five months, with boosters required to keep Covid passes active, although they would still be valid with a test or recent recovery from infection.Let’s start with a bit more detail on the lifting of Covid restrictions in Ireland, which has been announced today. Taoiseach Micheal Martin said it is “time to be ourselves again” as he announced the lifting of almost all Covid restrictions, according to the Press Association. Earlier on Friday, Cabinet signed off plans to lift all regulations - except for mask-wearing, self-isolation and Covid passes for international travel - from 6am on Saturday morning. Workers will return to offices on a staggered basis from Monday while normal hours will resume in the hospitality industry this weekend. An Nphet report has advised the government that Ireland has “weathered the Omicron storm” and that all the key indicators have stabilised and are going in the right direction. In an address to the nation, Mr Martin said:  Guidance on household visits and restrictions on gatherings at indoor and outdoor events will be lifted. The Covid pass for international travel will remain, due to the Covid-19 situation in other countries. Masks will still be needed in all the locations where they are currently required. Protective measures will also remain in place in primary and secondary schools. This will be reviewed at the end of February, by which time all children aged five to 11 will have had the opportunity to be vaccinated, he said. He urged parents to vaccinate their children and speak to their GPs about any concerns they may have.Confirming the news, he said “we have weathered the Omicron storm” but accepted the lifting of measures will likely cause a rise in infections in the short term but added that he was confident impact will be limited.  He confirmed that some supports would remain in place for businesses.  “You did what you were asked to do,” he said and told the country “your collective efforts have saved thousands of lives”. He said he had spoken to Ireland on “many dark days” but said: “today is a good day.”• Ireland looked set to rapidly unwind almost all Covid-19 restrictions with ministers due to meet on Friday to agree on a timetable after being given the all-clear by public health officials. • There were 95,787 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the UK on Friday, the government said. The figure is based on positive lab-confirmed PCR tests, but also includes most positive lateral flow tests reported in England and all lateral flow tests reported in Northern Ireland. • European Union health ministers were told on Friday to prepare to deploy a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccines as soon as data showed it was needed, as the bloc faces a surge in cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. • The estimated range of England’s Covid-19 reproduction “R” number has fallen to between 0.8 and 1.1, the UK Health Security Agency said, adding that cases are likely to be shrinking as prime minister Boris Johnson reopens the economy. • The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, urged Poles to work from home as daily Covid-19 infections reached their highest ever level. • Australia on Friday reported its deadliest day of the pandemic with 80 coronavirus fatalities, as an outbreak of the omicron variant continued to take a toll.“I am so pleased to be able to say that as of 6 am tomorrow, the vast majority of restrictions that have been in place for almost two years now, on and off, will be lifted,” Helen McEntee said in a video posted on social media following a government meeting. “I don’t think any of us thought we’d actually be getting to this point as quickly as we are now,” she added. Prime Minister Micheal Martin is due to make a televised address on Friday evening to announce the measures. Ireland had the second highest incidence rate of Covid-19 in Europe just last week but also one of the continent’s highest uptake of booster vaccines, which has helped keep the number of seriously ill people well below the previous peak. Following advice from public health officials, the government decided that bars and restaurants will no longer need to close at 8 pm, a restriction put in place late last year when the Omicron wave struck, or to ask customers for proof of vaccination. Capacity in indoor and outdoor venues is also set to return to full capacity, paving the way for full crowds for next month’s Six Nations rugby championship. Some measures, such as the need to wear a mask on public transport and in shops, will remain in place for now."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Some \u0026lsquodramatised\u0026rsquo shots in the BBC\u0026rsquos The Snow Wolf were implausibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 pandemic as we have known it is going to be behind us soon","story":"Chief medical officer  Dr Tony Holohan and other members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).  Once Nphet had vaccines as insurance last year, members relaxed considerably in their approach to Covid-19. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsWell, that is understandable, because we are moving into a new phase of dealing with the virus, where new rules apply. The pandemic as we have known it for two years is going to be behind us very soon. Covid-19 will still be a threat but not to the all-encompassing extent we have grown used to.Let’s start with the decision by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to approve the lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions, which is based on three key factors.The first is the existence of effective vaccines against the disease that have been taken by the vast majority of the population. Though these do not prevent transmission, they work very well to stop people getting seriously ill.Ministers are reportedly surprised at the willingness of public health officials to lift restrictions so quickly, but they shouldn’t be. Once Nphet had vaccines in their back-pocket as insurance last year, its members relaxed considerably in their approach. Yes, fresh restrictions were imposed in the second half of last year, but these were dictated primarily by the threat to a creaking health service.That has now passed. The second factor is the evidence, apparent for some weeks, that the current Omicron wave is not overwhelming hospitals. The peak of cases is behind us and all the indicators are currently pointing in the right direction.Omicron favour Thirdly, Omicron has done us all a favour by decimating the previous, more virulent Delta variant. It has also clarified the approach needed from public health officials around the globe there’s little point in trying to duck and e with Omicron, as it is so transmissible that almost everyone is going to get it.Every day, about 125 million people are getting infected with Omicron, the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has estimated. This is 10 times higher than the Delta peak last year. By the end of March, more than half the world’s population is expected to have been infected, in just four months.But how can a disease so widespread be a good thing? As many as 90 per cent of these infections will be asymptomatic people will hardly notice them but they are benefitting from increased immunity.Throughout the pandemic, IHME models have been pessimistic yet accurate, and the institute has repeatedly called for higher levels of mask-wearing to protect against the virus. Yet this is what its director Prof Christopher Murray wrote in The Lancet this week: “The transmission intensity of Omicron is so high that policy actions-eg, increasing mask use, expanding vaccination coverage in people who have not been vaccinated, or delivering third doses of Covid-19 vaccines-taken in the next weeks will have limited impact on the course of the Omicron wave.”Mask useIncreasing use of masks to 80 per cent of the population, for example, will only reduce cumulative infections over the next four months by 10 per cent, his modelling suggests. “The speed of the Omicron wave is so fast that policy actions will have little effect on its course globally in the next four to six weeks,” Murray adds.This is the new ball-game, in which the return on enforcing restrictive measures in the context of a milder illness is so diminished as to be of little value. A combination of vaccine-induced (preferable for most people, because less risky) and infection-induced immunity is protecting against Covid-19 in Ireland, and will soon do the same in many other countries whose Omicron waves have yet to peak.The World Health Organisation was not wrong to say this week that the pandemic is “nowhere near over”. Other countries will see the number of patients in hospital rise, just as Ireland did after Christmas, but this should not last very long.So what will happen now? It won’t be all plain sailing. Our case numbers may rise as people get back to mixing more freely with others and colleges re-open.New variants will pop up, and we’ll have to deal with them. Even Delta hasn’t gone away completely. BA.2, a sub-lineage of Omicron, may already be contributing to rising cases in Denmark, and will have to be watched closely.Waning immunityWaning vaccine immunity is a problem, one that could be solved in time for next winter by better vaccines. Winter 202223, when cases rise again and hospitals come under pressure, will be a challenge anyway.Covid-19 will be around for some time to bother us. We’ll be able to treat the vulnerable with antivirals and prevent them getting infected with masks and physical distancing. Improving ventilation and air quality in schools and other busy locations seems like a no-brainer. More genomic sequencing will be needed to spot AY.2 and emerging threats more quickly.Without realising it, many people have become “institutionalised” during the pandemic some will struggle with the freedoms offered as it ends. All of us will have to find the right balance that allows us to live again while feeling safe. That balance will vary hugely according to our perception of risk 20 years after the SARS outbreak, many people in Asia continued to wear masks in public places.For now, though, this phase is over.

At homeLimits on the number of households that can mix in each other’s homes have been scrapped.Special eventsLimits on the numbers attending weddings have been removed.In the workplaceFrom Monday, a phased return to the office is planned, appropriate to each sector. The Government will consult with unions and employers’ groups, and firms are being encouraged to consult with their workers over the best approach. It is anticipated the phases will conclude by the end of February. Travelling overseasThere are no changes. The digital Covid cert remains, and for those without proof of vaccination or recovery or a negative test, they must produce a negative PCR test result from no more than 72 hours before arrival. The passenger locator form remains. MasksA mask will be required in all the settings in which it is currently regulated: retail, transport, public offices, among those in consumer-facing roles, airports, stations and ports. This will be retained until February 28th. VisitsVisits to health services such as day services, and residential facilities such as nursing homes are not restricted. Schools and childcareThe current arrangements and protective measures are being retained until February 28th, to allow all eligible children be vaccinated in line with their parents’ consent. Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS)This was altered and extended when restrictions were introduced in December. Planned cuts (a reversion to a two-rate subsidy) will come in on February 1st for most companies, followed by a flat rate subsidy of €100 in March and April. For those companies who became newly eligible under December restrictions, that will be delayed by a month. Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS)An extra week will be paid to businesses after restrictions are lifted. Employers’ PRSIThis will be reinstated at the full rate from March 1st. The tax debt warehousing scheme has been extended from the end of March to the end of April. Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP)Entry to the scheme, which was extended to the end of the month when restrictions were reintroduced, is closed from January 22nd. Anyone remaining on PUP will move to a weekly rate of €208 from March 8th, and onto a jobseekers’ payment from April 5th. Enhanced illness benefit is being extended to the end of June. IsolationPeople who develop symptoms of Covid are asked to isolate and get a test, while close contacts are to follow HSE guidance. Boosters and vaccines, and the use of masks appropriately, is advised.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced the lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions telling the Irish people they responded when hit by an unprecedented health emergency saying: “You did what you were asked to do.” He acknowledged there has been grief at the loss of life but said the public’s “collective efforts have saved thousands of lives”. Having spoken to the Irish people on “many dark days” he said “today is a good day”.Mr Martin said Ireland has “weathered the Omicron storm” with the rate of infections now reducing and key indicators having stabilised and going in right direction.The vaccine programme has “utterly transformed our situation” and the rationale and justification for continuing most of the public health restrictions are no longer there, he said.“Spring is coming and I don’t know if I have ever looked forward to one as much as this one. Humans are social beings and we Irish are more social than most. As we look forward to this spring, we need to see each other again, we need to see each other smile, we need to sing again.”At the start of his speech Mr Martin noted that on this day in 1919 the first Dáil met and formally declared the country’s independence.“As we face into our second century as a free democracy, and as we navigate this new phase of Covid, it is time to be ourselves again,” he said. Mr Martin’s address to the nation came after the Cabinet agreed to lift almost all Covid-19 restrictions from 6am on Saturday. Household visits will be permitted with no restrictions, the early closing time for hospitality and events will be scrapped, as will capacity restrictions for outdoor events and indoor events, including weddings. The same is true for many protective measures including requirements for physical distancing, seated only indoor tables, pods of six for activities, the Covid pass requirement for all venues and activities, and the requirement to maintain contact details. Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen and a phased return to the office will begin from Monday. Mr Martin said the recovery of Ireland’s society and economy “is already underway and we will continue to do what is necessary to support it.”The Cabinet had decided to continue and extend the provision of a number of supports, highlighting the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, he said. Mr Martin also said the Government will work with colleagues at a European and International level “to ensure the rapid deployment of vaccines and therapeutics across Africa and the developing world”. “None of us will be fully safe until we are all safe.”“There is much to do” he continued. “But today is a good day, and we should all take a moment to appreciate how far we’ve come to appreciate the effort and sacrifice of those who put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe to remember and appreciate the lives and contribution of those we lost.”He said the news will be welcomed by many but he is conscious that some people will feel anxiety about re-engaging with others. “For those who do feel like that, I’d ask you to be open about it, share it. “We all need to be open with each other, be supportive of each other. Travel and mask wearingMask wearing will still be required in all settings where it is currently regulated for until February 28th, with protective measures in schools and childcare facilities remaining until that date. Mr Martin said that because of the international situation there are no changes to the current measures in place for travel. He said the advice for those with symptoms, positive cases and close contacts remains in place. The remaining measures will be reviewed by the end of February by which time all children aged between 5 and 11 will have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. Mr Martin urged parents to engage with their GPs about the vaccines saying they are safe for children.More broadly he said the unvaccinated and unboosted suffer the most from the virus and he urged people who haven’t had the jabs to get them.He said: “The pandemic isn’t over. It will still require all of us to be vigilant The changes we are making will likely lead to a temporary rise in infections in the short term but we are advised that the impact of this rise will be limited by the scale of vaccination in the population.”Mr Martin said: “I can’t promise you there won’t be further twists in this pandemic requiring different decisions in the future but I do know this.“Solidarity in each other and trust in science has got us to where we are today and will get us through whatever else this virus may throw at us.”He said the Government’s job is to prepare for any future wave of the disease and hospital and ICU capacity will continue to be expanded.Business supportsAt a press conference on Friday evening, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said people can look forward cautiously to “a spring and summer of freedom”.He said the there will be “bumps in the road ahead” but also “confidence if this is not the end it’s the beginning of the end”.Mr Varadkar, the Minister for Enterprise, said workers and businesses “have been to hell and back” and while restrictions end tomorrow the supports will not.He said the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will not be phased out fully until April 5th and this will allow more time for 80,000 people still getting the payment to get their jobs back or find new ones.The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) payments to employers will reduce for sectors not impacted by the most recent restrictions until they’re stopped on April 30th.For hospitality and live entertainment businesses affected by the 8pm curfew EWSS will continue at the higher rate for an extra month until the end of February before being reduced and stopping altogether on May 31st.Mr Varadkar said there will be no cliff edge but there will have to be an end to the payments. Minister for Culture and Tourism Catherine Martin said there have been many lost days and weeks “and worse we have lost loved ones”.However, she said that as a result of the changes announced on Friday young people can go out and meet friends again, can play music, can dance and cheer on their favourite sports team again.She said there will be a return to full stadiums.Ms Martin confirmed that there will be a St Patrick’s Day parade in Dublin this year and there is €2 million in funding for it. She said that some nightclubs will “unfortunately” not be able to reopen until Wednesday as they will have to go through the process of getting their special exemption orders under licensing laws from the District Court. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “It is important to say the pandemic itself is not over”.He said there is still a high number of cases and vigilance must remain for variants of concern. Mr Holohan said there may be an increase in case numbers as a result of the changes – particularly among school-going children.He said such increases have been seen in other countries but this was taken into account in the advice the National Health emergency Team gave to Government. Mr Martin was asked if hand-shakes are back.He replied: “If you’re comfortable and if you feel safe shaking someone’s hand, yes.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"travel may become more difficult for those with expiring vaccination certificates","story":"Cabinet was told today that almost 45,000 people have a primary vaccination certificate that will expire by February 1st. Photograph: Nick BradshawTens of thousands of people could face additional difficulties in travelling overseas from the start of next month, as their digital Covid cert will not be accepted anymore. Cabinet was told today that almost 45,000 people have a primary vaccination certificate that will expire by February 1st, but who have not yet received a booster or a had a recent Covid infection confirmed by a PCR test.From that date, people must have had a booster or confirmed Covid infection within the last nine months in order to be eligible for a digital Covid cert. While travel within the EU is, strictly speaking, allowed without a cert, it can be arduous and complex.Among the 45,000 people will be a certain number who died since receiving their second shot, but many more may have been caught out by a quirk of testing rules introduced as the State’s PCR capacity was exhausted out over Christmas. Under those rules, people aged between four and 39 years were asked to take regular antigen tests before booking a PCR test, and in many instances would not have received a confirmed PCR test result. Most will now have recovered, and therefore will not be able to get a confirmatory PCR test. However, they are also advised not to get a booster shot until they are three months past their Covid infection, so they will not be able to get a digital Covid cert this way either. One option available would be to get a private PCR or antigen test and obtain their digital Covid cert that way.Some others may have chosen not to receive a booster shot. Cabinet was also told that many more people could face this situation by the end of March - although these people may have a third shot between then and now. In a worst case scenario, cabinet was told that 207,572 people could face their vaccination cert expiring in these circumstances by the end of March.Cabinet was told today that almost 45,000 people have a primary vaccination certificate that will expire by February 1st,Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"us agrees to respond to russian demands during geneva talks","story":"US secretary of state Antony Blinken (left) and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. The diplomats had a frank exchange of views during talks. Photograph: EPA US secretary of state Anthony Blinken has promised Russia written responses to its concerns over Ukraine, but insisted Washington would not engage in negotiations with Moscow over sovereign rights it considers under threat.After a “frank” meeting in Geneva, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he was open to further talks with western countries, whom he accused of spreading “hysteria” over the Russia-Ukraine stand-off.“This was not a negotiation but a candid exchange of concerns and ideas,” said Mr Blinken, promising a “swift, severe and a united response” to any invasion of Ukraine. “There are certain issues and fundamental principles that the United States and our partners and allies are committed to defend, that includes those that would impede the sovereign right of the Ukrainian people to write their own future.”Mr Lavrov expressed satisfaction that the US had agreed to answer Russian concerns in writing and insisted Moscow had “never once threatened the Ukrainian people”.“We again tried to bring to the forefront problems on the Russian-Ukrainian border as the main issue, they tried to present de-escalation as the main thing, repeated like a mantra,” said Mr Lavrov. “I cannot say whether we are on the right track or not, we will understand that when we receive the US written response to all of our proposals.”                                                                    With up to 100,000 Russian soldiers and tanks massed on its border with Ukraine, US president Joe Biden warned this week that Moscow could invade Ukraine at short notice.Ahead of the Geneva meeting, following protest from Kyiv, Mr Biden retracted a remark that appeared to link the severity of sanctions Russia would face to the scale of any incursion into Ukrainian territory.In Geneva, Mr Blinken said the president was “fully prepared” to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin again – either again in Geneva, elsewhere or via video conference.“If we conclude, and the Russians conclude, that the best way to resolve things is through further conversation . . . then we’re certainly prepared to do that,” added the US chief diplomat.Written demandsHe also repeated that the US and its Nato allies would not meet a key Russian demand to block alliance access to Ukraine and other would-be members.Russian officials said on Friday that their written demands to the US will include a guarantee that Nato troops would leave Romania and Bulgaria, alliance members since 2004 and, before that, members of the defunct Warsaw Pact and the Soviet sphere of influence.After a further week of high-end diplomacy – in Geneva, Berlin and Kyiv – Nato general secretary Jens Stoltenberg invited Moscow to send officials to a second meeting of the Nato-Russia council to hear the alliance’s detailed plans on arms control, including intermediate missiles and cyberwarfare.On Friday UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said the Kremlin had “not learned the lessons of history” and warned of a post-invasion “terrible quagmire and loss of life, as we know from the Soviet-Afghan war and the conflict in Chechnya”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily

access smart speakers smart","story":"An outage caused Alexa smart speakers across the UK to go down leaving homeowners unable to switch on lights or control thermostats.Thousands of the Amazon devices, which people use to control internet-connected smart appliances in their homes, cut out on Friday morning.The tech giant said the fault was rapidly fixed but declined to explain what caused the mysterious blackout.The incident highlighted the vulnerability of so-called smart homes that increasingly rely on the internet to run everyday devices and household functions.Smart speakers are one of the most popular devices in the fast grown smart home sector.They are controlled by a series of voice commands that allow users to play music, set timers for cooking or answer basic questions, such as what the weather forecast is.They are also the focal point for other smart devices such as internet-connected lights and kettles, which can be switched on and off by voice commands.Amazon’s Alexa is one of the most popular smart speakers, having sold more than 100 million devices worldwide.According Downdetector, a website which records internet outages, more than 8,000 reports of Alexa problems were recorded by 8am on Friday.Users of the smart speaker soon took to social media to complain of the havoc the blackout was causing in their homes.Another Twitter user, Henry Elliss, from Reading, complained: “Not the best day to live in a house where the lights, radio, music and thermostat are all controlled by Alexa”.Other users joked that they were having to relearn how to turn lights and other household appliances such as kettles on manually again.Many users also said that they had woken up late or overslept as Alexa is often used as an alarm clock.Amazon said the fault behind the outage was resolved by mid-morning on Friday.A spokesman said: “This morning we had an issue that impacted some Alexa customers’ ability to interact with the service. The Alexa service is now operating normally.”However, the tech giant declined to comment on what caused the fault. Amazon has previously been accused of being opaque about how its Alexa operates amid privacy fears over how much data it records.In 2019, the company came under criticism after it emerged that Amazon staff listened to select recordings of users\u0027 voices.At the time, Amazon said that its staff only listened to “extremely small samples of Alexa voice recordings” to “improve the customer experience”.Yet, doubts have persisted over how much data the devices, which are always listening for commands unless they are purposely switched off, collect and store.MPs have previously been warned by experts that the legal framework around some smart speakers is so complex it is unclear what interactions they are allowed to record and share with their parent companies.In 2020, Dr. Jiahong Chen, an expert in IT Law at University of Nottingham, said the legal uncertainty meant he did not have a smart speaker in his own home.Speaking to MPs on the culture select committee, the academic said: “I just don’t feel the necessity and I don’t feel comfortable having a smart speaker that might potentially record everything I talk about or all the conversations I have with my guests.More from NewsI’m going nowhere, says Scotland’s first black professor amid ‘racist gang’ slur at scholarsPhysicists crack Wordle code ... but it may not spell the end of the funA ban on conservatories is exactly the sort of idiocy that could finish off Boris and ‘net zero’Hospital patients put up in £300 per night hotels amid record bed-blockingMeetings, briefings and tea room talking: How Tory leadership manoeuvres have already begunJail the social media chiefs who allow terror material online, demands watchdogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"physicists crack wordle code may not spell end fun","story":"There are many approaches to solving a Wordle game. Some players of the wildly popular word-guessing game start with whichever five-letter word first comes into their head. Others make tactical use of words containing common letters.A small number of Wordle fans, however, have found another route to the answers – but are respecting the game’s “code of silence” by keeping the solutions private. Two computing experts who met at the University of Cambridge are among those to have discovered that the code underpinning the Wordle webpage contains each day’s solution, from “cigar” on June 19, 2021, to … well, that would be telling.Dr Ramsey Faragher, a bye-fellow at Queen’s College and the founder of a tech company that specialises in smartphone positioning, tipped off his friend and former student Dr Sam Gregson, a former Large Hadron Collider physicist who is now a comedian and science commentator. As Dr Faragher predicted, Dr Gregson found the list of answers within the webpage’s source code.“It certainly seems to be the case that there is an informal code of silence and a great deal of community spirit in the Wordle community,” Dr Gregson said. “Few seem to want to share or broadcast the readily available answers and those that do are met with gentle hostility or eye-rolling silence.”Dr Gregson, 38, is using the information he and Dr Faragher, 39, have unearthed to craft an analysis of optimal Wordle strategy for his video channel, The Bad Boy of Science. Bad boy though he may be, Dr Gregson does not wish to crimp others’ enjoyment of the game. As such, he is cagey about publicly revealing the list of answers.Appropriately for a game whose integrity is so highly valued, Wordle has innocent origins. Designed by Welsh-born software engineer Josh Wardle to entertain his puzzle-loving wife, Wordle was a simple online game whose players – the two of them – sought to guess a five-letter word in six attempts.Then it went viral. Having had 90 players on November 1 last year, Wordle reached 2.7 million last week. Along the way, many of its players began to use mathematics to devise the most effective opening plays possible, with little-known words such as “roate” – an obsolete variant of “rote” – catapulted back into the English lexicon.The informal omerta has not been universally observed. Jill Sutcliffe, a moderator on a large Facebook group of Wordle aficionados, says that upcoming answers have been posted on two occasions. Mrs Sutcliffe, a retired courts worker who lives in Fife, swiftly deleted the offending posts, saving the group’s 9000-odd members from having their daily Wordle session ruined. “It was awful,” she said, “because once you see the answers you can’t unsee them. But mostly people are respectful.”The  has verified the list but will not spoil the game by revealing the answers. Should you doubt Drs Gregson and Faragher, though, check Sunday’s answer against an unusual five-letter word, beginning with C, used earlier in this article.More from NewsI’m going nowhere, says Scotland’s first black professor amid ‘racist gang’ slur at scholarsA ban on conservatories is exactly the sort of idiocy that could finish off Boris and ‘net zero’Hospital patients put up in £300 per night hotels amid record bed-blockingMeetings, briefings and tea room talking: How Tory leadership manoeuvres have already begunJail the social media chiefs who allow terror material online, demands watchdogIf you make students wear masks, we’ll get the lawyers involved, parents warn headteachersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"railway union not board government face mask plans","story":"A railway union is demanding face masks remain mandatory on board trains, despite the Government’s plans to return to normal. The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) said it wanted to ensure that train staff “continue to feel they are protected” when the so-called Plan B Covid restrictions expire next Thursday. It comes after Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, announced that passengers must continue to wear masks on London’s buses, trains and trams after the legal requirements end. Many rail operators have yet to make clear what their policy on masks will be from next week, raising fears commuters will again be left facing conflicting advice on different services.It follows scenes of high farce last summer when mask requirements for public transport were first lifted.Passengers at stations such as Farringdon found the rules changed in the short walk from one platform to the next, as face coverings were required on London Underground trains but not services run by Thameslink, which also called at the station.On the Government’s plans to end the Plan B measures, Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of TSSA said: “It’s vital our brave transport members who have been on the frontline of this pandemic continue to feel they are protected.It’s also important we do all that is reasonable to get people back onto public transport in London and elsewhere so that we can build a clean, green recovery from this virus. “Sadiq Khan is spot on when he says face coverings should remain beyond the end of Plan B, especially given the rates of infection we are still seeing. Clearly the Government should back this, not only for London but across the rest of our public transport network.” Ministers have spent the last few days battling with unions amid ongoing resistance to their plan to restore normality.Headteachers, backed by teachers’ unions, are preparing to defy efforts by the Education Secretary to end the requirement for face masks in the classroom at “all

sewer” because treatment plants are overwhelmed, with more than half unable to cope with demand from local homes and business, analysis shows.Of the 90 sewage works in the upper Thames, 46 don’t have enough capacity to deal with demand from local homes and businesses, a report has found.The Oxford Rivers Improvement Campaign (ORIC) analysed data supplied by Thames Water to work out how much sewage its treatment works could process and whether it was enough to handle demand from local homes and businesses.They said the data showed that the company’s failure to invest in upgrading its systems over recent decades was the cause of sewage leaks which has left the river polluted for wildlife, swimmers and rowers.Thames Water is among water companies that have come under fire in recent months for dumping untreated sewage into rivers and the sea thousands of times.It came as a video released by the BBC appeared to show sewage coming out of a pipe at Cassington sewage works, one of those covered by the study.ORIC data suggest Cassington has 74 per cent of the capacity it needs to process sewage correctly.A spokesman for Thames Water said the plant had not released untreated sewage since March last year.“Any problem seems to be occurring in the long pipe that takes the treated effluent to the river.“We are determined to understand what is coming out of the final effluent pipe and we have taken further samples as part of our examination,” she said.Not one of Britain’s rivers passes chemical pollution standards, and this week Britain’s only designated river swimming spot, in Ilkley, Yorkshire, was classified as “poor” after water quality tests showed it is heavily polluted with bacteria.British sewage systems are designed to discharge untreated sewage into rivers and the sea when the volume becomes too great for them to process.This is only supposed to happen at times of exceptionally heavy rainfall, but the analysis suggests that some of the treatment plants are also unable to cope with normal or dry weather.The group’s analysis, seen by the , shows that Oxford’s sewage treatment works had 61 per cent of the capacity it needs, while Swindon’s had 86 per cent and Banbury’s had just 43 per cent.Mark Hull, a former water industry consultant and co-author of the report, said: “Our detailed modelling shows that half the sewage works in the upper Thames do not have enough capacity they are not fit for purpose.“We believe this is typical of the whole river Thames, and indeed many if not most rivers in England.“Thames Water has taken customers’ money for treating our sewage, but not invested nearly enough to keep pace with the growth of housing.“Our rivers have returned to being open sewers and sewage treatment works.”A typical upper Thames sewage treatment works “discharges untreated sewage for around 500 hours a year”, the report says.“The rises in demand were predicted twenty years ago and should have been taken into account in water companies’ investment plans for this century,” it adds.A spokesman for Thames Water said: “We regard all discharges of untreated sewage as unacceptable and will work with the Government, Ofwat and the Environment Agency to accelerate work to stop them being necessary.“We have an unprecedented amount of investment directed towards safeguarding our rivers and streams.“Between 2020 and 2025 we are spending £1.25 billion on maintaining and improving our operational sites, including contributing to the health of 745km of rivers across London and the Thames Valley.“We’re increasing sewage treatment capacity at our sewage works in the area, including Oxford, Witney, Fairford and Ampney St Peter, and we’re also committed to continuing our industry-leading trial to provide real-time alerts of sewage discharges around Oxford in 2022.”More from NewsPhysicists crack Wordle code ... but it may not spell the end of the funA ban on conservatories is exactly the sort of idiocy that

We might kid ourselves that Ukraine is a long way away, but that’s exactly what people said about Czechoslovakia in 1938. Time to get real.Here’s what we’re up against, and it’s chilling. Putin has declared the breakup of the Soviet Union to be the greatest disaster of the 20th century. And he’s clearly determined to see that put right, with the subjugation of Ukraine the first step.  Already, by pouncing on Crimea, he’s seized over 7 per cent of Ukraine’s territory, shrugging off sanctions. Does anyone seriously think that’s where his ambitions end?We can be sure the people of Ukraine won\u0027t take a Russian invasion lying down. Anyone whose visited Ukraine to speak to its political leaders in recent years, and I’ve had that privilege on several occasions, will know that Ukrainians will fight to the last to defend their country. In a recent poll, 30 per cent of Ukrainians said they would take up arms to fight. That’s a staggering 13 million people. And many millions more will resist in other ways. We will fight to the last bullet and last drop of blood, said one battle-hardened soldier on the frontline of the frozen war in Ukraine\u0027s East.Putin’s forces may be superior, but if he thinks the tanks can just roll into Kyiv, he’ll be much mistaken. There is no such thing, as Joe Biden mistakenly suggested, as a minor ‘incursion’ into sovereign territory. It will be bloody and brutal. Tens of thousands of lives will surely be lost, many of them Russian.Which brings us to the EU. What the hell is it playing at? In umming and ahing about whether a confrontation will weaken inidual member economies, the organisation is putting its own selfish interests ahead of what’s right. President Macron says Europe must open its own dialogue with Russia, separate from America’s and NATO’s. This is precisely what Putin craves: a ided, disunited West. And what on earth is Macron’s idea of a “security and stability pact” between Russia and the EU? If that isn’t appeasement, I don’t know what is, and it leaves the Ukrainians rightly afraid that their future might be decided without their own say. It’s all too redolent of great powers treating countries like pawns on a chess board.Anyone with an ounce of knowledge about Putin and the Kremlin knows full well that Russia only respects strength. Weasel words and lily-livered compromise will be a red rag to the Russian bull. Anything less than complete Western unity will be fatal for Ukraine, and terrifying for other countries close to Russia’s self-styled ‘near abroad’, from Finland in the north to Georgia in the south.Thank goodness Britain knows better, and Ukraine sees us as one of its closest friends – a country that punches well above its weight in Kyiv in terms of influence and power. Already, the UK has sent new weapons system to Ukraine, and troops to provide training, in marked contrast to Germany, which refuses to do any such thing. Ukraine doesn’t expect British and American troops on the ground. As her Minister of Defence, Oleksiy Reznikov said, “Just give us the weapons we need to defend ourselves, we will do our own fighting”.This isn’t just about Ukraine, but about democracy, sovereignty, the right of people to determine their own future without being bullied and then subjugated. In short, it’s about freedom – something that 40 million Ukrainians have learned to love, and which the West is privileged enough to take for granted. Britain and America realise this. Others appear not to. Time is running out for the EU to stay on the right side of history.More from NewsI’m going nowhere, says Scotland’s first black professor amid ‘racist gang’ slur at scholarsPhysicists crack Wordle code ... but it may not spell the end of the funA ban on conservatories is exactly the sort of idiocy that could finish off Boris and ‘net zero’Hospital patients put up in £300 per night hotels amid record bed-blockingMeetings, briefings and tea room talking: How Tory leadership manoeuvres have already begunJail the social media chiefs who allow terror material online, demands watchdogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street party before philip","story":"Downing Street party before Philip funeral ran to am with guests using Wilfs slideBoris Johnson apologised to the Queen this week over the events, which he said he deeply and bitterly regrettedthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-looks-down-during-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ZJOMpek,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The night before, officials danced while drinking wine in plastic cups, ordered takeaway pizza and tried out Boris Johnsonaposs son Wilfaposs slide, according to The .Government guidance at the time warned: “You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble. “You can meet outdoors, including in gardens, in groups of six people or two households.  Boris Johnson has apologised to the Queen for the events, which he said he deeply and bitterly regretted.The Prime Minister was not at either event as he was at his Chequers country retreat, No  said when the events were first reported last week. The latest details come as the PM was battling to save his premiership, with plans to spend the weekend at Chequers trying to win over his mutinous MPs. Officials allegedly took part in a seven-hour drinking session at two separate dos to say farewell to Boris Johnsonaposs top spin doctor and a Downing Street photographer. Theclaims to have obtained a picture of staff in the Downing Street basement, where people were drinking wine and spirits out of plastic cups.  Text messages also indicate that attendees were still partying at am, having started at around pm. The existence of photos and texts could provide further fuel for Sue Grayaposs partygate inquiry, which is expected to be published next week. One of the events was for James Slack, the PMaposs departing director of communications, which was held in the press area and then the garden. He has apologised for the bash. He said in a statement: “This event should not have happened at the time that it did. I am deeply sorry, and take full responsibility.”  The second event for a photographer, which was held in the basement, where an adviser alleged acted as a DJ using a laptop. Wine was reportedly spilled on a printer where the laptop was blaring music out. The events reportedly merged when they eventually moved to the garden, where it is alleged that some attendees went down a childaposs slide belonging to the PMaposs son Wilf. It was previously claimed that Wilfaposs swing had been broken by guests. Mr Johnson appeared visibly distressed when he told reporters that he had apologised to the Queen over the parties. I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened, he told reporters this week. I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.aposapos The revelations about the parties last week sparked a major backlash, compounding the Prime Ministeraposs woes as he battles for his own survival. The claim that an aide was dispatched to the Co-op supermarket on The Strand to fill a suitcase with wine was widely mocked. Last week, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning. No  has apologised to the Palace.

Last week, they opposed Labour’s plans to stop anti-vax protests threatening teachers and children outside schools. This week, they tried to bring in powers to stop and search anyone in a peaceful protest. Instead of taking sensible action to keep people safe, they are targeting peaceful protestors and bystanders. It’s a mess. Stronger action is clearly needed to protect schools and vaccine clinics from threatening anti-vax groups. Children shouldn’t face intimidation on the way into school and NHS staff shouldn’t face threats or abuse on the way into work, especially when their job is saving lives. There have also been recent reports that one group has been doing combat training. That’s why Labour put forward proposals to offer councils fast-track powers to set up protection zones around schools and vaccine clinics. People have a right to protest but they don’t have a right to intimidate others, especially children. Shockingly, the Conservatives voted against those proposals.  Labour also supported stronger action against dangerous demonstrations on motorways like the irresponsible Insulate Britain protests last year. Someone could have been killed. No one has a right to put lives at risk, so Labour Lords voted this week for stronger sentences for protests on motorways and A-roads. The police and courts also already have many existing powers to deal with serious disruption from protests and we called for better guidance and training for police on how they should be used. But instead of focusing on protests that are threatening, violent or put other people’s safety at risk, the Government is trying to silence peaceful protesters. Under their plans, peaceful protestors objecting to the closure of a local swimming pool or maternity unit could be stopped and searched by police for no reason at all. Anyone passing by a protest, to get to work, or to take a child to school, could also be stopped and searched without suspicion. Protestors could also be stopped for being noisy. We know that this Tory Government doesn’t like being challenged, but potentially criminalising people just for singing or chanting undermines Britain’s important freedoms and rights.  Rightly, the House of Lords voted against these plans this week. From the suffragettes to the Countryside Alliance, people have always had a right to object publicly to things that governments or big corporations do, whether ministers like it or not. Throughout history, it is how some of our important freedoms have been won. The Conservatives are giving us the worst of all worlds - trying to silence peaceful protesters, but not taking action on anti-vaxxers intimidating children. They need to think again. Labour’s contract with the British people has respect and security at its heart. That means respecting Britainaposs long-standing democratic traditions and standing up for public safety and security at the same time.

Boris Johnson chose to ignore this when he announced a blanket lting of Plan B restrictions this week.The sensible course would have been to maintain our guard until the threat posed by Omicron had subsided in every region. The Prime Minister is not being driven by the data – despite his repeated claims – but by politically expediency. Many believe he rushed into it because his job is on the line and he needs to curry favour with his backbenchers. It is entirely in keeping with Johnson’s behaviour that he has put his own interests ahead of those of the country. By continuing to wear masks the public are showing better judgment than those making the rules. Game to act There are few more sickening trades than trophy hunting. Killing endangered animals is not a sport but a heartless act of barbarity. So it is depressing to read that big game hunting is still big business in the US. The annual Safari Club International Convention in Las Vegas offers bloodthirsty Americans the chance to spend tens of thousands of dollars to slaughter wild animals. The UK government has pledged action on trophy hunting but has so far failed to bring in the necessary legislation. There is no reason for this delay.

He adds that when Tory politicians need to woo the populist vote they threaten to make the BBC pay for itselfCan you imagine this lot filling our BBC TV schedules opinionByBrian Reade:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan As far as the right is concerned the BBC has always been the Great Distractor. When foreign-based newspaper barons want to rail against the evils of liberal elites they home in on the leftie BBC. When Tory politicians need to woo the populist vote they threaten to make the Bloated Beeb pay for itself.The last time Boris Johnson played this hand was during the  General Election when he was attacked for refusing, while on-screen, to look at a Daily Mirror front page showing a sick four-year-old on an AE floor. Within hours he was threatening to scrap the TV licence.And now, as he sups in the Last Chance Saloon, he’s sent out his pom-pom swinging fangirl Nadine Dorries to tell BBC bosses she has their testicles in a vice. That’s the laughably titled culture secretary who believes taxpayers fund Channel  and probably thinks Lord Reith is something a peer lays at the Cenotaph.  Tories like to pretend they are in favour of public service broadcasting, so long as it can be bent to their will. But what would it look likethey ran the stripped-down BBC today. Here, I’m guessing, would be the highlights: the day opens with a recording of Vera Lynn singing God Save The Queen and is followed by Wake-Up Don’t Woke-Up presented by Esther McVey in the Downing Street TV studio with Julia Hartley-Brewer reviewing all papers except the Mirror and . CBeebies’ flagship show is Watch With Nanny in which Jacob Rees-Mogg’s nanny plays the penny whistle as his children, dressed in naval unorm, recite important dates from the Napoleonic Wars. Antiques Roadshow is revamped, with Bernard Ingham catching up with the latest views from local Conservative associations. As is Upstairs, Downstairs in which Rishi Sunak tells us what it’s like to live in a stately home during an energy crisis and how to cut off the heating in the servants’ quarters. On The Travel Show, Mark Francois lists things to do when stuck in three-hour passport queues in Europe due to Brexit, and Dominic Raab gives tips on how to ignore your mobile while relaxing on a Corfu sunbed as Kabul falls. In Flog It! think-tanks update us on ways to privatise the NHS and EastEnders becomes WestEnders, a story of First World problems in Fulham and Cha. On Jobsearch, Nadine Dorries herself explains how you can get your daughters on the public payroll and Matt Hancock shows how to give multi-million pound contracts to the bloke down the pub. Grandstand s with polo, croquet and fox-hunting with a shower of Berkeley Hunts, and foodies are served Truss’s Kitchen Nightmares, where the foreign secretary advises on how to cope when you run out of British cheese. There’s Dragons’ Den Does Dover in which Priti Patel hears contestants pitch new ways to repel migrants and Hospital will show the NHS in a fresh light, with no AE queues and staff delighted with their workload. Comedy-wise there’s Mock The Weak in which Jim Davidson and Roy Chubby Brown openly humiliate minorities, and Would I Lie To You  sees Boris Johnson do a weekly press conference. And each day closes at midnight with Land of Dope and Tory played from a model of the new royal yacht. Unless you’ve put your foot through your telly hours before and gone to bed, that is.

His comments came as senior Tory William Wragg claimed rebels had been intimidated by party enforcers into toeing the party line. No  said: We are not aware of any evidence to support what are clearly serious allegations. If there is any evidence to support these claims we would look at it very carefully.But Mr Wakeford told the BBC : “I was threatened that I would not get the school for RadclfeI did not vote in one particular way.This is a town that’s not had a high school for the best part of  years.” It is understood that the vote was about a Labour motion to back Marcus Rashfordaposs free school meals campaign. The Red Wall Tory dramatically joined the Labour benches moments before PMQs on Wednesday.But what do his constituents in Bury South think  Why should we have to suffer because of their greed and hunger for power  Waliko Banda, a care worker from Radclfe, said he was horried to learn Mr Wakefordaposs school funding was threatenedhe didnapost back the Prime Minister. Iaposve got a three-month-old baby, and to think that his chances will be scuppered because of party politics is sickening, the -year-old said.  Why should we have to suffer because of their greed and hunger for power  I canapost agree and support a party that would do that to one of their own. What does that mean for the rest of us  He said he will struggle to choose a politician to back at the next election. Tories are acting like kindergarten childrenChristina Horner, , said shewill stick with voting for Keir Starmer at the next General Election.Ms Horner, from Stockport, said: I think the Tories are acting like kindergarten children. The Conservatives are hardly professional politicians.  I wish theyaposd focus on working people and poorer families.The Conservative Party always pretends to care, but itaposs clear they have no interests in anything apart from making their own pockets bigger.We saw it in the pandemic. Somehow the rich got richer. How does that level up the country  I want to know whataposs happening with the economy - not partiesGordon White, , retired from Radclfe, said:Iaposm sick and tired of hearing about these parties.I want to know whataposs happening with the economy. He had a party, so what! Is that going to solve the cost of living crisis  No. He got us through Covid, heaposs given us Brexit.I want to hear more about the good things he has in store for this country, not some unfounded allegations. Let politicians govern. Boris Johnson is toying with the country Marc Eulett, an accountant from Radclfe, said: Iaposve voted for the Conservatives and Labour in my letime. The -year-old said: Iaposve always been a swing voter but the latest party allegations have really done it for me. Boris Johnson is toying with the country. I canapost say Iaposm shocked but I feel embarrassed for us all, working people of this country. I wonapost say who Iaposve voted for but the next election will be tough. Sadly I do believe heaposll be able to walk away from these accusations as he does with most things. I still canapost believe a word he says Audrey Jolly, , from Radclfe is still unsureshe will vote Labour at the next election, having swung her normal Labour vote to back Mr Johnson at the  election. But Alison Jolly, , believes the Conservatives are unable to take care of the country. I thought Boris handled Covid really well but then the party allegations came out. I mean heaposs had such a rough start. Heaposs had Covid and heaposs got two little children. Itaposs been hard for him and heaposs doing the best he can.The fact that Dominic Cummings is coming out of the woodwork to try and accuse the PM of doing things, just says it all to be honest. But I still canapost believe a word he says because heaposs not being straightforward. To be honest my dad will be turning in his gravehe knew I voted Conservatives, and Boris has let me down. Alison said the Conservatives are behaving in a pathetic manner. Swanning off and having parties while the Queen was forced to bury her husband alone  What about the people who have lost loved ones to Covid  Itaposs not right at all and Iaposve had enough. I am so sick and tired of this Government. The fact that Mr Wakeford had to leave the party he was elected in says it all.

Marc Spaganuolo has spent the last  years struggling to control his bowels and his bladder - but stayed quiet about his condition because he was embarrassed. But now heaposs started making TikTok videos to let other people with incontinence know theyaposre not alone. Marc, , suffers from a degenerative nerve condition called peripheral neuropathy, meaning his brain doesnapost receive signals when the bladder and bowel are full. First suffering from incontinence when he was , he went through years of tests before finally getting his diagnosis when he was  years old.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Currently looking for love, Marc is even open and honest about his condition on his dating profile - claiming most people are open and understanding about it. He said: It started with bed wetting. I tried to hide it and blamed it on my dog at first. My dog was elderly so I got away with that for a few months. Eventually, my dad found out and said aposWe need to take you to the doctorapos. I didnapost want to go, but my dad was saying it could be a urinary tract infection. That convinced me. It was embarrassment that stopped me wanting to go. It wasnapost like it was happening every night, it was sporadic at first. Here and there. Now itaposs daily. At first, Marc was told heaposd grow out of the condition, but as time went on, it became clear that wasnapost the case.  After a while of living with the condition, he discovered protective underwear, which he now wears daily. I believe in being upfront about it. I feel like those terminologies created a ide in my mind and kept me from dealing with it. Itaposs a diaper, letaposs own it, he said. To go through this as a teenager was an isolating experience. Over time, I would tell a person here and person there, my courage would grow. It was a decade long process of telling people here and there. It was hard to define a specic point where I got confident, but I want people to feel confident in talking about it. For Marc, the ultimate show of confidence was when he set up the TikTok account. Using the alias aposThe Diaper Dynamoapos, Marc explains how incontinence affects his day-to-day le and how he deals with aposself-diaperingapos.  Now, one of Marcaposs challenges is the world of dating - but his condition throws up problems. He said: One of the biggest challenges of my le is dating, because itaposs been such a gradual process for me to get to where I am now. But of course, Iaposd love to meet somebody. But through his TikTok, heaposs hoping to tap into a community and provide support to those who need it. He said: I started my TikTok in September . I knew people needed help with this stuff, and it took off from there. TikTokaposs algorithm was really good at finding people who needed this content. Marc now has , followers on the , with most people offering him support about his condition. Itaposs been a pretty wild ride, itaposs been eye opening in a few dferent ways, he said. But putting myself out there on TikTok and seeing the overwhelming amount of love and support made me realise I need to put myself out there and give people a chance to respond.  Itaposs been so many years that Iaposve been living with this and Iaposve gotten so used to talking about it in my everyday le that I knew showing this would be a big deal to helping people. This is a really common issue and thereaposs a reason why these products are made. Explaining incontinence affects between  and  million people around the world, he said parents have thanked him for his honesty, saying itaposs helped their children. I feel incredibly honoured when parents say my videos helped their kid. It sometimes brings a tear to my eye, he said. It wasnapost where I was intending to go with the content, but the fact that it has an impact on them is great. One woman said she showed it to her six-year-old and she responded aposIaposm not a freakapos. Thataposs the point. Evenyou have to live this way for the rest of your le, you can still find happiness and be who you want to be. Due to the unpredictable nature of his condition, Marc makes sure heaposs always prepared and keeps spare nappies and wipes to hand to clear up any accidents. He said: I keep diapers in a backpack, along with wipes. It depends where Iaposm going and what Iaposm doing, of course. I prefer and recommend diapers because Iaposve heard so many horror stories about catheters and stomas. I just think aposwhy go through that when I can manage with a diaper apos If Iaposm at a social event, I tend to be more discreet about it. I still get self-conscious from time to time. When I used to work in an office, Iaposd change midday in a private restroom.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcWhile not everyone is kind about Marcaposs condition, many viewers of his videos are supportive.

Luke and Lachlan - originally from Adelaide, Australia - are desperate to get their own place after being kept apart during the pandemic, He said: We were separated during Covid, he was in America while I was here, we were forced apart.

Kylie Thomas, , and husband David, , hired Mark Jones, , to build a new room at the rear of their family home last year. The single-storey addition to the property near Stafford, West Midlands, was priced at £, and was supposed to take a fortnight. But months later, the coupleaposs garden still contains a roofless wreck - leaving them feeling stupid and out of pocket. Shocking pictures show half-built brick walls and materials strewn across a muddy patch of ground. A packed green skip overflowing with debris and buckets has been left outside the front of the Staffordshire property.  Kylie and David, who have two children, said Mark asked for money upfront but then went off the radar. And the pair claim that, since the ordeal, they have been told that he wasn’t qualied to do the promised work - and has been involved in similar situations previously. But, when challenged, Mark says he contracted out the work to others - who let him down. Nurse Kylie said: This was a horrendous experience. It sapped our time, money, and energy and left us feeling stupid and upset.  We both work very hard - we worked all through the pandemic. Heaposs taken our money and ruined our garden, and left us with a wreck. When he asked for money I paid it, because it was getting colder and darker and I was worried the work wouldn’t get finishedI didn’t. We knew building materials were running low in the country, so we were really understanding about it.  Kylie and David hired Mark, the director of Chase Home Solutions, to build onto the sitting room of their s townhouse last year. They say he first visited the family home at the end of July and quoted them £,. That cost would cover a three-by-three metre squared pitched roof extension and the replacement of windows in two upstairs rooms, it was said. Kylie said she was impressed by Mark, so signed him up for the job - which he said would take a fortnight.  They scheduled the building work to start on September , and agreed the windows would be replaced beforehand. Kylie says she repeatedly asked about planning permission and building regulations, but Mark said not to worry - because he would sort everything. The trader then asked for £, upfront, with a further £, agreed for when the extension reached roof height.  The next £, would be paid when the roof went on, it was decided, and the final £, when the building had all the electricity in and passed regulations. Kylie says she made the first payment on August  and, when Mark then asked for another £, on August , she paid again. But the builders didnapost show up on the start day - as they were still on another job, according to Mark. And the day after he said they couldnapost come because there was a problem with the skip. Two men finally appeared on September , holding shovels and pushing a wheelbarrow - but claiming Mark had refused to pay for a digger.  Kylie said a bricklayer then arrived and said the extension had not been measured correctly - meaning the couple would have to extend another . metres across the house. This prompted Mark to ask for another £, for the bigger extension, which was paid. But it took the workers a further two weeks to dig and concrete the foundations - because they only showed up for a maximum of four hours a day, Kylie claims. She said: “They told my neighbour they were worked into the ground on ours and working other jobs. They would do a little bit then say they had to go, often they blamed it on the weather.I never saw any materials stored at our property. The lads brought small amounts in the boot of their car. I think he was taking them from other projects. He said he kept them in a lockup, but much later his son told me he didnapost have one. Kylie then paid Mark another £, on September , and another on October . But, by then, the lads were only managing a couple of hours every few days - and Kylie was feeling desperate. She told Mark she felt he had done them over, and he replied that they were having a few problems. The builders never showed again - so Kylie asked for her money back on October . Mark replied to say heaposd call her later and theyaposd work all weekend on her house, she said. But his call never came, and Kylie says that when she now dials the number she used to contact Mark a message says the phone is switched off. Since then, six builders have looked at Kylie’s extension and agree it doesnapost meet building regulations, she said. They say it need to be torn down and should not have amounted to no more than five days effort, it is claimed.  Kylie also alleges that she and David then went to Markaposs flat on October , where a man - estimated to be in his s and calling himself Markaposs son - answered the door. She said: “I explained what had happened and he didn’t know what to do with himself. He said, ‘oh god, not that againapos.Kylie posted on a local Facebook chat and five other families came forward with similar stories.This has been incredibly stressful, she said. Itaposs such a mess, and we donapost have loads of money. People need to be aware that there are cowboys like him out there. Thereaposs no way we could have known - he seemed so professional. I wouldnapost pay all that money upfront again. Every business should have enough in the account to buy materials. When confronted with Kylieaposs claims, Mark said: “During the pandemic I put £, of my own money into starting a building business. I sub-contracted the work and paid them in advance. One build failed an inspection, and another was completely incorrect. It snowballed on social media very quickly. Kylie was one of my customers and I apologised to her mother and offered to put her work right, but they wouldn’t let me. I lost all the contracts and have been left with £, debt and my company is not viable. I really feel for Kylie. The builders have let everyone down. Both have changed their phone numbers and one has closed down his business.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mark Jones\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job.

Care worker Lorraine King, , and her kids have had to wash themselves with hot water from a kettle since their home in West London was damaged by a leak.She told MyLondon: I’ve got to either boil the kettle or even go and take a bath at my daughter’s which is miles away. It’s not convenient.Lorraine, who works in care, said her home, owned by the Catalyst Housing association, has flooded at least once a year since she moved in. She said: It’s happened in the front room three times and also the bedroom, bathroom, toilet. It’s just constant. -  She said the latest incident happened on Boxing Day, when water flooded through the ceiling of her front room where her granddaughter was playing. Lorraine lives with her son and two daughters and they are still waiting for their home to be fixed and claims sheaposs had no advice on when it will be sorted.She also said multiple maintenance workers have come to the property since but no one has fixed the issue and there seems to be poor communication across the company.  She added: The repairs take extra long to do. The guy left us with no hot water or heating. Then they contacted me two weeks later and told me they weren’t aware we didn’t have any heating. They gave us these little oil heaters, which don’t heat up the room at all. The whole house really does smell because of the flood. According to Lorraine, someone came to look at the problem weeks later and turned the electricity back on within a few hours another leak happened.  She said: The whole thing was flooded. There was no advice. I’ve still got no heating or hot water. Every contractor who comes says they don’t know anything about it and they’ve just come to assess it. Clearly they’re not communicating. Lorraine said she is worried a family member could be electrocuted because of the damp conditions and the stress of the repeated leaks is affecting her mental health. She said: It’s happened so much, I’m now having mental health issues and I never had this before I moved into the property. On Saturday, I had a total meltdown because I just couldn’t handle it any more and I’ve still got to come into work. I can’tproperly because I don’t feel myself.  Lorraine says she was on the housing waiting list for  years before she moved into her first permanent home in Kensington and Cha in . But she said the new build has had so many defects she almost cannot stand to live there any more. She said: Eventhey repair it I’m not comfortable in that property because I’ll decorate it and it’ll be ruined again. A spokesperson for Catalyst said: “We are sorry for the inconvenience and distress caused. We believe the source of the current problem is a leaking communal heating pipe in Ms King’s ceiling. To permanently fix the pipe, we need to take down the ceiling, and we are speaking with Ms King to arrange for adequate access to her home and enough time to complete the work and replace and redecorate her ceiling.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mental healthFloodspovertyHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lton Parish Council has written to residents about the complaints of aposDarkey Laneapos and have askedthey want to change it or not. If residents choose to rename the road, it would be the responsibility of West Devon Borough Councilwhich would then do their own consultationa desire for change was expressed, DevonLive reports. The letter from January  reads: I have been asked to write to you on behalf of Lton Parish Council following receipt of a complaint about the street name Darkey Lane made by two visitors to the village. What do you think about this story  Let us know in the comments below  The visitors, one of who is of Caribbean heritage, were shocked and extremely upset having been confronted with a name like this. Councillors took the decision at a parish council meeting on November , , to undertake a public consultation with you in early January , to find outyou would like to keep or change the existing road name. It went on to explain that to rename the road, two-thirds of households on Darkey Lane would have to be in agreement. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Furthermore,they wanted to change the name then each household would have to pay £ to WDBC. The parish council have offered to pay for replacement road signs. Residents on the road would also be required to tell utility companies and all professional and personal contacts regarding any new road name. In the same letter, the parish council gave historical context on how the road got its name. It said: Darkey Lane was a historic, locally-based road name given before development in the local area. The road had originally been a sunken and tree-lined dark lane. Over the years and with the use of local Devonshire dialect, it became known as Darkey Lane. Robert Fleming, the owner of Lton Hall Hotel, is in favour of changing the roadaposs name. He said: I agree that the name should be changed. I think historically that the lane may have been called Darke Lane in the old English spelling, as indeed the lane is very dark and tree covered in places. The fact that the word ‘darkey’ has negative connotations, and has and continues to be used as such, supersedes historical spellings where they may have had a dferent meaning. People may be offended so it should be changed as standard, with a minimum of fuss. Indeed as a hotelier in the area, we have had people actually mention their surprise at the name of the lane as it is quite close to us. When I moved here  years ago I remember being rather shocked at it as we had moved down from London and lived in a multi-racial area of East London. Lton can not by any stretch of the imagination be classed as multi-racial. For people objecting to the change, I thinkthey could imagine themselves as being in a minority of some sort and then have a derogatory work on a street name that affected  upset them it may garner a dferent response. The name could be just Darke Lane or even Dark Lane which is minimal effort. In this advanced age we live in it should be a simple matter to change all the databases etc, although people may decide to live with it as it means changing passport  drivers licences and so on which obviously will incur some costs. Lton Parish Council said the results of the consultation will be reported at its next meeting later this month on January .

These figures are subject to revision and are not necessarily what schools will actually receive, since they are based on pupil data from -.Use our interactive widget to explore this projected funding for your school - and see how this compares both locally and nationally:The Government has committed to giving schools an increase in their pupil-led funding of at least .% per pupil.However, this is below the Office for Budget Responsibility’s most recent inflation projection of .% - meaning nearly , state-funded schools are projected to see a real-terms cut in their funding.The figures also show that there are huge dferences in the amount of money state schools receive per pupil, even between those in the same area. These figures exclude specialist SEN schools, as these are funded dferently to other schools. It includes both maintained schools, which are overseen by the local authority, and academies, which operate independently and receive their funding directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency. Generally, funding is made up of a basic lump sum that all schools of that level are entitled to, plus funding on top of that based on the number of pupils, and extra money for pupils with additional needs - such as those living in deprivation. There are also other funding streams that relate to things like geographical isolation and expected growth in pupil numbers. The process was set to be formalised by , with all local authorities moving to the National Funding Formula, but as a result of signicant challenges, the Government has delayed its implementation. As such, local authorities currently decide how money is shared out between schools in its area, using its own funding formula based on DfE guidance.

He said: It’s entirely Brexit – you can’t blame it on anything  but Brexit,” said the driver, who has had to push back some deliveries. The Dover TAP, a temporary traffic system to prevent a build-up in lorry traffic, was brought in amid tailbacks. The TAP has also put in place a mph speed restriction for all vehicles approaching the port.

Estelle Wignall has stage four oian cancer which recently spread to her bowel and doctors have told her she is terminally ill.A mum to baby daughter, Brooke,  months, she has been offered palliative care.But Estelle insists she is up for the fight, and has launched a fundraising campaign through GoFundMe to seek treatment overseas.She says: “I feel as though I have been written off, but I am not ready to throw in the towel yet. I’ve bounced back before, and I am determined to do it again. To help Estelle raise money for treatment overseas, you can donate here. I want to celebrate my little girl’s second birthday, I want to see her start school, I want to mark as many milestones as I can.” Estelle, , from Wigan, Greater Manchester, was diagnosed with oian cancer five years ago after becoming tired and bloated. Doctors at first insisted she had IBS but her symptoms became so bad that she was rushed to hospital and then sent home again with medication. She said: “I picked up a leaflet in hospital about oian cancer and I immediately diagnosed myself. But everyone told me not to be so stupid because I was only  years old. “People said I was being a hypochondriac. Nobody took me seriously – but I just knew. It was an instinct.” Estelle pushed for tests and in February , she was finally diagnosed with grade one oian cancer. She had a tumour removed, along with her right oy and Fallopian tube. After making a full recovery, she put the cancer behind her, working as a receptionist and marrying soulmate Mike, , in June  in Texas. The couple had their first child, Brooke, in May . Estelle said: “I had only one oy and so to conceive so quickly felt like a miracle. I didn’t have my regular checks because I was pregnant, and during the birth the midwe actually noticed nodules on my cervix and I was referred for more tests, which came back clear. “We adored Brooke and the future looked fantastic.  “I was actually planning a hysterectomy so that there was no chance the cancer could .” But before her op, Estelle started to feel unwell, suffering from exhaustion and a lack of appetite. She said: “I had started the  week diet challenge, to get rid of my baby weight. I just needed to lose a stone, that was all. “But I started to feel very tired and I had no appetite. I thought it was all due to the diet – but it got worse and I began to think the cancer might be back.” In November , she was sent for urgent scans and was diagnosed with stage four cancer, which had spread to her liver and lungs.  She said: “I was devastated. The first time I had cancer, I coped well. But this time, because of Brooke, I was heartbroken. She was just six months old and it felt so cruel. I had only just started being a mum, and I didn’t want it to be taken away. She was initially told her le expectancy was only two or three years but her outlook improved after treatment and a raft of alternative therapies. “There have been points when I felt I could not go on. I considered euthanasia. But I kept going, and I got my spirits up again, she said. A recent scan showed the cancer has spread once again to the bowel and Estelle is now being warned that her time is fast running out. She says: “I’ve been on the brink before and I have bounced back and I am determined to do it again. I can’t give up, I have too much to live for, and I am determined to look for treatment abroad. “I hope also that my story can help other women, it is so important, no matter how young you are, to follow your instincts and to insist on answers.

The HMRC client advisor received treatment but repeatedly made attempts on her le. Lisa also drank up to six bottles of wine a day, had a four-week stint in a rehabilitation clinic and was assessed by healthcare professionals. She vowed she had beat her illness. On July , Lisaaposs boyfriend found her hanged at the home near Oldham, Greater Manchester following concerns for her welfare. Tests revealed she had so much alcohol in her bloodstream that she would have been almost three times the drink driving limit. Lisa had no health problems earlier in le.  She studied Leisure and Tourism at college worked and for a telecoms company before getting a job with HMRC. Linda Rees, her mum, said in a statement: She had a child with her partner but they split in  and it was a dficult time for Lisa. Lisa and her daughter moved in with me and I believed she suffered from delayed post-natal depression. Eventually Lisa moved out and her daughter moved in with her father although everyone was on good terms. During the time Lisa was living with me, I noticed she was drinking a lot more alcohol - up to six bottles of wine per day. Sadly it was to mask her depression. In  she went into rehab for four weeks but I donapost think it worked because she continued to drink. Linda continued: She was sectioned for one week and diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety and depression.  The heartbroken mum said: When she was not drinking, she seemed fine and happy. She talked about feeling suicidal in the  months prior to her death. She would say the only thing stopping her from taking her le was me and her daughter. On July , I rang Lisa and woke her up. Later, she texted and she made some comment askingmy sandwich was more important than her and I told her to grow up. The next morning you sent her a text message but got no response. Later I received a call about the sad news that Lisa had passed away. Danny Howarth, who had been dating Lisa since November , said: She worked from home and was at high risk due to her medical condition. She would have very good and bad days when she would feel trapped. She had had demons from past concerns with her mental health. She hated taking her medication and when she felt better, she would stop. Sometimes she was her own worst enemy. I kept a diary of how she was and she was a binge drinker and could drink one or two bottles of wine or vodka a day.  At times, she would make threats to take her own le. I once rushed to her aid and found her with a kne. But on the weekend before she died, we talked about getting a house together and going on holiday. On the day before it happened, she told me she had a run-in with her mother. She was emotional and told her mother she was feeling suicidal and that her mother told her to grow up. The following day I sent a text message but I started to panic when she had not replied by .pm. I arrived at the house at .pm to see her slumped over in the corner of the lounge. When police arrived at the house, they found ious packs of antidepressants going back to  which had barely been taken,at all. Officers also found an empty bottle of pink gin and a half-full bottle of vodka. She had  milligrams of alcohol per  millilitres of blood in her system. The alcohol limit for driving in blood is mg. Recording a conclusion of suicide coroner Matthew Cox said: Lisa had tried to stop drinking and when that happened she was fine and happy but sadly the occasions where she tried to stop were not successful. Her mother talked about her being suicidal prior to her death. It is clear that Lisa was responsible for taking her own le.

Like other Trusts nationally we are experiencing an extremely busy period in our Emergency Department and we therefore prioritise those patients who are in the most urgent need of care which regretfully can mean a longer wait for some of our other patients.

The dog was banned from Buckingham Palace because of the incident, but the Prince seemed to only see the funny side.Mrs Briggs has recalled what happened after she says Bendicks reacted badly when she started using the vacuum cleaner. She told The Sun her leg was left bleeding and her tights were ripped.The maid, then , was sent to the Duke’s personal physician for a tetanus jab, but when she quizzed a butler she was stunned by what she says was Andrewaposs reaction to the attack. She says “they just laughed - and nobody said sorry. “He wasn’t bothered, she said. Even when I was limping and my leg was purple he never apologised. It’s those little things that tell a lot about people and their character.” Bendicks also attacked a carpet fitter and the Duke’s equerry before his death in  aged , it was reported.

The former deputy head of mission in Bahrain, Simon Wilson, says the royalaposs travelling entourage left people speechless. The diplomat, who had previously hosted the Duke, says the Prince became known as HBH - His Buffoon Highness.  He added that Andrew was rude and boorish and wasnapost well-liked. Andrew is awaiting a civil sex case in the US, with the trial scheduled to take place between September and December. Virginia Giuffre is suing the duke for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager and claims she was trafficked by Andrew’s friend, the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, to have sex with the duke when she was  and a minor under US law. The Duke has always vehemently denied the allegations.

Everything had to be just right. It was so peculiar.” She added: “But he absolutely loved the ­teddies and was very clear about how he wanted them arranged.”Charlotte also told The Sun that staff were given a diagram on how to place his cuddly toys around his room.It reportedly included instructions on the placements of five of his favourite stuffed animals. Charlotte, who was  at the time, said that while she worked for the Duke of York there were  teddies she arranged every day. The Dukeaposs teddies were arranged on the floor in a pre-allocated spot in his room before bed. The biggest teddies were put at the back and the rest were in descending order of size to the smallest at the front. The princeaposs two favourite teddies were placed on mahogany thrones at his bedside, Charlotte claimed. She further said the vast majority of teddies were dressed as sailors, in unorms and caps, and came from all over the world.  Charlotte claimed that the prince frequently lost his temper with the staff, especiallyit involved his cuddly toys. She added: It took me half an hour to arrange them — most bizarre thing to be paid for. Andrew, , is now living with ex-we Sarah Ferguson at Royal Lodge in Windsor, but a suite of rooms was kept for him at the palace for overnight stays. It is understood his palace bedroom has been packed up and his teddy collection has been scaled back.  The allegations of the princeaposs bizarre requests come as more claims say the prince sketched out a plan for how his five teddies and cuddly toys should be positioned on his bed every night.It was said he would “scream and shout”his servants failed to place them exactly how he wanted at Buckingham Palace, ex protection officer Paul Page tells ITV ’s Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile.A handwritten guide is said to have included two hippos, a black panther and bears, as well as three cushions called aposDaddyapos, aposDucksapos and aposPrinceapos. It showed exactly where to place blankets, as well as five toys and a fur, which had ribbons that had to hang off the side of the bed. Page worked in Royalty and Specialist Protection Command between  and  and had access to the princeaposs private quarters.In this apartment, the Duke had a bed piled high with stuffed animals and toys, Page claims. He said: “It had about  or  stuffed toys positioned on the bed and basically there was a card the inspector showed us in a drawer and it was a picture of these bears all in situ. “The reason for the laminated picture wasthose bears weren’t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream.” Thecontacted the palace and Andrewaposs representatives for a comment.

But in late , it was reported that Andrew wanted toto public le with claims that he had his family backing to do so. However, speaking on True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Sunday Times royal editor Roya Nikkhah said when this story emerged, Charles was not happy. She explained: Everyone in the Royal Family has been of the view he couldn’t come back, except Prince Andrew, who did a litmus test with us last year when a source close to him said ‘he thinks he has a future role’. I went to the Prince of Wales with that and suffice to say the Prince of Wales was hopping mad because Andrew said he had family support to come back, and he did not have family support to come back to public le.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

A new sub-strain of the Omicron Covid iant is being investigated by scientists after it was discovered in the UK.At the present moment, there is no indication that sub-iant BA. is more severe than the original strain of Omicron. In Denmark, this strain consisted of about half of all Omicorn cases. Initial studies from the country are suggesting there is no increased risk of hospitalisation.  It is also thought that the current vaccines are effective against the BA. strain in fighting severe illness, according to Danish health officials. However, it is unclear whether the strain could be more transmissible as more data is needed to test that possibility. UKHSA are continuing to monitor data on the BA. sub-lineage closely. The strain BA. shares a number of similarities with BA., which is why they are both considered to be Omicron. However, it has dferent S-gene mutations compared to BA., which means when carrying out a PCR test BA. shows positive for the S-gene while BA. does not.Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at UKHSA, said: “This latest set of analysis once again demonstrates that a booster dose of the vaccine provides you with signicant protection against hospitalisation from Omicron.Booster doses also increase the protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection which will reduce transmission in the population.While signs remain encouraging on Omicron’s severity compared with Delta, the high levels of community transmission continue and may cause pressures on health services. “We’ll be undertaking further analysis to investigate the small rise in the number of children admitted to hospital but currently Covid- poses a very low health risk to children and infants.Early data shows that young children who are hospitalised experience mild illness and are discharged after short stays in hospital.“Getting your booster jab remains the most effective way of protecting yourself and others from infection and severe disease. While prevalence remains high, make sure to wear your mask in indoor settings and take a lateral flow test before meeting others. If you develop any symptoms, isolate immediately and get a PCR test.”Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: “This data is yet more evidence that vaccines remain our best line of defence against COVID-.“Booster jabs are protecting people against infection and severe disease – so I urge you to play your part in our national mission and get boosted now.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsPublic servicesOmicron iantCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Charlotte Briggs, , said she agreed to take on the job that “nobody wanted” six months after starting work at Buckingham Palace in January, . She claimed he was aposdemanding and entitledapos while swearing at her when he wanted a task done and that he behaved like a aposspoiled brat.apos On leaving open a gap in the curtains he said: “Can’t you f***ing do anything right,” claimed Ms Briggs.The mum of two from Halax told The Sun that Andrew kept  teddy bears, many in sailor outfits and also had his ex-we Sarah Ferguson’s wedding dress. Due to offensive behaviour, she said she would even try to hide to avoid him, including behind the big heavy curtains. Her claims come after Andrew was stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages by the Queen. He will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness.The action was taken after a judge decided he would have to face a civil trial on sex abuse allegations made by Virginia Giuffre.The Duke of York vehemently denies the allegations. Ms Briggs told the outlet when she started working for him, Andrew was  and had just orced Fergie while also a veteran of the Falklands War.  She said: “This man fought for his country in the Falklands but couldn’t stand up to close his own curtains. It was utterly ridiculous but spoke volumes about him. Andrew definitely put a downer on things. He thinks he’s above everyone.” Ms Briggs told how she had moved from Yorkshire for the job and Andrew was based on the “nursery floor” where he and his siblings had grown up. She said that despite being an adult he wouldn’t do anything for himself. “There were two of us and we worked on a rota from .am to .am and then later on in the evening. We’d turn down his bed, remove his teddies, do the curtains and lay out his pyjamas. But he was a bad apple and behaved like a spoiled brat, she claimed. “Really you weren’t actually meant to be seen, you’d just sneak in and do stuff. But he was a bit lazy and he would call down from his office and say, ‘can you send the maid to shut the curtains’. They were literally behind him and massive — from floor to ceiling and as high as a house but he refused to get up and close them himself. She said that it was frustrating as she couldnapost say anything and being only -years-old she would cry about what was happening. Ms Briggs claimed he was worse than ladies-in-waiting who would get up and do some things for themselves. But she added the other royals like Charles and Edward were lovely.

Nickie Murtagh, , a childminder from London, used the beds twice a week before discovering a dry patch on her scalp. It soon turned into a lump and she raced to the doctor before hearing the news she had basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer. Since successfully having the lump removed and a skin graft from her thigh, mum-of-three Nickie has been left with a bald patch on her scalp which she says looked like she has been shot in the head. Nickie now wears SPF all year round and wants to raise awareness of the dangers that sunbeds and sun damage can cause to your skin.Were you aware of this  Join the discussion in the comment section  She said: When I was in my twenties I would use a lot of sunbeds. I went a couple of times a week and would go on for about eight to  minutes. I didnapost exceed the recommended, so I didnapost think too much of it. I would also avoid using sun cream, especially on my face, because I didnapost want to stop myself from catching a tan. I thought that sun cream would stop me tanning, which I know now isnapost the case. First of all, I noticed a dry patch on my scalp which eventually turned into a lump in my parting line. I went to the doctors to get it checked out but they told me it was fine and nothing to worry about. I then went on holiday to Tenere and it got much worse. I was also getting bad melasma on my face and my tan was very patchy. My skin just didnapost feel right at all. After ing from her holiday, Nickie went back to the doctors where she says she was told, once again, that everything was fine. But the lump on her head was making her self-conscious, so she decided to go back to the doctors because she wanted it removed whether it was cancer or not. Nickie said: The doctors told me it was a cosmetic procedure and I would have to pay for it. I got really upset and eventually, they sent a referral to the dermatologist. After an appointment with the dermatologist, they told me they thought it was cancer straight away and biopsied me there and then. While waiting for the results, my family stayed so positive and reassured me it was going to be fine and although the dermatologist thought it was cancer, I still wasnapost really expecting it. Seven weeks later I received the results and I was told it was skin cancer - basal cell carcinoma. When I heard the C word I instantly felt like my world was ending and I was going to die. I worried about my kids and my family. It was terrying. I was offered radiotherapy or surgery. I chose surgery because it was less invasive and avoids the side effects that come with radiotherapy. I just wanted it to be gone. So I had surgery to remove the cancer and a skin graft from my thigh which was successful and I was given the all-clear. Nickie says that the skin graft was the worst part of her experience as her thigh would not stop bleeding. After having the staples removed from the area that the lump was removed from, she says that it was so gruesome and shocking. Nickie added: It was awful. It looked like I had been shot in the head. And I was terried to wash my hair and make it worse. My hair hasnapost and wonapost grow back in that area because the skin is from my thigh. And I have also lost all feeling in it. I canapost see it very well because it is on the top of my head, but it makes me feel self-conscious when I catch people staring at it or sometimes kids point it out. I try to use it to teach them a lesson to wear hats and sun cream. I also donapost like to wear shorts because people can see the scar on my leg from the skin graft. I am so much more cautious in the sun now and I avoid sunbeds at all cost. I am much more educated about sun damage and sun protection. I always wear a hat and I have SPF on every single day of the year. The sun doesnapost have to be hot to cause damage.

Another boy, found guilty of manslaughter for his part in the brutal stabbing of -year-old Reece, was jailed for six years. A court heard that the attackers - named Boy A and Boy B for legal reasons - had agreed to meet up in the early hours of May  in Walker Avenue, Bolton, because of an escalating dispute between Boy B and a friend of the victim. But when Reece arrived he was stabbed six times by Boy A. He banged on the door of a nearby house desperately pleading for help before falling to the ground.

Both teenagers appeared at a sentencing hearing at Manchester Crown Court todaywhere judge Justice Farbey was told there was a long-standing hate between Boy B and Reece, and Boy A had been brought into the dispute as support. During a three-week trial, jurors heard that the two boys had goaded Reece and his friend into meeting them, but he was initially reluctant. The court heard he had sent a message to his friend, which read: Getting brought into your s* again. Ainapost in no f**** mood. All four boys eventually agreed to meet that night and Reece left home and headed to the rendezvous point near Great Lever Park. But as Reece was en route, his friend informed him that he had decided to stay in bed.  Before the trial Boy A admitted to killing Reece but denied murder. Boy B admitted he was there but denied killing Reece or knowing Boy A had a kne. Richard Wright QC, who represented Boy A in the trial, told the court how the dispute was part of a petty subculture brought on via social media. Mr Wright said: It is a fact that they were all young people and a fact that their culture, that all of them engaged in, driven by social media led to them meeting up. He added: It might be said that all were particularly vulnerable due to their age, from being drawn into this petty sub-culture of social media interactions and bravado. They were all vulnerable to that and unfortunately one of them lost their le.  In a victim statement read out in court, Reeceaposs mum Laura said: Reece was our -year-old son, he made us smile, he made us laugh, he made us tear our hair out at times, a typical teenage lad, but he was ours. Reece was fiercely protective of his mum and little brother and saw himself as the man of the house. His dad saw him as his best friend. Reece was simply our world, and his death has devastated us beyond belief. Boy A was handed a -year-old sentence while Boy B was jailed for six years.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Court caseHospitalsCrown courtMurder trialCrimeTeenagersKne crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The North East of England has suffered some of the countryaposs highest Covid infection rates in . Experts say it is an Omicron hotspot after the outbreak moved north from London.The region was home to seven of the  local authorities with the highest infection rates this month. One in  peoplein the region tested positive in the week to January , the highest of any point in the pandemic.  The alarming rate of infection was highest in Middlesbrough with , cases per , people. Stockton came in third in England, Hartlepool fourth and Redcar fth in UK Health Security Agency research. Today education chiefs, politicians and ordinary voters united to condemn the Governmentaposs lting of compulsory mask wearing and working from home rules. Former steel worker Barry Heseltine, , of Redcar, North Yorkshire, said: He is lting the restrictions to save his own skin.  He is doing this to take away from the trouble he is in. But we will wear the masks for a while yet. His we Joyce, , added: I voted for him but he shot himself in the foot. He probably thinks it will blow over like everything . I thought he did well at first. Not now. Retired telephonist Patricia Blackett, , from Thornaby on Teesside, was wearing a mask and would continue to do so indoors at crowded venues like cinemas and theatres.  She added: I think the Prime Minister is trying to appease us and the people in the party. He is trying to take attention away from what he has done.Butyou have lost a loved one I donapost think that you will forget that and vote for him again. He has lost all credibility. I voted Tory but I am all for Keir Starmer now.He is a smart lawyer, a QC. I think that I will vote for him next time, the same goes for my daughter and son. Sixth formers Faith Lucas and Jessica Brown, both  and from Brotton, East Cleveland, are both planning to wear masks even after the Government lts the restriction.  Jessica, a psychology, business and law student, said: I think that I will keep on wearing one into the summer when it will become more dficult when it is hot. I think Boris is guilty of double standards with parties, he asked us to stick to the rules, but he did not do that himself. Faith added: You need to keep masks in enclosed spaces, especially on transport. I am not involved in politics just yet but obviously he should not have been having a party in lockdown. I know there is now a lot of pressure on him.Mum-of-two Pauline Collins, , of Middlesbrough, vowed to continue mask-wearing while shopping, on buses and on trains. I am not really sure about Boris Johnson, she said.I do think he should not be lting the restrictions completely. You should wear them on public transport and places like shopping centres. It is dferent for the young, they are not as worried about it as us oldies.  Singer John Rowland, , a dad-of-three who worked in Spain, Greece, Holland, Germany, Italy and Gibraltar before setting up as a busker in Middlesbrough town centre  years ago, said there is no saving Boris Johnson. Pardon the language, he has been a cluster****, he told the Mirror. It has gone too far for him now so it does not matter what he does. You look at other countries that have dealt with Covid so much better. I have friends in New Zealand, their leaders have handled it properly. He told how his we Hayley, , and children Grace, , Alex,, and eight-year-old Noah all went down with Covid before Christmas. He added: My we works in a school and got the Delta strain  months ago and she was really ill, and then we all got what was probably the Omicron iant. I was not at deathaposs door, it was like a bad flu virus. But I would not wish it on anybody, we have seen so many people lose loved ones.  Middlesbrough Labour MP Andy McDonald said his office was inundated with voters complaining about Boris Johnson. They are expressing their sheer anger at him. Welsh leader Mark Drayford summed it up, he said. He is being guided by the data and public health priorities, we are being driven by politics. I would be guided by the professionals who think we should maintain our guard for a little longer. On masks, people will make their own minds up and I support them fully on that. Almost  per cent of North East schools reported staff levels of below  per cent this week. At a quarter of them, it was less than  per cent. Only one in ten schools had student attendance levels of more than  per cent.  Chris Zarraga, director of campaign group Schools North East, said: Schools are still facing real challenges in getting staff cover, increasing staff workload and stress. There are serious concerns for schools, with local pictures often radically dferent from the national picture. The Government must support headteachers to put in place those measures necessary for their own school’s context. Andy Byers, headteacher at Framwellgate School, Durham, has asked students to keep wearing masks. More than  pupils and  members of his staff are isolating, with a small number quite poorly. In Stockton-on-Tees, pop up vaccination clinics are in place. Sarah Bowman-Abouna, their Director of Public Health, said: “We know uptake across Teesside is lower than other parts of the country. We are tackling this by making it as easy as possible for people to come to a walk-in centre. We want to discourage this myth that the Omicron iant is less serious than other iants. The truth is we can’t guarantee that infection will cause less serious illness so it’s vital we vaccinate as many people as possible.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonJohn Grosvenor RowlandConservative PartyEducationSchoolsPublic transportShopping centresFluPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirusDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Although busy schedules can sometimes get in the way of giving your bed a refresh, experts at the Sleep Foundation have revealed that we should all be washing our bed sheets at least once a week - insisting that every couple of weeks doesnapost cut it.And in some cases, you should be washing your sheets even more than the recommended amount of once a week. Experts have suggested that someone who suffers from asthma or allergies should wash their sheets more frequently to improve overall wellbeing.  Andyouaposre someone who sleeps with a beloved dog or cat, then you should consider throwing your sheets in the washing up to twice a week to get rid of germs and bacteria that your furry friends may have carried from their outdoor adventures. If youaposre someone who likes to eat snacks when in bed, you should also be washing your sheets more than once a week. And people who go to bed without showering, or people who sleep naked, should also follow suit and stock up on some extra washing powder.  The biggest mistake many of us make is leaving our bedding on for more than a week, as they warn it leads to us apossleeping while surrounded by body oils, bacteria, dead skin cells, and dust mitesapos. Keeping your bed clean and hygienic can help thwart germs and allergens, and has even been found to help you sleep better. When it comes to your duvet, it doesnapost need washing as often as your sheets, but itaposs always good to give them a good clean every now and then - ideally every two months. Pillows should be washed at the same time, and the mattress itself should be given a clean down once a year. According to recent research, % of people are more excited to go to bed when their sheets are fresh and smell good. So, itaposs time to get washing.Do you have any cleaning tips of your own  Let us know in the comments.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralCleaningSleep\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old explained that the orders are handed to the correct customer thanks to a handy camera. After an order is placed, a camera takes a snap of the car, linking it to the order. So the worker just has to match the picture with the car in front of them. She later joked: So maybe don’t pick your nose when you order … because we see it and we judge you. Since being posted, the video has wowed McDonaldaposs fans. One said: Wow really  I had no idea there were cameras. Another said: Ayo thataposs some new new. We didnapost have that when I worked there last year. A third said: Wait yaposall see us  Fellow employees also revealed that they can hear everything that goes on inside the customersapos car from the moment it pulls up and activates the sensor, which then triggers their headset to turn on. Iaposm waiting for the day they realise we hear them the moment they pull up, to the moment they leave the speaker box, the worker said.

The woman explained that after being together for four years, her fiancé finally moved in with her. She bought her home seven years ago, so the majority of the furniture is hers, but theyaposre talking of aposmaking it a home for both of them.apos But sheaposs noticed when his mum comes over she snoops and goes through her stuff.Taking to Reddit, she said: One thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little aposaffirmationapos post-it note on my monitor saying aposI am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great thingsapos.It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. Anyway, she made a comment about my ego... So while wine drunk one night, she and her friend decided to write a few more aposaffirmationsapos to hide as a joke. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Some were: Medicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful! Kitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self-assured! Work desk: I will not just f**k my way to the top of the company, I will f**k my way to the top of the world! Walk-in closet: I am beautul with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary! The next time her mother-in-law came over, she saw a few and while she didnapost directly acknowledge them, she did start acting really strangely. I went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea, she continued. She then showed him the notes and he didnapost really know what to make of it. He asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self-confidence and make myself laugh how had she gotten them  Had she been going through my things  He said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were really weird. He askedI left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private s**t so what I said about her needing to stop snooping. He said I was making stuff hard for him, his mum was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldnapost be a good partner when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me! She concluded her post by asking users whether she was out of order for playing the prank, and the majority of people were on her side as they slammed the mother-in-law for invading her privacy. While others criticised her fiance for not standing up for her. One person said: If you don’t set boundaries with your fiancé’s mother now, it’s going to be infinity times worse once you get married. Another wrote: It says a lot how he keeps defending her and chalks it up to be overprotectiveness. While I always hate to jump on the band wagon of aposomg this is immensely terrible you should break up over a moderate thingapos, I will say this is a red flag. A third commented: So you’ve been dating for four years. Are now engaged. And his mum is still uncertainyou’re right for each other  Someone  said: Itaposs such a light-hearted thing to do, surprised the joke flew over her head. Plus she wouldnapost have seen themshe hadnapost snooped apostidied.apos Maybe she is having trouble letting go of her son but silly notes arenapost cruel, theyaposre silly notes. While another added: Sheaposs snooping through your home. Iaposd have gone further and left little notes like, aposNobody likes a snoop,apos and aposYou arenapost welcome to go through my things.apos But yours were pretty damn funny.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The woman, known only as Charlotte, walked past a public park and noticed that one of the swings was moving on its own, and oddly there was no one around to have pushed it, as Dorset Live reports.She was walking her dog at the time, and at first, she thought there must have been someone in the park that she had missed, but after double-checking, she discovered it was empty. Now Charlotte is convinced that sheaposs seen the ghost of a child, still swinging in their favourite park - and admits sheaposs creeped out. Do you believe in ghosts  Let us know in the comments...Charlotte, from Dorset, said: As I was walking along, I saw this swing just keep swinging. There was no one in the park, no kids either, so it’s not assomeone had just jumped off and let it go. I noticed the swing and watched it for about - seconds. Then I stood there for about  seconds to film it, but even after I left it was still swinging. At first, it was a bit misty, but then I walked across the field and it got really misty to the point I couldnapost see in front of me. So I headed back to my car and headed towards the park when my dog started acting weird. Sometimes they say that animals can pick up these [spiritual] things and my dog was acting really weird. Normally, she runs off and wants to play, but instead she was by my side the whole time.It was like she could feel something. The mysterious incident happened on Tuesday, January , at around pm when it was particularly foggy - which only added to the spooky atmosphere. She continued: It was a bit of a creepy evening as lots of people also posted pictures of how foggy it was.

Bella was incredibly popular in Year  and across our broader student community. Bella has a sister Neve going into Year  and Ava going into Year . Bella’s older sister Portia attended Catholic College Bendigo. Our Learning Commons will open again on Monday between am to pm for our Year  studentsand any other members of our community who wish to gather, in a COVID safe environment.Please keep Linda, Leigh and their three girls in your prayers during this incredibly sad time.May Bella’s beautul soul rest in Peace.Darren McGregor, Principal.A gofundme page set up by close friends on behalf of the Canfield family said: Tragically on January th , Bella Canfield was struck by a car close to her home in Salisbury West and passed away.She was a beautul girl who was taken far too soon. Bell was so excited to start her le at uni in Geelong and was soon to be a wonderful nurse just like her big sister. Bella was so loved by all of her friends and family. She had the most contagious laugh and an unforgettable smile. All money raised will go directly to the Canfield family to provide support, celebrate Bella’s le and be put towards funeral costs.

The new legislation is a huge step forward as it means farmers and police are able to trace offending dogs’ owners and impose serious penalties.“We’re supporting the ‘Your Dog - Your Responsibility’ campaign to spread the message about the new law and encourage irresponsible dog owners to control their pets.

School librarians are fountains of knowledge, and during the pandemic, many of them went above and beyond to ensure children who were learning from home still had access to books – welcoming email requests and posting or hand-delivering titles to students.It is not unusual to see students of all ages congregating in the library, and it’s one of the only places in the school setting where young people aren’t filtered into year groups. It is a safe space for them to mix and spend time discovering worlds through the pages of a book, or use laptops and tablets to access trusted information. It is vital to ensure our school libraries offer a rich and erse range of reading materials which reflect dferent people, places and ideas. This ersity will help teach our children from a young age more about dference, inclusion, acceptance and kindness.The importance of our school libraries is recognised by the Scottish Government, which created a School Library Improvement Fundin . The fund has awarded £.m to school library projects to date, and this year’s funding awards have just been announced, with a strong focus on tackling racism and discrimination.Scotland is a wonderfully erse nation, and this ersity should be reflected in the bookshelves of our school libraries bookshelves. Everyone who uses the library should be able to see themselves represented in the literature, and often this is not the case. To tackle this, just less than £, of SLIF funding has been awarded to schools across Scotland.These are both excellent examples of how libraries and reading can expose children and young people to important social themes in an understandable and engaging way. By raising themes through reading for pleasure, and through school projects and learning material, we encourage important conversations. We also see evidence of how these library projects can involve the wider community, helping to build understanding and cohesion.Tackling discrimination and racism is a key challenge in Scotland. And while it’s not going to be solved by simply putting more books on the shelf, we can use these resources to start important conversations with our children and young people about ersity and inclusion. By encouraging them to read and discuss books based on cultures unlike their own, we are opening the door to a fairer, more accepting country.Pamela Tulloch is Chief Executive, Scottish Library and Information Council "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-forget-partygate-worst-lies-came-brexit-campaigners","story":"The real horror of Boris Johnson and his gang, in my opinion, is found in their lies about herd immunity and the real causes of unacknowledged, perhaps uncounted, lonely Covid deaths – especially of the old – in care homes throughout the UK.But the biggest, most treacherous lies of all came from those who drove us out of the EU, the ERG crew who currently run Westminster, hiding behind their plausible old Etonian clown, the con-man they placed, precisely for that purpose, as Prime Minister of this benighted Westminster administration.Watch them now as they lose their front man. It will be interesting to see how they move to save their own skins – and the plans they have for England.I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that Scotland moves soon to leave the horrible, terminal, mess at Westminster.

It keeps its failures off the front pages.A new year and the catastrophes mount up for the SNP Green alliance. An out of touch and too cautious Covid policy, pupils frightened to go back to the classrooms, the Ferguson shipyard in even more disarray, AE waiting times at an all-time low, retail businesses losing huge sums of money, underfunded local councils being forced to cut services, all while it raises taxes and does not even have the common sense to put off expensive new fire alarm regulations for hard-pressed homeowners. Constantly blaming Westminster is a convenient distraction for now, but these failures and others will not be forgotten come the May council elections.Defending a record like this on the doorstep will be rather dficult, especially since breaking up the UK does not provide convincing answers.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.SEND FOR MORDAUNTIF, or should that be when, Boris Johnson eventually steps down, I hope that the Tories select Penny Mordaunt as their new leader. Not that I particularly know or even care what her policies are, although of course I would want to see the UK governed well, and she could only improve on what we have.But as a fervent anti-nationalist, I have watched Ms Mordaunt effortlessly destroy Ian Blackford and the other SNP MPs so often on the floor of the House, using only facts and figures and a stunning grasp of what is going on in Scotland, that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see her as Prime Minister.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.DELUDED CLAIM ABOUT FORMER PMsI PRESUME the Covid restriction on restaurants in Dundee has now been fully lted, in order for Les Mackay to have sufficient chips on his shoulders as evidenced by his letter .His rant about our leaders schools is total nonsense, as he could have noted himself had he but bothered to check the simple facts. Over the last  years we have had  Prime Ministers, only three of whomhave attended what one might describe as an \"elite\" school all othersbeing products of their local grammar or high schools.

A classic example is Scotland Matters, which failed to disclose the London benefactor who contributed £, towards its anti-SNP campaign in the run-up to last year’s Scottish elections.The growing rise of the London think-tank industry and the numerous right-wing think-tanks which fail to reveal who funds them while acting as lobbyists and anonymous front bodies poses a far greater threat to democracy than the rare cases of voter fraud.The Elections Bill seems to be more about disenfranchising some voters than tackling the more important issues, including preventing overseas electors donating to political parties or referendum campaigns.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.KIEV DOES NOT DESERVE SUPPORTSOME media commentators appear to be excited about the prospect of a war over Ukraine, asit would be some video game and not a crisis that in the worst-case scenario could turn into a nuclear confrontation . And the political classes view the crisis as being a useful deflection from their economic and social problems at home. Meanwhile analysis of the origins of the crisis lacks any statesmanlike response, and is replaced by the knee-jerk reaction of sending arms to the regime in Kiev.And it is a regime that rules in Kiev, having come to power in a coup supported by the US and EU, when the pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine won an election. Since then Kiev has been underwritten politically as well as economically and militarily by the West, which at the same time expresses outrage at Russia giving similar support to the breakaway forces in the predominantly-Russian eastern Ukraine. Russian military manoeuvres in Belarus are a provocation, but Nato military manoeuvres in Poland apparently are not so. Sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander it would appear.Meanwhile the regime in Kiev, as corrupt as all its predecessors since independence from the USSR, has been eroding the rights of the Russian-speaking minority still under its control, limiting the use of Russian in political le and in education. More to the point, some present-day Ukrainian nationalists are following in the footsteps of their anti-Semitic forebears by erecting monuments to those who cooperated with the SS in the mass extermination of Jews, Communists and others during the Second World War. Back then, these Ukranian nationalists also fought alongside the German Wehrmacht and against the Red Army, which, no one now seems to recall, was the ally of Britain of that time.Instead of playing dangerous war games around a fictitious \"gallant little Ukraine\",there are any statesmen around, rather than political adventurists, they should be calling for new elections, internationally supervised, in the whole of the Ukraine, with the Russian-speaking east having full devolved rights in a federal state solution. Should that not be possible then the right of the eastern Ukraine to secede from the country should be recognised.The Russians in eastern Ukraine have as much right, should they choose, to secede as has any other national group which chooses to do so.Ian R Mitchell, Glasgow.Read more: End the lie that Boris Johnson has saved the UK from Covid"},{"url":null,"title":"best-online-trading-platforms-2022","story":" Best Trading PlatformsTrading cryptocurrency can indeed be very lucrative, but the risks involved are also signicant.

You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.What Is a Trading Platform In short, a crypto trading  is an online site that lets you buy and sell cryptos in an almost instantaneous way. Trading s can operate in numerous ways, but the most common is to simply match buy and sell orders between iniduals, often executing the transaction at the current market price. While some trading s will charge fees for facilitating these transactions, some of the best in the business don’t. A prime example of such a  is eToro. In fact, you can sign up with eToro within minutes should you wish. With this said, there are other, more specic factors relating to trading s too. These sites let you complete transactions in both fiat currency and through crypto pairs, their feesare typically much lower than other investment s, and they all have certain trading tools readily available. Examples of these would be trading charts, access to market history, and a running order book . All of these tools are there to help you make the most informed decisions possible when trading. gtgtgt Trade with eToro here ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider How Do Trading Platforms Work You can think of trading s as a middle man, helping investors to make crypto trades on either side of the equation - buying or selling. Trading s often use the current market price for all crypto coins, although users don’t necessarily have to trade at the current market price. Should traders set up any stop orders, engage in CFD or derivatives trading, or take part in leverage trading, the current market price has less importance. But regardless of which product or service you use, trading s are fundamentally there to let investors buy and sell cryptos, usually instantly, in a very simple manner.How to Sign Up to a Trading PlatformUnless a site lets you trade cryptos without setting up an account, you will be required to register to gain access to their products and services. With that said, evenyou can trade without registering, we’d recommend that you do open a new account to avoid any restrictions further down the line. Most trading s have a similar registration process these days, which is why we can give you a fairly accurate rundown of the sign-up process right here. gtgtgt Open an account with eToro here ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerHow to Choose the Best Trading PlatformIt would be easy to simply list some trading s and proclaim them to be the best in the business. But once you’ve read through some of the key areas below, we are sure that you will feel much more confident regarding what to look for in a top trading site.Design and Ease of UseWhile it is important to pick a trading  that has good quality products and services, the actual user experience is equally as important. After all, you could sign up with the most extensive trading  available, butyou have a hard time using the site, you won’t feel like it’s worth it. That’s why we like to source s that have simple navigation systems, user-friendly designs, and self-explanatory tools to keep everything as simple as possible. If all of this is available through both a desktop and mobile  - even better! Trading OptionsThe great thing about crypto trading is that it can be done in so many dferent ways. Evenyou initially sign up with a site with the intention of standard trading, you just never know whether you will get a taste for other trading products. With that said,you never have access to alternative products, to begin with, you certainly won’t discover dferent ways of trading. Therefore, picking sites that have a iety of trading options is always going to be beneficial. Fees and CommissionsWe’ve all been the victim of using sites that seem to have an extortionate and somewhat unfair system of fees charged to customers. With trading s, customers can incur fees when making deposits, processing trades, requesting withdrawals, and sometimes - fees can be charged for nothing at all, known as inactivity fees. Needless to say, getting charged such fees can leave a bitter taste in the mouth. ReputationThe days of finding trading s with some fairly obvious red flags are long gone. But this can be both a blessing and a curse. Since most s now have no real indicators to suggest that you should steer well clear, doing your research has become even more critical before joining any site. When we say ‘doing your research’, what we really mean is that you must check out a s reputation prior to jumping in with both feet. One of the best ways to do this is to look at current and previous customer reviews, and also to look at trustworthy comparison sites - although these can be a bit of a diamond dozen.Minimum Investment RequiredEducational ResourcesEducational resources are usually handed out free of charge at the top trading s. These can come in two main forms too - access to recent crypto news and actual resources explaining how dferent trading products work. For example, some sites have educational videos on leverage or CFD trading, as these can be more complex than other activities. And some sites will also have resources that you can view or read to learn about inidual crypto coins projects. This is often linked in with recent crypto news, and you can even get rewarded for checking out such resources - as seen with sites such as Coinbase. gtgtgt Visit eToro here to get started ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerFinal ThoughtsTrading s can feel quite complexyou are brand new to them. Butyou take the plunge and spend a little time learning about the tools, products, and systems they have in place, as you’ve done by reading this piece, we are confident they will become one of your favourite investment s of all.

But before we wrap this up, we’d like to leave you with a couple of reminders. Firstly, crypto trading is highly volatile, meaning the market can take drastic swings in either direction. This can have a huge impact on your holdings. Secondly, dferent trading products carry dferent levels of risk, and you should never trade using a product you don’t fully understand. Finally, don’t be afraid to do your homework and use the educational resources at your chosen site.The more trading knowledge you gather, the better your investment decisions will be, and the more likely it is that you will turn a profit in the long run.  gtgtgtto eToro now ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider FAQsAre trading s regulated Yes - trading s are regulated in their inidual countries of operation.

People are used to table service. In a full pub, there will be certain people who will be wary about that. It will be dferent. We’re two-and-a-half years doing it this way.“All of a sudden, to go back to the old way – not checking at the door, coming up to the counter to get your drinks, sitting at the bar – it will be all new.”Mr Cusack, who had Covid- over the Christmas period as Ireland reported record-breaking case numbers, said he was worried for his customers and his family.“It’s not so much me, it’s my family around me that I’m more worried about. My we’s parents are a good age, so you have to be cautious about that,” he said.Ian Redmond, the owner of the Tramline nightclub, had only enjoyed several weeks of trading before concerns over Omicron shuttered the venue once again late last year.“I’m feeling a sense of nervousness and trepidation that finally we might be at the end of this after  long months of being closed,” he said.“We did get to open for a -day period, we traded  nights. It was absolutely fantastic to see the trepidation on these , -year-old faces who had never been to a nightclub before.“They walked in the doors here to get hit by the sound from the DJs playing on the stage. It was just fantastic.” vw,vw,px, px\"Ian Redmond, owner of Tramline on D’Olier Street in Dublin’s city centre “There will be even more new -year-olds over the last couple of months that will be coming to Tramline for the very first time,” he predicted.The nightclub on Friday was in the middle of a minor renovation.Mr Redmond said:  “We’ve decided that we could open tomorrow night, but we’re going to wait until next week.”He was optimistic about the weeks ahead.“This has been a really tough time on DJs as well as live musicians,” he said.“They’ve been virtually out of work for the last two years. It has been horrendous for them.“With a bit of luck and a bit of good fortune, Covid and Omicron are all behind us and we can just look forward to the summer and getting out of this.”On the other side of the city at The Swan Bar, owner Ronan Lynch welcomed the moves to lt restrictions.He said: “I think everybody was a bit surprised by the way things moved so quickly.“From a business perspective, it’s like getting your Leaving Certicate results – really, really apprehensive.“For the last two years, it has been a rollercoaster all the way.“Hopefully this is the end of it now and we can concentrate on what we do best.”Mr Lynch said that he and his staff have been ready to get back to full opening with a moment’s notice.“Over the last two years, we nearly have a master’s degree at juggling the balls,” he said.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It was initially thought he would be unavailable for this weekend’s double-header after answering England’s SOS for the last Ashes Test but the early finish in Hobart has allowed him to get to the Caribbean with time to spare.George Garton could make his international bow after being one of a number of this -strong largely inexperienced England squad to cut short stints in the Big Bash – which Morgan insisted was the right approach. vw,vw,px, px\"George Garton could make his England debut When it was put to England’s limited-overs captain that playing in the Big Bash might represent better preparation with the T World Cup in mind, Morgan replied: “This takes guys out of their comfort zone a lot more.“Unless they play in finals or games that go to the wire in the Big Bash,I would agree with you but not many have been close games.“Here will take them out of their comfort zone because West Indies are a very talented side. They bat to number  so they will take us out of the comfort zone.“I think the whole tour, this one, is one where the development of our game is actually more important than the series win.”Paul Collingwood, who captained England to their first global trophy at this very ground in the  World Twenty, is overseeing the group as beleaguered head coach Chris Silverwood takes a breather. vw,vw,px, px\"Paul Collingwood, left, deputises for the under-pressure Chris Silverwood in the Caribbean Silverwood’s position seems to be under threat following England’s abject - defeat in the Ashes but Morgan revealed he has enjoyed working with the Yorkshireman in the two years he has been in charge.“I have been fortunate enough to see both sides of him, as a player and a coach,” Morgan added.“He’s been brilliant to work with. Our relationship is good, and healthy. I am trying to drive this side forward all the time and he is as well.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The changes we’re making will likely lead to a temporary rise in infections in the short term but we are advised that the impact of this rise will be limited by the scale of vaccination in the population,” he said.“It is important also to say that I can’t promise you there won’t be further twists in this pandemic requiring dferent decisions in the future but I do know this, solidarity with each other and trust in science has got us to where we are today and will get us through whatever  this virus may throw at us.”Mr Martin said there will be challenges ahead, including vaccinating the developing world.He added: “There is much to do, but today is a good day.The @hpscireland has today been notied of ,* confirmed cases of #COVID.In addition, on Thursday  January, ,** people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.— Department of HealthJanuary , “And we should all take a moment to appreciate how far we’ve come, to appreciate the effort and sacrice of those who put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe, to remember and appreciate the lives and contribution of those we lost.“We think of all those who died with Covid and indeed all those who passed away over the course of the last two years, who we were not able to mourn as we would have liked or as they deserved.“Today’s news would be warmly welcomed by many, but I’m conscious that some among us including our more vulnerable will be feeling some anxiety about re-engaging with others.“For those who do feel like that, I’d ask you to be open about it. Share it. We all need to be open with each other, be supportive of each other, mind each other.”He added: “Spring is coming.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school.

This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia. My own objective was to learn to speak Gaelic, a language I had not heard until I set foot on the island, which in those days was almost entirely Gaelic-speaking.Canna House, where Campbell lived with his we Margaret Fay Shaw, had much  to offer: a well-stocked Celtic library , and just as important, a series of Gaelic and literary visitors, arriving from all over western Europe and North America. Conversations at the dinner table were always lively. MacLellan of South Uist was still living, and though up in years was one of the best ever recorded and well worth visiting. century the Skye ethnographer Martin Martin remarks on the quality of South Uist Gaelic.Campbell had provided letters of introduction to his main Gaelic contacts.

When I stung my hand on the nettles, she said to apply a leaf of dock growing nearby.It gave instant relief, and she observed that the two plants were never far apart. She then recited a rhyme which I did not remember as well as I should have, but was able to recover years later from a neighbour from the Glen:‘Dock leaf smooth, mild, gentleThe nettle has stung me’Three decades later, when the project was only in its initial stages, John Lorne Campbell was approached about making available his extensive collection of field recordings to this national resource.As a long-time lover of technology as well as Gaelic traditions, he agreed without a moment’s hesitation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Andrew MaddenTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast city councillors have voted not to fly the Union flag at City Hall next month to mark embattled Prince Andrews birthday.It comes amid the fallout from the duke#s civil sex assault case, after a judge ruled earlier this month that Virginia Giuffre#s lawsuit against him should proceed.Ms Giuffre alleges Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.Read MoreRelief in Portrush as duke stripped of title at famous golf club amid sex caseUnder current rules, the Union flag is flown at Belfast City Hall on a number of designated days each year, set by the UK Government#s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport .Alliance councillor Nuala McAllister said her party have contacted DCMS proposing to remove Prince Andrew’s birthday from the designated list – instead proposing July  is added to mark the Battle of the Somme in its place.The flag was due to be flown on the building on February , the duke#s nd birthday, however SDLP councillor Donal Lyons proposed, given the controversy, that this should not go ahead.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Speaking during a meeting of Belfast City Council#s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee on Friday morning, Mr Lyons said the issue of flags in Belfast has been contentious in the past, however his proposals were not in this vein and not about issues relating to national identity, rather it was a question of what is right and what is wrong.Everyone, of course, is entitled to due process - but having a flag flown in your honour is not an entitlement, it#s a privilege, he said.We#ve seen schools, other councils, and even the Royal Family take steps to distance themselves from this situation. I#m not going to comment on the allegations facing Prince Andrew, they are well documented and widely known, but what I will say is how you make your argument reflects on your character.In a sexual assault case, to cast up ideas of gold-digging or paydays being sought, to suggest photographic evidence has been doctored, or to throw up terms like # memory# and seek to bring in health experts to claim constitutional protection and to seek to portray a victim as some sort of perpetrator - it#s nothing short of disgraceful and sends an appalling message to women and girls everywhere.I propose that we don#t proceed with the flying of the flag on the th of February, and in lieu of that discussions should take place among party group leaders to find a more less disagreeable occasion.DUP council group leader Brian Kingston, on the other hand, said his party would be opposing the proposal.The position of the DUP councillors is that we should abide by our policy to abide by the days designated by the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport at Westminster,” he said.We are certainly not blind to the allegations of gross misconduct against Prince Andrew and we share in the deep concern about these allegations, but we should await the outcome of the trial.The proposals were passed by a vote, with only the DUP members of the committee voting against.It comes after the Queen stripped the duke of his royal patronages, which saw him lose his honorary titles at Royal Portrush, Royal Belfast and Royal County Down golf clubs.Prince Andrew visited Royal Portrush when it hosted The Open back in  and later ed to the course to play a round later that year. A long-standing patron of the club, he opened its new clubhouse in .Virginia Giuffre claims she was trafficked by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was -years-old and a minor under United States law.The duke has repeatedly denied the allegations.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilSDLPMore On Belfast City CouncilHundreds back call to restore Belfast’s Wilmont House to former gloryBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelRegister for animal cruelty offenders is a step closer, says Poots PremiumJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fund PremiumViewpointOpinionIt’s worth travelling along green routeMost ReadTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageAll Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysSDLP leader considering motion to scrap deputy First Minister titleNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayRelaxation of Covid- restrictions agreed by Northern Ireland ExecutiveLatest Northern IrelandPublic split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsBelfastQuiz of the WeekHaul of weapons found in east BelfastBelfast councillors vote to stop Union flag flying on Andrew’s birthdayOriginal inquest file on Army shooting of teenager missing, coroner hearsLatestHospitality sector welcomes lting of restrictionsUS man accused of faking his own death remanded in custodyPoland’s ex-president Lech Walesa diagnosed with CovidTottenham continue talks as Wolves vow to ‘protect’ Adama TraoreBritish police granted extra time to quiz men over Texas synagogue stand-off,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Ariadna De Raadt FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMost signicant is the absence of a woman minister on this year’s list. Credit: Ariadna De RaadtJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA seasoned observer of Presbyterian Moderatoral elections will notice several important points about this year’s list.All four candidates are ministers in rural areas - from Portrush, Larne, Kilrea and Richhill. Usually there is at least one from the greater Belfast area or the main centres of population.Read MoreNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedSecondly there are no candidates from across the Border, even though every Moderator represents the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.There are lively Presbyteries in the Republic who might be expected to put forward a candidate, but their reluctance to do so may be because the current Moderator, the Rt Revd Dr Bruce, has spent a large part of his career ministering across the border.It is also interesting that only four ministers allowed their names to go forward this year, though there were greater numbers in some years past. This may be a coincidence, or it may be because fewer ministers want to shoulder the challenges of a high public profile which every Moderator faces, and particularly in these years when the PCI is involved in continued controversy about its policy on same-sex issues.Most signicant is the absence of a woman minister on this year’s list. The PCI has been constantly criticised for its failure to elect a female Moderator.Ironically it was the first main Reformed Church in Ireland to ordain a woman minister – the Reverend Ruth Patterson.

Most people wouldn’t mindthey’re doing exactly the same work as a colleague in an office or a factory, they’re not going to get worried about titles.”He added that he would support Mr Eastwood’s plans to scrap the deputy First Minister title to “take the energy out of it”.The last thing we want on the other side of an Assembly election in May is for the two largest parties to be at each others throats just because of a silly title.”More pressing issues, he said, included tackling a housing crisis, hospital beds and investment west of the River Bann in Northern Ireland.The issue, he said, had also shown “a strategic weakness” in unionism that considered that a unionist vote had more value than a nationalist.Most ReadTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageSDLP leader considering motion to scrap deputy First Minister titleAll Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysCo Down athlete lts , first prize at Miami fitness contestTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayRelaxation of Covid- restrictions agreed by Northern Ireland ExecutiveLatest Northern IrelandPublic split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsBelfastQuiz of the WeekHaul of weapons found in east BelfastBelfast councillors vote to stop Union flag flying on Andrew’s birthdayOriginal inquest file on Army shooting of teenager missing, coroner hearsLatestSt Patrick’s Day parade gets green light as Irish Covid restrictions easedRare De Heem painting at risk of leaving UKGood day for Ireland but time for politicians to ‘knuckle down’ – McDonaldHospitality sector welcomes lting of restrictionsUS man accused of faking his own death remanded in custody,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

So far the youths have engaged in wanton vandalism of ious areas of the village including putting dog faeces through letter boxes and damaging the villagersquos Christmas tree and festive lights last month.The RUC says it is vital that members of the public provide information which will bring an end of the vandalism problem.ldquoWe need the help of the community to bring those responsible to court, and without that help it will be very dficult to put an end to this problem, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Management at the GPT telecommunications plant in Ballynahinch have pledged to work towards ensuring that it continues to have a future following the weekend announcement of  redundancies.The company, which manufactures hi-tech switching equipment for the telecommunications industry, revealed on Friday that it is to slice its workforce by more than half.The job losses will reduce the workforce at the Antrim Road plant to .

The branches were burnt on a bonfire, and all plastic collected was taken to Drumnakelly dump for safe disposal.Among the workers who took part in the work day was Mrs Sheila Lewis-Crosby, who along with her husband John is the owner of the mill pond. She and Drumaness woman Mrs Carmel Mason cleared brambles constructing a path alongside the dam.After the clean-up, the secretary of the Friends of Drumaness, Dam Lisa Fagan, congratulated the volunteers and thanked local councillor Patsy Toman for initiating the venture.ldquoThe Drumaness people can be proud of our achievement here today, she said. ldquoThere is no doubt that the whole community is sickened by these incidents, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash People who take part in the after-dark practice of ldquolamping rabbits have this week been warned they are placing themselves in danger.The RUC has warned that people who dress up in combat clothing and walk around fields hunting rabbits with firearms could find themselves being confronted by a security force patrol.Over the Christmas and New Year period, the RUC received reports of ldquolamping in the Downpatrick and Crossgar areas and it also believed to have occurred around Saintfield.The practice has been a problem in the Castlewellan area for a number of years but it is relatively unknown in east Down.It involves hunters going into fields without farmersrsquo permission and shooting rabbits by torchlight.

It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations.

It has been highly infectious but has had minor health impacts.This is a time to celebrate the success of the vaccine programme, above all in the United Kingdom — a country of which we are lucky to be a part given that is a global scientic leader and played a key role in developing the medications.It is also a time to recognise the way in which the great bulk of people have, cheerfully enough, adapted to the new considerate ways of living in a pandemic.This experience will almost certainly help us to respond much more quickly to any future viral outbreak. Many people, for example, will want to continue to wear masks even when they cease to be mandatory.It might yet be that there is fresh, more dangerous outbreak of Covid. But we can no longer put le on hold due to that possibility.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Credit : Rob Youngson   Focus FeaturesThe film starts with the jollity of a tight-knit terraced neighbourhood being shattered by a riot intended to intimidate Catholics into moving out.Given the starting point, the threat of violence looms large for the entire film but it is not a well which Branagh taps too often. Instead he celebrates togetherness rather than ision, helped by a stand-out cast including Ciaran Hinds, Judi Dench, Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan.There are bits of dialogue reminiscent of the Derry Girls scene listing the dferences between the two religions that bring a chuckle.For example when Buddy, who doesn’t want to go to church, points out: “But Daddywe were Catholics we could not go to church, then every once in a wee while we could do it and confess. And then they’d have to tell us we were forgiven and we wouldn’t have to go in again for ages.”The film does have a certain feel-good factor which belies its backdrop. Ultimately, it could mean that Branagh’s heartwarming story, aided by an uplting soundtrack from Belfast’s own Van Morrison, is better received internationally rather than locally, where we’ve grown accustomed to expecting the worst to happen.Whether you’re watching the film in Belfast, Beirut or Boston it is hard to find fault in the film’s visual integrity – its wonderful black and white imagery is captivating on the silver screen.The often dark Northern Irish sense of humour is also given a good showcase, like when Buddy is trying to solve a mathematical problem with his granddad who tells him to make his numbers indistinct so his teacher will give him the benefit of the doubt.“But there’s only one right answer,” says Buddy.His Pop replies: “If that were true, son, people wouldn’t be blowing themselves up all across town.”• Belfast opens in the UK on Friday, January , though some special screenings of the film are taking place in Belfast this evening ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Wednesdays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"rules ease as ni considers ending all restrictions ","story":"What is making dogs sick on UK beaches  Cause behind mystery illness that has impacted hundreds of dogs   DUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleRules ease as NI considers ending all restrictionsThe dropping of a requirement for Covid certication to enter some hospitality venues and the reopening of nightclubs in Northern Ireland have been agreed by the Stormont Executive.By The NewsroomFriday, st January , : am  \"       \"  From today, the requirement to remain seated and the limit of six per table at hospitality venues will be removed.The cap on the number of households meeting inside domestic settings will be removed from the same date.The requirement to provide proof of exemption from wearing face coverings will also be removed from today, and the guidance on working from home will revert to working from home where you can.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It’s proportionate, it reflects the changing circumstances that we have in respect of Covid, and it is a step in the right direction, and hopefully we will continue to make progress at our meeting on February .”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that while the pandemic was not over, she believed Northern Ireland had passed the peak of omicron.She said: “The pandemic is far from over but we are cautiously optimistic. We believe we are through the peak and we believe we have some space now to be able to reverse the protections that we put in place over the course of the last number of weeks.“It is a positive picture but I would ask people not to be complacent yet.“I do think after our Executive meeting we hope we will be able to say positive things that will be welcomed by both iniduals and also by the hospitality sector.”The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for Covid- were notied by the Department of Health yesterday.The latest update from the Department shows that a total of , coronavirus fatalities have now been recorded.The figures also show , new infections, with  Covid-positive patients in hospital, and  in intensive care.l Morning View, page "},{"url":null,"title":"watch the reaction of some of the first people to see belfast film on official uk release date ","story":"Higgins in spotlight over political neutrality ahead of major Bloody Sunday event following ‘sectarian NI state’ comments from organisers   DUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleWatch the reaction of some of the first people to see Belfast film on official UK release dateThe News Letter spoke to some of the first members of the public in Northern Ireland to see Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast film on its official release date today.By Graeme CousinsFriday, st January , : pm  \"       \"  It got a resounding thumbs up from people who’d viewed it and those who hadn’t seen it yet were keen to do so as soon as possible.At the Odeon cinema in Belfast’s Victoria Square, the News Letter learnt that as of lunchtime today  people were booked for the .pm screening and a further  for the .pm showing, with even more expected tomorrow and Sunday.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
